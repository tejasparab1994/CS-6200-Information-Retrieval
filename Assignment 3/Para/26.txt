dust storm a dust storm is a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions dust storms arise when a gust front or other strong wind blows loose sand and dirt from a dry surface fine particles are transported by saltation and suspension a process that moves soil from one place and deposits it in another drylands around north africa and the arabian peninsula are the main terrestrial sources of airborne dust also with some contributions from iran pakistan and india into the arabian sea and china's significant storms deposit dust in the pacific.clarification needed it has been argued that recentlyclarification needed poor management of the earth's drylands such as neglecting the fallow system are increasing dust storms size and frequency from desert margins and changing both the local and global climate and also impacting local economies.1 the term sandstorm is used most often in the context of desert sandstorms especially in the sahara desert or places where sand is a more prevalent soil type than dirt or rock when in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility a considerable amount of larger sand particles are blown closer to the surface the term dust storm is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances especially when the dust storm affects urban areas  contents  causesedit as the force of wind passing over loosely held particles increases particles of sand first start to vibrate then to saltate leaps as they repeatedly strike the ground they loosen and break off smaller particles of dust which then begin to travel in suspension at wind speeds above that which causes the smallest to suspend there will be a population of dust grains moving by a range of mechanisms suspension saltation and creep.1 a study from 2008 finds that the initial saltation of sand particles induces a static electric field by friction saltating sand acquires a negative charge relative to the ground which in turn loosens more sand particles which then begin saltating this process has been found to double the number of particles predicted by previous theories.2 drought and wind contribute to the emergence of dust storms as do poor farming and grazing practices by exposing the dust and sand to the wind one poor farming practice which contributes to dust storms is dryland farming particularly poor dryland farming techniques are intensive tillage or not having established crops or cover crops when storms strike at particularly vulnerable times prior to revegetation.3 in a semi-arid climate these practices increase susceptibility to dust storms however soil conservation practices may be implemented to control wind erosion physical and environmental effectsedit saharan dust storms have increased approximately 10-fold during the half-century since the 1950s causing topsoil loss in niger chad northern nigeria and burkina faso in mauritania there were just two dust storms a year in the early 1960s but there are about 80 a year today according to andrew goudie a professor of geography at oxford university.67 levels of saharan dust coming off the east coast of africa in june 2007 were five times those observed in june 2006 and were the highest observed since at least 1999 which may have cooled atlantic waters enough to slightly reduce hurricane activity in late 2007.89 dust storms have also been shown to increase the spread of disease across the globe.10 virus spores in the ground are blown into the atmosphere by the storms with the minute particles and interact with urban air pollution.11 short-term effects of exposure to desert dust include immediate increased symptoms and worsening of the lung function in individuals with asthma12 increased mortality and morbidity from long-transported dust from both saharan13 and asian dust storms14 suggesting that long-transported dust storm particles adversely affects the circulatory system dust pneumonia is the result of large amounts of dust being inhaled prolonged and unprotected exposure of the respiratory system in a dust storm can also cause silicosis15 which if left untreated will lead to asphyxiation silicosis is an incurable condition that may also lead to lung cancer there is also the danger of keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry eyes which in severe cases without immediate and proper treatment can lead to blindness.citation needed economic impactedit dust storms cause soil loss from the dry lands and worse they preferentially remove organic matter and the nutrient-rich lightest particles thereby reducing agricultural productivity also the abrasive effect of the storm damages young crop plants dust storms also reduced visibility affecting aircraft and road transportation in addition dust storms also create problems due to complications of breathing in dust.16 extraterrestrial dust stormsedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces

damaged shoreline and almost 85 of its trees removed a revitalization and reforestation program began in 2005.29 preparations and planning have been underway since 2003 and were first tested when hurricane ophelia was forecast to brush near nova scotia in early september 2005.35 hurricane juan has also resulted in several changes to the meteorological service of canada's canadian hurricane centre which has relocated from a vulnerable and exposed location in an office building in dartmouth nova scotia to a more secure location that can withstand hurricane damage chc's hurricane warning system has also been improved traditionally chc did not issue standard hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings just high wind and heavy rainfall warnings which were often not heeded by local residents beginning in the 2004 atlantic hurricane season chc began using standard hurricane warnings for storms potentially affecting canada.36 canada issued its first hurricane warning in 2008 in anticipation of hurricane kyle and in 2009 issued its second hurricane watch in anticipation of hurricane bill hurricane juan lent its name to a severe blizzard that struck nova scotia and prince edward island a few months later in february 2004 which quickly became known as white juan because the paralyzing effects of the massive snowfall evoked the recent hurricane retirementedit because of its effects in canada the name juan was retired in april 2004 and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane environment canada noted that its request for retirement was in consideration of the lost and damaged lives the impact to economy and the widespread destruction of trees throughout two provinces.37 it was the first time that the meteorological service of canada had specifically requested a hurricane name be retired.38 the name was replaced by joaquin for the 2009 season but since it was not used during that year it was used in the 2015 season although it was later retired

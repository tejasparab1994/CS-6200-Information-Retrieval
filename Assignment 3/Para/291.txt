modern-day fars province hence the name persian farsi.14 a persian-speaking person may be referred to as persophone.15 there are approximately 110 million persian speakers worldwide with the language holding official status in iran afghanistan and tajikistan for centuries persian has also been a prestigious cultural language in other regions of western asia central asia and south asia by the various empires based in the regions.16 persian has had a considerable mainly lexical influence on neighboring languages particularly the turkic languages in central asia caucasus and anatolia neighboring iranian languages as well as armenian georgian and indo-aryan languages especially urdu a register of hindustani it also exerted some influence on arabic particularly bahrani arabic17 while borrowing much vocabulary from it after the arab conquest of iran.10131819202122  contents  classificationedit persian is one of the western iranian languages within the indo-european family other western iranian languages are the kurdish languages gilaki mazanderani talysh and balochi persian is classified as a member of the southwestern subgroup within western iranian along with lari kumzari and luri.23 etymologyedit persian language name in persianedit in persian the language is known by several names persian language name in englishedit in modern english the word farsi refers to

persian and iranian persian.41 currently voice of america bbc world service deutsche welle and radio free europe/radio liberty use persian service for their broadcasts in the language radio free europe/radio liberty also includes a tajik service and an afghan dari service this is also the case for the american association of teachers of persian the centre for promotion of persian language and literature and many of the leading scholars of the persian language.42 historyedit western iranian languages old persian cuneiform pahlavi scripts  manichaean alphabet  avestan alphabet persian alphabet  tajiki cyrillic alphabet according to available documents the persian language is the only iranian language10 for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that old middle and new persian represent1044 one and the same language of persian that is new persian is a direct descendant of middle and old persian.44 the known history of the persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periods old persianedit as a written language old persian is attested in royal achaemenid inscriptions the oldest known text written in old persian is from the behistun inscription.45 examples of old persian have been found in what is now iran romania gherla464748 armenia bahrain iraq turkey and egypt.4950 old persian is one of the oldest indo-european languages which is attested in original texts.51 xenophon a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 bc which is at a time when old persian was the only form of persian used he relates that the armenians spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the persians.52 middle persianedit the native name of middle persian was parsig or parsik after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest that is of pars old persian parsa new persian fars this is the origin of the name farsi as it is today used to signify new persian following the collapse of the sassanid state parsik came to be applied exclusively to either middle or new persian that was written in the arabic script from about the 9th century onward as middle persian was on the threshold of becoming new persian the older form of the language came to be erroneously called pahlavi which was actually but one of the writing systems used to render both middle persian as well as various other middle iranian languages that writing system had previously been adopted by the sassanids who were persians i.e from the southwest from the preceding arsacids who were parthians i.e from the northeast while ibn al-muqaffa eighth century still distinguished between pahlavi i.e parthian and persian in arabic text al-farisiyah i.e middle persian this distinction is not evident in arab commentaries written after that date gernot windfuhr considers new persian as an evolution of the old persian language and the middle persian language53 but also states that none of the known middle persian dialects is the direct predecessor of modern persian.5455 ludwig paul states the language of the shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from middle to new persian.56 new persianedit new persian is conventionally divided into three stages early new persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of contemporary persian as the morphology and to a lesser extent the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stable.57 early new persianedit new persian is taken to replace middle persian in the course of the 8th to 9th centuries under abbasid rule.58 with the decline of the abbasids began the reestablishment of persian national life and persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters new persian as an independent literary language first emerges in bactria through the adaptation of the spoken form of sassanian middle persian court language called dari the cradle of the persian literary renaissance lay in the east of greater iran in greater khorasan and transoxiana close to the amu darya modern day afghanistan.59 abbas of merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer persian tongue and after him the poems of hanzala badghisi were among the most famous between the persian-speakers of the time.60 the first poems of the persian language a language historically called dari emerged in afghanistan.61 the first significant persian poet was rudaki he flourished in the 10th century when the samanids were at the height of their power his reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived although little of his poetry has been preserved among his lost works is versified fables collected in the kalila wa dimna.16 the language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which among others central asian turks became familiar with islam and urban culture new persian was widely used as a trans-regional lingua franca a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least 19th century.58 in the late middle ages new islamic literary languages were created on the persian model ottoman turkish chagatai and urdu which are regarded as structural daughter languages of persian.58 classical persianedit classical persian loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval persia used in literature and poetry this is the language of the 10th to 12th centuries which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the persianized turko-mongol dynasties during the 12th to 15th centuries and under restored persian rule during the 16th to 19th centuries.62 persian during this time served as lingua franca of greater persia and of much of the indian subcontinent it was also the official and cultural language of many islamic dynasties including the samanids buyids tahirids ziyarids the mughal empire timurids ghaznavids seljuqs khwarazmians the sultanate of rum the shirvanshahs safavids afsharids zands qajars ottomans and also many mughal successors such as the nizam of hyderabad persian was the only non-european language known and used by marco polo at the court of kublai khan and in his journeys through china.63 use in asia minoredit despite anatolia having been ruled at various times prior to the middle ages by various persian-speaking dynasties originating in iran the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the sasanian empire centuries later however the practise and usage of persian in the region would be strongly revived a branch of the seljuks the sultanate of rum took persian language art and letters to anatolia.64 they adopted persian language as the official language of the empire.65 the ottomans which can roughly be seen as their eventual successors took this tradition over persian was the official court language of the empire and for some time the official language of the empire.66 the educated and noble class of the ottoman empire all spoke persian such as sultan selim i despite being safavid iran's archrival and a staunch opposer of shia islam.67 it was a major literary language in the empire.68 some of the noted earlier persian works during the ottoman rule are idris bidlisi's hasht bihisht which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight ottoman rulers and the salim-namah a glorification of selim i.67 after a period of several centuries ottoman turkish which was highly persianised itself had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation.69 however the number of persian and arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%.69 use in south asiaedit the persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in west asia europe central asia and south asia following the turko-persian ghaznavid conquest of south asia persian was firstly introduced in the region by turkic central asians.70 the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various persianized central asian turkic and afghan dynasties.64 for five centuries prior to the british colonization persian was widely used as a second language in the indian subcontinent due to the admiration the mughals who were of turco-mongol origin had for the foreign language it took prominence as the language of culture and education in several muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole official language under the mughal emperors beginning in 1843 though english and hindustani gradually replaced persian in importance on the subcontinent.71 evidence of persian's historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the indian subcontinent words borrowed from persian are still quite commonly used in certain indo-aryan languages especially urdu also historically known as hindustani there is also a small population of zoroastrian iranis in india who migrated around 16th-18th century to escape religious execution in qajar iran and speak a dari dialect contemporary persianedit in the 19th century under the qajar dynasty the dialect spoken in tehran rose to prominence this became the basis of what is now known as contemporary standard persian varietiesedit there are three modern varieties of standard persian all these three varieties are based on the classic persian literature and its literary tradition there are also several local dialects from iran afghanistan and tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard persian the hazaragi dialect in central afghanistan and pakistan herati in western afghanistan darwazi in afghanistan and tajikistan and the tehrani accent in iran the basis of standard iranian persian are examples of these dialects persian-speaking peoples of iran afghanistan and tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility.72 the following are some languages closely related to persian or in some cases are considered dialects phonologyedit iranian persian has six vowels and twenty-three consonants vowelsedit there are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the iranian system such as toosarvandani 2004 that offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity which often suggests that modern persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of classical persian and a hypothetical future persian which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active feature the length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties including tajik consonantsedit grammaredit morphologyedit suffixes predominate persian morphology though there are a small number of prefixes.79 verbs can express tense and aspect and they agree with the subject in person and number.80 there is no grammatical gender in persian and pronouns are not marked for natural gender syntaxedit vocabularyedit native word formationedit influencesedit while having a lesser influence on arabic19 and other languages of mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of middle persian origin13 new persian contains a considerable amount of arabic lexical items101820 which were persianized21 and often took a different meaning and usage than the arabic original persian loanwords of arabic origin especially include islamic terms the arabic vocabulary in other iranian turkic and indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from new persian not from arabic itself.81 john r perry in his article lexical areas and semantic fields of arabic estimates that about 24 percent of an everyday vocabulary of 20000 words in current persian and more than 25 percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern persian literature are of arabic origin the text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area it may approach 25 percent of a text in literature.82 among the arabic loan words relatively few 14 percent are from the semantic domain of material culture while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual life.83 most of the arabic words used in persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in persian.84 orthographyedit the vast majority of modern iranian persian and dari text is written with the arabic script tajiki which is considered by some linguists to be a persian dialect influenced by russian and the turkic languages of central asia9596 is written with the cyrillic script in tajikistan see tajik alphabet persian alphabetedit additionsedit the persian alphabet adds four letters to the arabic alphabet variationsedit the letters different in shape are latin alphabetedit another latin alphabet based on the common turkic alphabet was used in tajikistan in the 1920s and 1930s the alphabet was phased out in favor of cyrillic in the late 1930s.95 tajik alphabetedit the cyrillic script was introduced for writing the tajik language under the tajik soviet socialist republic in the late 1930s replacing the latin alphabet that had been used since the october revolution and the persian script that had been used earlier after 1939 materials published in persian in the persian script were banned from the country.9598 examplesedit the following text is from article 1 of the universal declaration of human

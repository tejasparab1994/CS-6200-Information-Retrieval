mass mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its resistance to acceleration a change in its state of motion when a net force is applied.1 it also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies the basic si unit of mass is the kilogram kg in physics mass is not the same as weight even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses an object on the moon would weigh less than it does on earth because of the lower gravity but it would still have the same mass this is because weight is a force while mass is the property that along with gravity determines the strength of this force in newtonian physics mass can be generalized as the amount of matter in an object however at very high speeds special relativity states that the kinetic energy of its motion becomes a significant additional source of mass thus any stationary body having mass has an equivalent amount of energy and all forms of energy resist acceleration by a force and have gravitational attraction in modern physics matter is not a fundamental concept because its definition has proven elusive there are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass although some theorists have speculated that some of these phenomena could be independent of each other2 current experiments have found no difference in results regardless of how it is measured  contents  units of massedit other units are accepted for use in si outside the si system other units of mass include definitions of massedit in physical science one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of mass or seven physical notions that involve the concept of mass.5 every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be proportional and in some cases equal and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass there are a number of ways mass can be measured or operationally defined weight vs massedit inertial vs gravitational massedit although inertial mass passive gravitational mass and active gravitational mass are conceptually distinct no experiment has ever unambiguously demonstrated any difference between them in classical mechanics newton's third law implies that active and passive gravitational mass must always be identical or at least proportional but the classical theory offers no compelling reason why the gravitational mass has to equal the inertial mass that it does is merely an empirical fact albert einstein developed his general theory of relativity starting from the assumption that this correspondence between inertial and passive gravitational mass is not accidental that no experiment will ever detect a difference between them the weak version of the equivalence principle however in the resulting theory gravitation is not a force and thus not subject to newton's third law so the equality of inertial and active gravitational mass ... remains as puzzling as ever.8 the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses is sometimes referred to as the galilean equivalence principle or the weak equivalence principle the most important consequence of this equivalence principle applies to freely falling objects suppose we have an object with inertial and gravitational masses m and m respectively if the only force acting on the object comes from a gravitational field g combining newton's second law and the gravitational law yields the acceleration this says that the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass of any object is equal to some constant k if and only if all objects fall at the same rate in a given gravitational field this phenomenon is referred to as the universality of free-fall in addition the constant k can be taken to be 1 by defining our units appropriately. the universality of free-fall only applies to systems in which gravity is the only acting force all other forces especially friction and air resistance must be absent or at least negligible for example if a hammer and a feather are dropped from the same height through the air on earth the feather will take much longer to reach the ground the feather is not really in free-fall because the force of air resistance upwards against the feather is comparable to the downward force of gravity on the other hand if the experiment is performed in a vacuum in which there is no air resistance the hammer and the feather should hit the ground at exactly the same time assuming the acceleration of both objects towards each other and of the ground towards both objects for its own part is negligible this can easily be done in a high school laboratory by dropping the objects in transparent tubes that have the air removed with a vacuum pump it is even more dramatic when done in an environment that naturally has a vacuum as david scott did on the surface of the moon during apollo 15 a stronger version of the equivalence principle known as the einstein equivalence principle or the strong equivalence principle lies at the heart of the general theory of relativity einstein's equivalence principle states that within sufficiently small regions of space-time it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform acceleration and a uniform gravitational field thus the theory postulates that the force acting on a massive object caused by a gravitational field is a result of the object's tendency to move in a straight line in other words its inertia and should therefore be a function of its inertial mass and the strength of the gravitational field origin of massedit in theoretical physics a mass generation mechanism is a theory which attempts to explain the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of physics to date a number of different models have been proposed which advocate different views of the origin of mass the problem is complicated by the fact that the notion of mass is strongly related to the gravitational interaction but a theory of the latter has not been yet reconciled with the currently popular model of particle physics known as the standard model pre-newtonian conceptsedit weight as an amountedit the concept of amount is very old and predates recorded history humans at some early era realized that the weight of a collection of similar objects was directly proportional to the number of objects in the collection where w is the weight of the collection of similar objects and n is the number of objects in the collection proportionality by definition implies that two values have a constant ratio an early use of this relationship is a balance scale which balances the force of one object's weight against the force of another object's weight the two sides of a balance scale are close enough that the objects experience similar gravitational fields hence if they have similar masses then their weights will also be similar this allows the scale by comparing weights to also compare masses consequently historical weight standards were often defined in terms of amounts the romans for example used the carob seed carat or siliqua as a measurement standard if an object's weight was equivalent to 1728 carob seeds then the object was said to weigh one roman pound if on the other hand the object's weight was equivalent to 144 carob seeds then the object was said to weigh one roman ounce uncia the roman pound and ounce were both defined in terms of different sized collections of the same common mass standard the carob seed the ratio of a roman ounce 144 carob seeds to a roman pound 1728 carob seeds was planetary motionedit in 1600 ad johannes kepler sought employment with tycho brahe who had some of the most precise astronomical data available using brahe's precise observations of the planet mars kepler spent the next five years developing his own method for characterizing planetary motion in 1609 johannes kepler published his three laws of planetary motion explaining how the planets orbit the sun in kepler's final planetary model he described planetary orbits as following elliptical paths with the sun at a focal point of the ellipse kepler discovered that the square of the orbital period of each planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit or equivalently that the ratio of these two values is constant for all planets in the solar system.note 4 on 25 august 1609 galileo galilei demonstrated his first telescope to a group of venetian merchants and in early january 1610 galileo observed four dim objects near jupiter which he mistook for stars however after a few days of observation galileo realized that these stars were in fact orbiting jupiter these four objects later named the galilean moons in honor of their discoverer were the first celestial bodies observed to orbit something other than the earth or sun galileo continued to observe these moons over the next eighteen months and by the middle of 1611 he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods galilean free falledit sometime prior to 1638 galileo turned his attention to the phenomenon of objects in free fall attempting to characterize these motions galileo was not the first to investigate earth's gravitational field nor was he the first to accurately describe its fundamental characteristics however galileo's reliance on scientific experimentation to establish physical principles would have a profound effect on future generations of scientists it is unclear if these were just hypothetical experiments used to illustrate a concept or if they were real experiments performed by galileo10 but the results obtained from these experiments were both realistic and compelling a biography by galileo's pupil vincenzo viviani stated that galileo had dropped balls of the same material but different masses from the leaning tower of pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.note 5 in support of this conclusion galileo had advanced the following theoretical argument he asked if two bodies of different masses and different rates of fall are tied by a string does the combined system fall faster because it is now more massive or does the lighter body in its slower fall hold back the heavier body the only convincing resolution to this question is that all bodies must fall at the same rate.11 a later experiment was described in galileo's two new sciences published in 1638 one of galileo's fictional characters salviati describes an experiment using a bronze ball and a wooden ramp the wooden ramp was 12 cubits long half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick with a straight smooth polished groove the groove was lined with parchment also smooth and polished as possible and into this groove was placed a hard smooth and very round bronze ball the ramp was inclined at various angles to slow the acceleration enough so that the elapsed time could be measured the ball was allowed to roll a known distance down the ramp and the time taken for the ball to move the known distance was measured the time was measured using a water clock described as follows galileo found that for an object in free fall the distance that the object has fallen is always proportional to the square of the elapsed time newtonian massedit by finding the exact relationship between a body's gravitational mass and its gravitational field newton provided a second method for measuring gravitational mass the mass of the earth can be determined using kepler's method from the orbit of earth's moon or it can be determined by measuring the gravitational acceleration on the earth's surface and multiplying that by the square of the earth's radius the mass of the earth is approximately three millionths of the mass of the sun to date no other accurate method for measuring gravitational mass has been discovered.18 newton's cannonballedit newton's cannonball was a thought experiment used to bridge the gap between galileo's gravitational acceleration and kepler's elliptical orbits it appeared in newton's 1728 book a treatise of the system of the world according to galileo's concept of gravitation a dropped stone falls with constant acceleration down towards the earth however newton explains that when a stone is thrown horizontally meaning sideways or perpendicular to earth's gravity it follows a curved path for a stone projected is by the pressure of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path which by the projection alone it should have pursued and made to describe a curve line in the air and through that crooked way is at last brought down to the ground and the greater the velocity is with which it is projected the farther it goes before it falls to the earth.17:513 newton further reasons that if an object were projected in an horizontal direction from the top of a high mountain with sufficient velocity it would reach at last quite beyond the circumference of the earth and return to the mountain from which it was projected.citation needed universal gravitational massedit in contrast to earlier theories e.g celestial spheres which stated that the heavens were made of entirely different material newton's theory of mass was groundbreaking partly because it introduced universal gravitational mass every object has gravitational mass and therefore every object generates a gravitational field newton further assumed that the strength of each object's gravitational field would decrease according to the square of the distance to that object if a large collection of small objects were formed into a giant spherical body such as the earth or sun newton calculated the collection would create a gravitational field proportional to the total mass of the body17:397 and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body's center.17:221note 6 for example according to newton's theory of universal gravitation each carob seed produces a gravitational field therefore if one were to gather an immense number of carob seeds and form them into an enormous sphere then the gravitational field of the sphere would be proportional to the number of carob seeds in the sphere hence it should be theoretically possible to determine the exact number of carob seeds that would be required to produce a gravitational field similar to that of the earth or sun in fact by unit conversion it is a simple matter of abstraction to realize that any traditional mass unit can theoretically be used to measure gravitational mass measuring gravitational mass in terms of traditional mass units is simple in principle but extremely difficult in practice according to newton's theory all objects produce gravitational fields and it is theoretically possible to collect an immense number of small objects and form them into an enormous gravitating sphere however from a practical standpoint the gravitational fields of small objects are extremely weak and difficult to measure newton's books on universal gravitation were published in the 1680s but the first successful measurement of the earth's mass in terms of traditional mass units the cavendish experiment did not occur until 1797 over a hundred years later cavendish found that the earth's density was 5.448  0.033 times that of water as of 2009 the earth's mass in kilograms is only known to around five digits of accuracy whereas its gravitational mass is known to over nine significant figures.clarification needed given two objects a and b of masses ma and mb separated by a displacement rab newton's law of gravitation states that each object exerts a gravitational force on the other of magnitude where g is the universal gravitational constant the above statement may be reformulated in the following way if g is the magnitude at a given location in a gravitational field then the gravitational force on an object with gravitational mass m is this is the basis by which masses are determined by weighing in simple spring scales for example the force f is proportional to the displacement of the spring beneath the weighing pan as per hooke's law and the scales are calibrated to take g into account allowing the mass m to be read off assuming the gravitational field is equivalent on both sides of the balance a balance measures relative weight giving the relative gravitation mass of each object inertial massedit inertial mass is the mass of an object measured by its resistance to acceleration this definition has been championed by ernst mach1920 and has since been developed into the notion of operationalism by percy w bridgman.2122 the simple classical mechanics definition of mass is slightly different than the definition in the theory of special relativity but the essential meaning is the same in classical mechanics according to newton's second law we say that a body has a mass m if at any instant of time it obeys the equation of motion where f is the resultant force acting on the body and a is the acceleration of the body's centre of mass.note 7 for the moment we will put aside the question of what force acting on the body actually means this equation illustrates how mass relates to the inertia of a body consider two objects with different masses if we apply an identical force to each the object with a bigger mass will experience a smaller acceleration and the object with a smaller mass will experience a bigger acceleration we might say that the larger mass exerts a greater resistance to changing its state of motion in response to the force however this notion of applying identical forces to different objects brings us back to the fact that we have not really defined what a force is we can sidestep this difficulty with the help of newton's third law which states that if one object exerts a force on a second object it will experience an equal and opposite force to be precise suppose we have two objects of constant inertial masses m1 and m2 we isolate the two objects from all other physical influences so that the only forces present are the force exerted on m1 by m2 which we denote f12 and the force exerted on m2 by m1 which we denote f21 newton's second law states that where a1 and a2 are the accelerations of m1 and m2 respectively suppose that these accelerations are non-zero so that the forces between the two objects are non-zero this occurs for example if the two objects are in the process of colliding with one another newton's third law then states that and thus additionally mass relates a body's momentum p to its linear velocity v and the body's kinetic energy k to its velocity atomic massedit mass in relativityedit special relativityedit in special relativity there are two kinds of mass rest mass invariant massnote 8 and relativistic mass which increases with velocity rest mass is the newtonian mass as measured by an observer moving along with the object relativistic mass is the total quantity of energy in a body or system divided by c2 the two are related by the following equation the invariant mass of systems is the same for observers in all inertial frames while the relativistic mass depends on the observer's frame of reference in order to formulate the equations of physics such that mass values do not change between observers it is convenient to use rest mass the rest mass of a body is also related to its energy e and the magnitude of its momentum p by the relativistic energy-momentum equation so long as the system is closed with respect to mass and energy both kinds of mass are conserved in any given frame of reference the conservation of mass holds even as some types of particles are converted to others matter particles such as atoms may be converted to non-matter particles such as photons of light but this does not affect the total amount of mass or energy although things like heat may not be matter all types of energy still continue to exhibit mass.note 926 thus mass and energy do not change into one another in relativity rather both are names for the same thing and neither mass nor energy appear without the other the relativistic mass and energy concepts are related to their rest counterparts but they do not have the same value as their rest counterparts in systems where there is a net momentum because the relativistic mass is proportional to the energy it has gradually fallen into disuse among physicists.27 there is disagreement over whether the concept remains useful pedagogically.282930 in bound systems the binding energy must often be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system because binding energy commonly leaves the system at the time it is bound the mass of the system changes in this process merely because the system was not closed during the binding process so the energy escaped for example the binding energy of atomic nuclei is often lost in the form of gamma rays when the nuclei are formed leaving nuclides which have less mass than the free particles nucleons of which they are composed general relativityedit in general relativity the equivalence principle is any of several related concepts dealing with the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass at the core of this assertion is albert einstein's idea that the gravitational force as experienced locally while standing on a massive body such as the earth is the same as the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial i.e accelerated frame of reference mass in quantum physicsedit after quantization replacing the position vector x with a wave function the parameter m appears in the kinetic energy operator in the ostensibly covariant relativistically invariant dirac equation and in natural units this becomes tachyonic particles and imaginary complex massedit a tachyonic field or simply tachyon is a quantum field with an imaginary mass.34 although tachyons particles that move faster than light are a purely hypothetical concept not generally believed to exist3435 fields with imaginary mass have come to play an important role in modern physics36363738 and are discussed in popular books on physics.3439 under no circumstances do any excitations ever propagate faster than light in such theories  the presence or absence of a tachyonic mass has no effect whatsoever on the maximum velocity of signals there is no violation of causality.40 while the field may have imaginary mass any physical particles do not the imaginary mass shows that the system becomes unstable and sheds the instability by undergoing a type of phase transition called tachyon condensation closely related to second order phase transitions that results in symmetry breaking in current models of particle physics the term tachyon was coined by gerald feinberg in a 1967 paper41 but it was soon realized that feinberg's model in fact did not allow for superluminal speeds.40 instead the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration: any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons this process is known as tachyon condensation well known examples include the condensation of the higgs boson in particle physics and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass the mass is not quantized rather the scalar field is even for tachyonic quantum fields the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute or anticommute thus preserving causality therefore information still does not propagate faster than light41 and solutions grow exponentially but not superluminally there is no violation of causality tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons to an alternate stable state where no physical tachyons exist once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared.42 this is a special case of the general rule where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a complex mass with the real part being their mass in the usual sense and the imaginary part being the decay rate in natural units.42 however in quantum field theory a particle a one-particle state is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time i.e. an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian an unstable particle is a state which is only approximately constant over time if it exists long enough to be measured it can be formally described as having a complex mass with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part if both parts are of the same magnitude this is interpreted as a resonance appearing in a scattering process rather than a particle as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process in the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it where p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest mass should still apply along with the formula for the total energy of a particle exotic matter and negative massedit the negative mass exists in the model to describe dark energy phantom energy and radiation in negative-index metamaterial in a unified way.43 in this way the negative mass is associated with negative momentum negative pressure negative kinetic energy and ftl faster-than-light see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal

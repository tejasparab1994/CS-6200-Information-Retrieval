list of category 5 pacific hurricanes  contents  statisticsedit category 5 pacific hurricanesedit the minimum central pressure of these storms is for the most part estimated from satellite imagery using the dvorak technique in the case of kenna6 ava7 and patricia the central pressure was measured by hurricane hunter aircraft flying into the storm.4 because of the estimation of central pressures it is possible that other storms more intense than these have formed.8 the reason for estimating the pressure in lieu of direct measurements is the fact that most of these storms did not threaten land.9 as kenna and patricia were threatening land their pressures were measured by hurricane hunters using dropsondes.6 while hurricane ava never threatened land4 it too was flown into by hurricane hunters to test equipment and conduct research.7 climatologyedit landfallsedit in addition to these three systems hurricanes john linda and ioke all threatened land for a while john and ioke had minimal impact on johnston atoll and john caused heavy surf in hawaii.12 linda was briefly forecast to approach southern california and it passed close to socorro island near peak intensity.1117 the reason for the lack of landfalls is that tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west.18 in the atlantic this sends hurricanes towards north america in the eastern pacific this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear hawaii the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern pacific is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

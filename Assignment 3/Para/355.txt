mechanisms that cause the oscillation remain under study the extremes of this climate pattern's oscillations cause extreme weather such as floods and droughts in many regions of the world developing countries dependent upon agriculture and fishing particularly those bordering the pacific ocean are the most affected  contents  conceptedit walker circulationedit the walker circulation is caused by the pressure gradient force that results from a high pressure system over the eastern pacific ocean and a low pressure system over indonesia the walker circulations of the tropical indian pacific and atlantic basins result in westerly surface winds in northern summer in the first basin and easterly winds in the second and third basins as a result the temperature structure of the three oceans display dramatic asymmetries the equatorial pacific and atlantic both have cool surface temperatures in northern summer in the east while cooler surface temperatures prevail only in the western indian ocean.7 these changes in surface temperature reflect changes in the depth of the thermocline.8 changes in the walker circulation with time occur in conjunction with changes in surface temperature some of these changes are forced externally such as the seasonal shift of the sun into the northern hemisphere in summer other changes appear to be the result of coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback in which for example easterly winds cause the sea surface temperature to fall in the east enhancing the zonal heat contrast and hence intensifying easterly winds across the basin these anomalous easterlies induce more equatorial upwelling and raise the thermocline in the east amplifying the initial cooling by the southerlies this coupled ocean-atmosphere feedback was originally proposed by bjerknes from an oceanographic point of view the equatorial cold tongue is caused by easterly winds were the earth climate symmetric about the equator cross-equatorial wind would vanish and the cold tongue would be much weaker and have a very different zonal structure than is observed today.9 sea surface temperature oscillationedit neutral phaseedit warm phaseedit cold phaseedit transitional phasesedit southern oscillationedit although the southern oscillation index has a long station record going back to the 1800s its reliability is limited due to the presence of both darwin and tahiti well south of the equator resulting in the surface air pressure at both locations being less directly related to enso.31 to overcome this question a new index was created being named equatorial southern oscillation index eqsoi.3132 to generate this index data two new regions centered on the equator were delimited to create a new index the western one is located over indonesia and the eastern one is located over equatorial pacific close to the south american coast.31 however data on eqsoi goes back only to 1949.31 impactsedit on precipitationedit on tehuantepecersedit on global warmingedit on coral bleachingedit following the el nino event in 1997  1998 the largest recorded to date69 the pacific marine environmental laboratory attributes the first large-scale water bleaching event to the warming waters.70 this process called reef symbiosis71 results from warming ocean water temperatures on hurricanesedit diversityedit paleoclimate recordsedit different modes of enso-like events have been registered in paleoclimatic archives showing different triggering methods feedbacks and environmental responses to the geological atmospheric and oceanographic characteristics of the time these paleorecords can be used to provide a qualitative basis for conservation practices.93 pallcacocha lake ecuador  sediment core referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

enthalpy more technically it includes the internal energy which is the energy required to create a system and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.2 enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy pressure and volume it is an extensive quantity the unit of measurement for enthalpy in the international system of units si is the joule but other historical conventional units are still in use such as the british thermal unit and the calorie enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical biological and physical measurements at constant pressure because it simplifies the description of energy transfer at constant pressure the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work enthalpy of ideal gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure unlike entropy and gibbs energy real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses  contents  originsedit the earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 18755 when josiah willard gibbs introduced a heat function for constant pressure however gibbs did not use the word enthalpy in his writings.note 1 the actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by j p dalton according to that publication heike kamerlingh onnes actually coined the word.6 over the years scientists used many different symbols to denote enthalpy in 1922 alfred w porter proposed the symbol h as a standard7 thus finalizing the terminology still in use today formal definitionedit the enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as1213 where where the label k refers to the various subsystems in case of continuously varying p t or composition the summation becomes an integral the enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function hsp of the entropy s and the pressure p and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows we start from the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems for an infinitesimal process adding dpv to both sides of this expression gives or so other expressionsedit the above expression of dh in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers however there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:12:8814 with this expression one can in principle determine the enthalpy if cp and v are known as functions of p and t in a more general form the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the chemical potential and the number of particles of various types the differential statement for dh then becomes physical interpretationedit the u term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system and the pv term as the energy that would be required to make room for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant when a system for example n moles of a gas of volume v at pressure p and temperature t is created or brought to its present state from absolute zero energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy u plus pv where pv is the work done in pushing against the ambient atmospheric pressure for a heat engine a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the pressure-volume work done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:17 where the work w done by the engine is relationship to heatedit or from this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added heat applicationsedit in thermodynamics one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from nothingness the mechanical work required pv differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the thermodynamic system for a simple system with a constant number of particles the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.19 heat of reactionedit the total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly the enthalpy change of a system is measured instead enthalpy change is defined by the following equation where specific enthalpyedit enthalpy changesedit an enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction it is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed i.e the enthalpy of the products and the initial enthalpy of the system i.e the reactants these processes are reversiblewhy? and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change a common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy of formation which has been determined for a large number of substances enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works such as the crc handbook of chemistry and physics the following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics when used in these recognized terms the qualifier change is usually dropped and the property is simply termed enthalpy of 'process' since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters or standard conditions including for such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term standard e.g standard enthalpy of formation chemical properties physical properties open systemsedit in thermodynamic open systems matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries the first law of thermodynamics for open systems states the increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system where uin is the average internal energy entering the system and uout is the average internal energy leaving the system the region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a control volume and it may or may not correspond to physical walls if we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid there are then two types of work performed flow work described above which is performed on the fluid this is also often called pv work and shaft work which may be performed on some mechanical device these two types of work are expressed in the equation substitution into the equation above for the control volume cv yields the definition of enthalpy h permits us to use this thermodynamic potential to account for both internal energy and pv work in fluids for open systems if we allow also the system boundary to move e.g due to moving pistons we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.21 in terms of time derivatives it reads note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet.clarification needed otherwise it has to be included in the enthalpy balance during steady-state operation of a device see turbine pump and engine the average du/dt may be set equal to zero this yields a useful expression for the average power generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions where the angle brackets denote time averages the technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems as formulated above diagramsedit some basic applicationsedit the points a through h in the figure play a role in the discussion in this section throttlingedit one of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process also known as joule-thomson expansion it concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance valve porous plug or any other type of flow resistance as shown in the figure this process is very important since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator it is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers for a steady state flow regime the enthalpy of the system dotted rectangle has to be constant hence since the mass flow is constant the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same compressorsedit the minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible in that case the second law of thermodynamics for open systems gives eliminating q gives for the minimal power the relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

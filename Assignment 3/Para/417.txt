list of the most intense tropical cyclones tropical cyclone intensity is a complex topic winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds however variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult in addition other impacts like rainfall storm surge area of wind damages and tornadoes can be significant variations in storms with similar wind speeds pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because measurements is easier to measure and consistent tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on earth however although there is strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different.1  contents  north atlantic oceanedit the most intense storm in the north atlantic by lowest pressure was hurricane wilma the strongest storm by 1-minute sustained winds was hurricane allen eastern pacific oceanedit western north pacific oceanedit the most intense storm by lowest pressure and peak 10-minute sustained winds was typhoon tip which was also the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded north indian oceanedit south-west indian oceanedit the most intense tropical cyclone in the south-west indian ocean is cyclone gafilo by 10-minute sustained wind speed the strongest tropical cyclone in the south-west indian ocean is cyclone fantala australian regionedit the most intense tropical cyclones in the australian region are cyclone gwenda and cyclone inigo by 10-minute sustained wind speed the strongest are cyclone orson and cyclone monica south pacific oceanedit storms with an intensity of 920 hpa 27.17 inhg or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985.6 south atlantic oceanedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

tropical cyclone scales tropical cyclones are officially ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basins they are located in only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones but some alternative scales also exist such as accumulated cyclone energy the power dissipation index the integrated kinetic energy index and the hurricane severity index the india meteorological department's scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the north indian ocean and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds tropical cyclones that develop in the southern hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems within the australian or south pacific tropical cyclone basins the scale used to classify systems in the south-west indian ocean and is adapted by meteo france for use in various french territories including new caledonia and french polynesia  contents  backgroundedit atlantic eastern and central pacificedit western pacificedit north indian oceanedit south-western indian oceanedit  australia and fijiedit alternative scalesedit there are other scales that are not officially used by any of the regional specialized meteorological centres or the tropical cyclone warning centres however they are used by other organizations such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration an example of such scale is the integrated kinetic energy index which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge it works on a scale that ranges from one to six with six having the highest destructive potential.20 accumulated cyclone energy ace is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons.21 it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm wind speed 35 knots or higher at six-hour intervals.21 the numbers are usually divided by 10000 to make them more manageable the unit of ace is 104 kn2 and for use as an index the unit is assumed.21 as well as being squared for ace wind speed can also be cubed which is referred to as the power dissipation index pdi.22 the hurricane severity index hsi is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields.23 the hsi is a 0 to 50 point scale allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size.23 points are awarded on a sliding scale with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.23 comparisons across basinsedit the terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another below is a summary of the classifications used by the official warning centres worldwide see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

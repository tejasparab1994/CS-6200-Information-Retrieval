the origin of fire island's name is not certain it is believed its native american name was sictem hackey which translated to land of the secatogues the secatogues were a tribe in the area of the current town of islip it was part of what was also called the seal islands.6 the name of fire island first appeared on a deed in 1789.7 historian richard bayles suggested that the name derives from a misinterpretation or corruption of the dutch word vijf five or in another version vier four referring to the number of islands near the fire island inlet.8 at times histories have referred to it in the plural as fire islands because of the inlet breaks other versions say the island derived its name from fires built on the sea's edge by native americans or by pirates to lure unsuspecting ships into the sandbars some say it is how portions of the island look to be on fire from sea in autumn yet another version says it comes from the rash caused by poison ivy on the island.4 while the western portion of the island was referred to as fire island for many years the eastern portion was referred to as great south beach until 1920 when widespread development caused the whole land mass to be called fire island.7 historyedit settlementedit william tangier smith held title to the entire island in the 17th century under a royal patent from thomas dongan the remnants of smith's manor of st

distance are a challenge to the public safety community because there are no roads on inhabited fire island fire department vehicles are heavily modified four-wheel drive with suspension lifts large diameter off-road tires and recovery equipment which allow them to traverse the sometimes washed-out loose sand until 1986 there was no ambulance service on fire island40 prompting the village of

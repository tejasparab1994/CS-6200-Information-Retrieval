associated with poor education and the lower classes9 as opposed to the official culture and higher education of the upper classes.1011 the stress in the distinction from official culture became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century12need quotation to verify a usage that became established by the interbellum period.13need quotation to verify from the end of world war ii following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of mass culture media culture image culture consumer culture and culture for mass consumption.14 social and cultural changes in the united states were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries the abbreviated form pop for popular as in pop music dates from the late 1950s.15 although terms pop and popular are in some cases used interchangeably and their meaning partially overlap the term pop is narrower pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal while popular refers to what has gained popularity regardless of its style.1617 according to author john storey there are six definitions of popular culture.18 the quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much high culture e.g. television dramatizations of jane austen is also popular. pop culture is also defined as the culture that is left over when we have

revolution studies of shakespeare by weimann barber or bristol for example locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in renaissance popular culture while contemporary practitioners like dario fo and john mcgrath use popular culture in its gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions the commedia dell'arte for example.2021need quotation to

word of mouth rather than via mass media e.g in the form of jokes or urban legend with the widespread use of the internet from the 1990s the distinction between mass media and word-of-mouth has become blurred although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subculture item sold moreover beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by word-of-mouth and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolves entertainmentedit television

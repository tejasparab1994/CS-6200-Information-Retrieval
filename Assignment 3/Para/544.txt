orchestra pit to the first mezzanine it is a hurricane to film your eyes with spin-drift to beat at your ears with its thunder to clutch at your heart and send your diaphragm vaulting over your floating rib into the region just south of your tonsils.2 he complimented the performances of all of the principal actors with the exception of hall whose terangi was described as a competent tarzan.2

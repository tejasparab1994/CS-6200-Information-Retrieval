west virginia west virginia became a state following the wheeling conventions of 1861 after the american civil war had begun delegates from some unionist counties of northwestern virginia decided to break away from virginia although they included many secessionist counties in the new state.12 west virginia was admitted to the union on june 20 1863 and was a key border state during the war west virginia was the only state to form by separating from a confederate state the first to separate from any state since maine separated from massachusetts and was one of two states admitted to the union during the american civil war the other being nevada while a portion of its residents held slaves most of the residents were yeomen farmers and the delegates provided for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state constitution the state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills its historically significant logging and coal mining industries and its political and labor history it is one of the most densely karstic areas in the world making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research.not verified in body the karst lands contribute to much of the state's cool trout

romney the artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of village societies they had a tribal trade system culture that crafted cold-worked copper pieces in the 1670s during the beaver wars the powerful iroquois five allied nations based in present-day new york and pennsylvania drove out other american indian tribes from the region in order to reserve the upper ohio valley as a hunting ground siouan language tribes such as the moneton had previously been recorded in the area a century later the area now identified as west virginia was contested territory among anglo-americans as well with the colonies of pennsylvania and virginia claiming territorial rights under their colonial charters to this area before the american revolutionary war some speculative land companies such as the vandalia company14 and later the ohio company and indiana company tried to legitimize their claims to land in parts of west virginia and kentucky but failed with the federal settlement of the pennsylvania and virginia border dispute which resulted in the creation of kentucky kentuckians were satisfied ... and the inhabitants of a large part of west virginia were grateful.15 the crown considered the area of west virginia to be part of the british virginia colony from 1607 to 1776 the united states considered this area to be the western part of the state of virginia which was commonly referred as trans-allegheny virginia from 1776 to 1863 before the formation of west virginia its residents were discontented for years with their position in virginia as the government was dominated by the planter elite of the tidewater and piedmont areas the legislature had electoral malapportionment based on the counting of slaves toward regional populations and the western white residents were underrepresented in the state legislature more subsistence and yeoman farmers lived in the west and they were generally less supportive of slavery although many counties were divided on their support the residents of this area became more sharply divided after the planter elite of eastern virginia voted to secede from the union during the civil war residents of the western and northern counties set up a separate government under francis pierpont in 1861 which they called the restored government most voted to separate from virginia and the new state was admitted to the union in 1863 in 1864 a state constitutional convention drafted a constitution which was ratified by the legislature without putting it to popular vote west virginia abolished slavery by a gradual process and temporarily disenfranchised men who had held confederate office or fought for the confederacy west virginia's history has been profoundly affected by its mountainous terrain numerous and vast river valleys and rich natural resources these were all factors driving its economy and the lifestyles of its residents who tended to live in many small relatively isolated communities in the mountain valleys geography continues to be important to the state prehistoryedit maize corn did not make a substantial contribution to the diet until after 1150 bp to quote mills osu 2003full citation needed eventually tribal villages began depending on corn to feed their turkey flocks as kanawha fort ancients practiced bird husbandry the local indians made corn bread and a flat rye bread called banick as they emerged from the protohistoric era a horizon extending from a little before the early 18th century is sometimes called the acculturating fireside cabin culture trading posts were established by european traders along the potomac and james rivers tribes which inhabited west virginia as of the 16th century were the calicua 17 in the north the susquehannock in the area immediately south of

william berkeley of the virginia colony sent a party from fort henry led by thomas batts and robert fallam to survey this territory they were the first europeans recorded as discovering kanawha falls some sources state that governor alexander spotswood's 1716 knights of the golden horseshoe expedition for which the state's golden horseshoe competition for 8th graders was named had penetrated as far as pendleton county however modern historians interpret the original accounts of the excursion as suggesting that none of the expedition's horsemen ventured much farther west of the blue ridge mountains than harrisonburg virginia john van metre an indian trader penetrated into the northern portion in 1725 the same year german settlers from pennsylvania founded new mecklenburg the present shepherdstown on the potomac river and others followed king charles ii of england in 1661 granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the potomac and rappahannock rivers known as the northern neck thomas fairfax 6th lord fairfax of cameron ultimately took possession of this grant and in 1746 a stone was erected at the source of the north branch potomac river to mark the western limit of his grant a considerable part of this land was surveyed by the young george washington between 1748 and 1751 the diary kept by washington recorded that there were already many squatters largely of german origin along the south branch potomac river christopher gist a surveyor in the employ of the first ohio company which was composed chiefly of virginians explored the country along the ohio river north of the mouth of the kanawha river between 1751 and 1752 the company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name vandalia many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750 though they were hindered by native american resistance few native americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state but the region was a common hunting ground crossed by many trails during the french and indian war the north american front of the seven years war in europe indian allies of the french nearly destroyed the scattered british settlements trans-allegheny virginiaedit social conditions in western virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state the population was not homogeneous as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of pennsylvania and included germans protestant scotch-irish and settlers from the states farther north counties in the east and south were settled mostly by east virginians during the american revolution the movement to create a state beyond the alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of westsylvania was presented to congress on the grounds that the mountains presented an almost impassable barrier to the east the rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable and time only increased the social political economic and cultural differences see tuckahoe-cohee between the two sections of virginia.citation needed a convention that met in 1829 to form a new constitution for virginia against the protest of the counties beyond the mountains required a property qualification for suffrage this effectively disenfranchised some of the poorer yeoman farmers in addition it gave the slave-holding counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population in apportioning the state's representation in the u.s house of representatives as a result every county beyond the alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution which nevertheless passed because of eastern support the eastern planter elite dominated the legislature and saw to their own interests.citation needed given these differences many in the west had long contemplated a separate state in particular men such as lawyer francis h pierpont from fairmont had long chafed under the political domination of the tidewater and piedmont slave-holders in addition to differences over the abolition of slavery he and allies felt the virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west such as turnpikes and railroads.20 separation from virginiaedit west virginia was the only state in the union to separate from a confederate state virginia during the american civil war.22 in richmond on april 17 1861 the virginia secession convention of 1861 voted to secede from the union but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner which ultimately became west virginia only voted 17 in favor of the ordinance of secession and 30 voted against23 with 2 abstentions.24 almost immediately after that vote a mass meeting at clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in wheeling on may 13 1861 when this first wheeling convention met 425 delegates from 25 counties were present though more than one-third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area25 but soon there was a division of sentiment some delegates led by john s carlile favored the immediate formation of a new state while others led by waitman willey argued that as virginia's secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum as happened on may 23 such action would constitute revolution against the united states.26 the convention decided that if virginians adopted the secession ordinance of which there was little doubt another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in wheeling in june 1861 on may 23 1861 secession was ratified by a large majority in virginia as a whole but in the western counties 34677 voted against and 19121 voted for the ordinance.27 the second wheeling convention had recessed until august 6 then reassembled on august 20 and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable at the october 24 1861 election 18408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against the election results were questioned since the union army then occupied the area and union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent confederate sympathizers from voting.31 this was also election day for local offices and elections were also held in camps of confederate soldiers who elected rival state officials such as robert e cowan most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the northern panhandle.32 over 50000 votes had been cast on the ordinance of secession yet the vote on statehood garnered little more than 19000.33 in ohio county home to wheeling only about one-quarter of the registered voters cast votes.34 in most of what would become west virginia there was no vote at all since as two-thirds of the territory of west virginia had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to richmond votes recorded from pro-secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these counties.35 despite that controversy delegates including many methodist ministers met to write a new constitution for the new state beginning on november 26 1861 during that constitutional convention a mr lamb of ohio county and a mr carskadon claimed that in hampshire county out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state the rest were cast illegally by union soldiers.36 one of the key figures was rev gordon battelle who also represented ohio county and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools as well as to limit movement of slaves into the new state and to gradually abolish slavery the education proposal succeeded but the convention tabled the slavery proposals before finishing its work on february 18 1862 the new constitution was more closely modeled on that of ohio than of virginia adopting a township model of government rather than the courthouse cliques of virginia which carlile criticized and a compromise demanded by the kanawha region charleston lawyers benjamin smith and brown allowed counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railroads or other improvement organizations.37 the resulting instrument was ratified 18162 for and 514 against on april 11 1862 on may 13 1862 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state an application for admission to the union was made to congress introduced by senator waitman willey of the restored government of virginia however sen carlile sought to sabotage the bill first trying to expand the new state's boundaries to include the shenandoah valley and then to defeat the willey amendment at home.38 on december 31 1862 an enabling act was approved by president abraham lincoln admitting west virginia on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution as rev battelle had urged in the wheeling intelligencer and also written to lincoln while many felt that west virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional lincoln issued his opinion on the admission of west virginia finding that the body which consents to the admission of west virginia is the legislature of virginia and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient.39 the convention was reconvened on february 12 1863 and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met the revised constitution was adopted on march 26 1863 and on april 20 1863 president lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state 60 days later on june 20 1863 meanwhile officers for the new state were chosen while gov pierpont moved his pro-union virginia capital to union-occupied alexandria where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all of the remaining virginia counties within the federal lines the question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was later brought before the supreme court of the united states in the following manner berkeley and jefferson counties lying on the potomac east of the mountains in 1863 with the consent of the reorganized government of virginia voted in favor of annexation to west virginia many voters of the strongly pro-secessionist counties were absent in the confederate army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer when they returned the virginia general assembly repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against west virginia asking the court to declare the counties a part of virginia which would have declared west virginia's admission as a state unconstitutional meanwhile on march 10 1866 congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer the supreme court decided in favor of west virginia in 1870.40 during the civil war union general george b mcclellan's forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861 culminating at the battle of rich mountain and union control was never again seriously threatened despite an attempt by robert e lee in the same year in 1863 general john d imboden with 5000 confederates raided a considerable portion of the state and burned pierpont's library although senator willey escaped their grasp bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended the eastern panhandle counties were more affected by the war with military control of the area repeatedly changing hands development of natural resourcesedit after reconstruction the new 35th state benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other single economic activity saltpeter caves had been employed throughout appalachia for munitions the border between west virginia and virginia includes the saltpeter trail a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were rendered and sold to the government the trail stretched from pendleton county to the western terminus of the route in the town of union monroe county nearly half of these caves are on the west virginia side including organ cave and haynes cave in the late 18th-century saltpeter miners in haynes cave found large animal bones in the deposits these were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier colonel john stuart to thomas jefferson the bones were named megalonyx jeffersonii or great-claw and became known as jefferson's three-toed sloth it was declared the official state fossil of west virginia in 2008 the west virginia official state rock is bituminous coal44 and the official state gemstone is silicified mississippian fossil lithostrotionella coral.45 the limestone also produced a useful quarry industry usually small and softer high-calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime this lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes for many years a specific portion of the c  o railroad carried limestone rock to clifton forge virginia as an industrial flux salt mining had been underway since the 18th century though it had largely played out by the time of the american civil war when the red salt of kanawha county was a valued commodity of first confederate and later union forces in years following more sophisticated mining methods would restore west virginia's role as a major producer of salt however in the second half of the 19th century there was an even greater treasure not yet developed bituminous coal it would fuel much of the industrial revolution in the u.s and the steamships of many of the world's navies the residents both native americans and early european settlers had long known of the underlying coal and that it could be used for heating and fuel however for a long time very small personal mines were the only practical development after the war with the new railroads came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding u.s and export markets as the anthracite mines of northwestern new jersey and pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period investors and industrialists focused new interest in west virginia geologists such as dr david t ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projects the completion of the chesapeake and ohio railway c&o across the state to the new city of huntington on the ohio river in 1872 opened access to the new river coal field soon the c&o was building its huge coal pier at newport news virginia on the large harbor of hampton roads in 1881 the new philadelphia-based owners of the former atlantic mississippi and ohio railroad am&o which stretched across virginia's southern tier from norfolk had sights clearly set on the mountain state where the owners had large land holdings their railroad was renamed norfolk and western n&w and a new railroad city was developed at roanoke to handle planned expansion after its new president frederick j kimball and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam which kimball's wife named pocahontas the n&w redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it soon the n&w was also shipping from new coal piers at hampton roads in 1889 in the southern part of the state along the norfolk and western rail lines the important coal center of bluefield west virginia was founded the capital of the pocahontas coalfield this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades it shares a sister city with the same name bluefield in virginia in the northern portion of the state and elsewhere the older baltimore and ohio railroad b&o and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities the b&o developed coal piers in baltimore and at several points on the great lakes other significant rail carriers of coal were the western maryland railway wm southern railway sou and the louisville and nashville railroad l&n particularly notable was a latecomer the virginian railway vgn by 1900 only a large area of the most rugged terrain of southern west virginia was any distance from the existing railroads and mining activity within this area west of the new river coalfield in raleigh and wyoming counties lay the winding gulf coalfield later promoted as the billion dollar coalfield. although the deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme in secret collusion each declined to negotiate favorable rates with page nor did they offer to purchase his railroad as they had many other short-lines however if the c&o and n&w presidents thought they could thus kill the page project they were to be proved mistaken one of the silent partner investors page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist henry huttleston rogers a principal in john d rockefeller's standard oil trust and an old hand at developing natural resources and transportation a master at competitive warfare henry rogers did not like to lose in his endeavors and also had deep pockets instead of giving up page and rogers quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across virginia using rogers private fortune to finance the $40-million cost when the renamed virginian railway vgn was completed in 1909 no fewer than three railroads were shipping ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from hampton roads west virginia coal was also under high demand at great lakes ports the vgn and the n&w ultimately became parts of the modern norfolk southern system and the vgn's well-engineered 21st-century tracks continue to offer a favorable gradient to hampton roads as coal mining and related work became major employment activities in the state there was considerable labor strife as working conditions safety issues and economic concerns arose even in the 21st century mining safety and ecological concerns is still challenging to the state whose coal continues to power electrical generating plants in many other states coal is not the only valuable mineral found in west virginia as the state was the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34.48 carat 6.896 g jones diamond geographyedit geology and terrainedit other areas under protection and management include most of west virginia lies within the appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the appalachian-blue ridge forests the native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak chestnut maple beech and white pine with willow and american sycamore along the state's waterways many of the areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty a fact that is appreciated by native west virginians who refer to their home as almost heaven

states census bureau estimates that the population of west virginia was 1831102 on july 1 2016 a 1.2 decrease since the 2010 united states census.54 the center of population of west virginia is located in braxton county in the town of gassaway.55 at the 2010 census the racial composition of the state's population was in the same year 1.2 of west virginia's population was of hispanic latino or spanish origin they may be of any race as of 2012 west virginia has an estimated population of 1855413 which is an increase of 49 or 0.0% from the prior year and an increase of 2414 or 0.13% since the year 2000 this includes a natural decrease since the last census of 3296 people that is 108292 births minus 111588 deaths and an increase from net migration of 14209 people into the state west virginia is the least populous southeastern state immigration from outside the united states resulted in a net increase of 3691 people and migration within the country produced a net increase of 10518 people only 1.1 of the state's residents were foreign-born placing west virginia last among the 50 states in that statistic it also has the lowest percentage of residents that speak a language other than english in the home 2.7% the five largest ancestry groups in west virginia are german 18.9% irish 15.1% american 12.9% english 11.8% and italian 4.7%5960 in the 2000 census people who identified their ethnicity as simply american made up 18.7 of the population.61 the majority of these people are of scots-irish ancestry or of english descent.citation needed large numbers of people of german ancestry are present in the northeastern counties of the state people of english ancestry are present throughout the entire state many west virginians who self-identify as irish are actually scots-irish protestants 5.6 of west virginia's population were reported as under 5 22.3 under 18 and 15.3 were 65 or older females made up approximately 51.4 of the population there were 20928 births

population.62 the state's northern panhandle and north-central region feel an affinity for pittsburgh pennsylvania also those in the eastern panhandle feel a connection with the washington d.c suburbs in maryland and virginia and southern west virginians often consider themselves southerners finally the towns and farms along the mid-ohio river which forms most of the state's western border have an appearance and culture somewhat resembling the midwest.63 birth dataedit note births in table don't add up because hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race giving a higher overall number religionedit several surveys have been made in recent years in 2008 by the american religion identity survey69 in 2010 by the pew forum on religion and public life.70 the pew survey results admit to a 6.5 margin of error plus or minus while the aris survey states that estimates are subject to larger sampling errors in states with small populations. a characteristic of religion in appalachian communities is the abundance of independent non-affiliated churches which remain unnoted and uncounted in any census of church life in the united states. this sometimes leads to the belief that these communities are unchurched.71 the largest denomination as of 2010 was the united methodist church with 136000 members in 1200 congregations the second largest protestant church was the american baptist churches usa with 88000 members and 381 congregations the southern baptist church had 44000 members and 232 congregations the churches of christ had 22000 members and 287

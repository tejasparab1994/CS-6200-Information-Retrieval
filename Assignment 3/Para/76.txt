climate atmospheric physicsatmospheric dynamics category climate categoryclimate change category climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time.12 it is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature humidity atmospheric pressure wind precipitation atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time climate differs from weather in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region a region's climate is generated by the climate system which has five components atmosphere hydrosphere cryosphere lithosphere and biosphere.3  contents  definitionedit the world meteorological organization wmo describes climate normals as reference points used by climatologists to compare current climatological trends to that of the past or what is considered 'normal' a normal is defined as the arithmetic average of a climate element e.g temperature over a 30-year period a 30 year period is used as it is long enough to filter out any interannual variation or anomalies but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends.10 the wmo originated from the international meteorological organization which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929 at its 1934 wiesbaden meeting the technical commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals in 1982 the wmo agreed to update climate normals and these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data from 1 january 1961 to 31 december 1990.11 climate classificationedit bergeron and spatial synopticedit the simplest classification is that involving air masses the bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.18 air mass classification involves three letters the first letter describes its moisture properties with c used for continental air masses dry and m for maritime air masses moist the second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region t for tropical p for polar a for arctic or antarctic m for monsoon e for equatorial and s for superior air dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere the third letter is used to designate the stability of the atmosphere if the air mass is colder than the ground below it it is labeled k if the air mass is warmer than the ground below it it is labeled w.19 while air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.20 based upon the bergeron classification scheme is the spatial synoptic classification system ssc there are six categories within the ssc scheme dry polar similar to continental polar dry moderate similar to maritime superior dry tropical similar to continental tropical moist polar similar to maritime polar moist moderate a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical and moist tropical similar to maritime tropical maritime monsoon or maritime equatorial.21 a monsoon is a seasonal prevailing wind which lasts for several months ushering in a region's rainy season.23 regions within north america south america sub-saharan africa australia and east asia are monsoon regimes.24 the humid subtropical climate zone where winter rainfall and sometimes snowfall is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones.29 humid subtropical climates lie on the east side of continents roughly between latitudes 20 and 40 degrees away from the equator.30 an oceanic climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents and in southeastern australia and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.32 the mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the mediterranean basin parts of western north america parts of western and south australia in southwestern south africa and in parts of central chile the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool wet winters.33 tundra occurs in the far northern hemisphere north of the taiga belt including vast areas of northern russia and canada.37 a polar ice cap or polar ice sheet is a high-latitude region of a planet or moon that is covered in ice ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar radiation from the sun than equatorial regions resulting in lower surface temperatures.38 thornthwaiteedit devised by the american climatologist and geographer c w thornthwaite this climate classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration.40 it monitors the portion of total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area.41 it uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature average rainfall and average vegetation type.42 the lower the value of the index in any given area the drier the area is recordedit modernedit details of the modern climate record are known through the taking of measurements from such weather instruments as thermometers barometers and anemometers during the past few centuries the instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale their known error their immediate environment and their exposure have changed over the years which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past.50 paleoclimatologyedit paleoclimatology is the study of past climate over a great period of the earth's history it uses evidence from ice sheets tree rings sediments coral and rocks to determine the past state of the climate it demonstrates periods of stability and periods of change and can indicate whether changes follow patterns such as regular cycles.51 climate changeedit climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time it reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years these changes can be caused by processes internal to the earth external forces e.g variations in sunlight intensity or more recently human activities.5253 in recent usage especially in the context of environmental policy the term climate change often refers only to changes in modern climate including the rise in average surface temperature known as global warming in some cases the term is also used with a presumption of human causation as in the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the unfccc uses climate variability for non-human caused variations.55 earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past including four major ice ages these consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal separated by interglacial periods the accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo reflecting more of the sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature increases in greenhouse gases such as by volcanic activity can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the continents variations in the earth's orbit changes in the solar output and volcanism.56 climate modelsedit climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere57 oceans land surface and ice they are used for a variety of purposes from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate all climate models balance or very nearly balance incoming energy as short wave including visible electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave infrared electromagnetic radiation from the earth any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth the most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere primarily carbon dioxide see greenhouse gas these models predict an upward trend in the global mean surface temperature with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere models can range from relatively simple to quite complex climate forecasting is a way by some scientists are using to predict climate change in 1997 the prediction division of the international research institute for climate and society at columbia university began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis to produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.59 see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation

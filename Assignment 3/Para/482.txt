anticyclonic storm an anticyclonic storm is a weather storm where winds around the storm flow in the direction opposite to that of the flow about a region of low pressure descriptionedit in the northern hemisphere anticyclonic storms involve clockwise wind flow in the southern hemisphere they involve counterclockwise wind flow anticyclonic storms usually form around high-pressure systems these do not contradict the coriolis effect it predicts such anticyclonic flow about high-pressure regions anticyclonic storms as high-pressure systems usually accompany cold weather and are frequently a factor in large snowstorms jupiter's great red spot is a well-known extraterrestrial example of an anticyclonic system anticyclonic tornadoes often occur;1 while tornadoes vortices are low-pressure regions this occurs because tornadoes occur on a small enough scale such that the coriolis effect is negligible referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

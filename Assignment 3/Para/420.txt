north indian ocean tropical cyclone in the indian ocean north of the equator tropical cyclones can form throughout the year on either side of india on the east side is the bay of bengal and on the west side is the arabian sea  contents  sub-basinsedit the bay of bengal located in the northeast of the indian ocean is responsible for the formation of some of the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclones in the world the basin is abbreviated bob by the india meteorological department imd the official regional specialized meteorological center of the basin the bay of bengal's coast is shared among india bangladesh myanmar sri lanka and western part of thailand the strongest storm in the bay was the 1999 odisha cyclone as the remnants impact tibet and yunnan sometimes the national meteorological center of cma also issues full advisories to cyclonic storms in this basin.1 the arabian sea is a sea located in the northwest of the indian ocean tropical cyclones in the basin are abbreviated arb by the india meteorological department imd the official regional specialized meteorological centre rsmc of the basin the arabian sea's coast is shared among india yemen oman iran pakistan sri lanka maldives and somalia.2 monsoons are characteristic of the arabian sea and responsible for the yearly cycling of its waters in summer strong winds blow from the southwest to the northeast bringing rain to the indian subcontinent during the winter the winds are milder and blow in the opposite direction from the northeast to the southwest.2 cyclones are rare in the arabian sea but the basin can produce strong tropical cyclones super cyclonic storm gonu was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the basin.34 5 however storms typically do not reach a high intensity in the arabian sea due to the small amount of water dry air coming from the desert of the arabian peninsula and unfavorable wind shear from the monsoon.6 history of the basinedit the systematic scientific studies of tropical systems in the bay of bengal and arabian sea was started during the 19th century by henry piddington.7 piddington utilised meteorological logs of vessels that navigated the seas and published a series of memoirs in the journal of the asiatic society of bengal between 1839 and 1858.7 these memoirs gave accounts and tracks of individual storms in the bay of bengal and the arabian sea.7 during the 2004 post monsoon season the imd started to name tropical cyclones within the basin with the first one named cyclone onil during september 2004.8 water temperatures in the arabian sea are typically warm enough to allow for tropical cyclogenesis year round although strong wind shear from the monsoon trough prevents formation in the summer months and limits intensity other times of the year an increase in air pollution since the 1930s caused a decrease in the wind shear allowing storms to have become stronger since 1979.10 yearsedit deadliest cyclonesedit 11 costliest cyclonesedit most intense tropical cyclonesedit tropical cyclone seasonsedit 1890sedit 1900sedit 1910sedit 1920sedit 1930sedit 1940sedit 1950sedit 1960sedit 1970sedit 1980sedit 1990sedit 2000sedit 2010sedit see alsoedit notesedit a study analyzing the spring season of tropical cyclones in the bay of bengal15 found increases in both premonsoon precipitation and tropical cyclone intensity as a result of enhanced large-scale monsoon circulation after 1979 the deepened monsoon trough in the bay of bengal not only affects cyclone frequency and timing but also acts to direct more cyclones towards myanmar increased anthropogenic aerosols likely contributed to such a regional climate change referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

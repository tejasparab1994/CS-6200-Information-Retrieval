beaufort scale  contents  historyedit the initial scale of thirteen classes zero to twelve did not reference wind speed numbers but related qualitative wind conditions to effects on the sails of a frigate then the main ship of the royal navy from just sufficient to give steerage to that which no canvas sails could withstand.2 the scale was made a standard for ship's log entries on royal navy vessels in the late 1830s and was adapted to non-naval use from the 1850s with scale numbers corresponding to cup anemometer rotations in 1916 to accommodate the growth of steam power the descriptions were changed to how the sea not the sails behaved and extended to land observations rotations to scale numbers were standardized only in 1923 george simpson c.b.e later sir george simpson director of the uk meteorological office was responsible for this and for the addition of the land-based descriptors.1 the measure was slightly altered some decades later to improve its utility for meteorologists today many countries have abandoned the scale and use the metric system based units m/s or km/h insteadcitation needed but the severe weather warnings given to the public are still approximately the same as when using the beaufort scale the beaufort scale was extended in 1946 when forces 13 to 17 were added.3 however forces 13 to 17 were intended to apply only to special cases such as tropical cyclones nowadays the extended scale is only used in taiwan and mainland china which are often affected by typhoons internationally wmo manual on marine meteorological services 2012 edition defined the beaufort scale only up to force 12 and there was no recommendation on the use of the extended scale.4 wind speed on the 1946 beaufort scale is based on the empirical relationship:5 wave heights in the scale are for conditions in the open ocean not along the shore modern scaleedit this scale is also widely used in the netherlands germany11 greece china taiwan hong kong malta and macau although with some differences between them taiwan uses the beaufort scale with the extension to 17 noted above china also switched to this extended version without prior notice on the morning of 15 may 200612 and the extended scale was immediately put to use for typhoon chanchu hong kong and macau retain force 12 as the maximum in the united states winds of force 6 or 7 result in the issuance of a small craft advisory with force 8 or 9 winds bringing about a gale warning force 10 or 11 a storm warning a tropical storm warning being issued instead of the latter two if the winds relate to a tropical cyclone and force 12 a hurricane-force wind warning or hurricane warning if related to a tropical cyclone a set of red warning flags daylight and red warning lights night time is displayed at shore establishments which coincide with the various levels of warning in canada maritime winds forecast to be in the range of 6 to 7 are designated as strong 8 to 9 gale force 10 to 11 storm force 12 hurricane force appropriate wind warnings are issued by environment canada's meteorological service of canada strong wind warning gale force wind warning storm force wind warning and hurricane-force wind warning these designations were standardized nationally in 2008 whereas light wind can refer to 0 to 12 or 0 to 15 knots and moderate wind 12 to 19 or 16 to 19 knots depending on regional custom definition or practice prior to 2008 a strong wind warning would have been referred to as a small craft warning by environment canada similar to us terminology canada and the usa have the great lakes in common. see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

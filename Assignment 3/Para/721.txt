contents  history by the 16th century the earliest time for which there is a historical record major native american groups included the apalachee of the florida panhandle the timucua of northern and central florida the ais of the central atlantic coast the tocobaga of the tampa bay area the calusa of southwest florida and the tequesta of the southeastern coast european arrival the geographical area of florida diminished with the establishment of english settlements to the north and french claims to the west the english attacked st augustine burning the city and its cathedral to the ground several times spain built the castillo de san marcos in 1672 and fort matanzas in 1742 to defend florida's capital city from attacks and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the captaincy general of cuba and the spanish west indies florida attracted numerous africans and african-americans from adjacent british colonies who sought freedom from slavery in 1738 governor manuel de montiano established fort gracia real de santa teresa de mose near st augustine a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the florida militia and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in north america.1718 in 1763 spain traded florida to the kingdom of great britain for control of havana cuba which had been captured by the british during the seven years war it was part of a large expansion of british territory following their victory in the seven years war a large portion of the floridano population left taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to cuba.19 the british soon constructed the king's road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british named cow ford both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.202122 the british divided and consolidated the florida provinces las floridas into east florida and west florida a division the spanish government kept after the brief british period.23 the british government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the french and indian war in order to encourage settlement in order to induce settlers to move to florida reports of its natural wealth were published in england a large number of british settlers who were described as being energetic and of good character moved to florida mostly coming from south carolina georgia and england there was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of bermuda this would be the first permanent english-speaking population in what is now duval county baker county st johns county and nassau county the british built good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber.2425 as a result of these initiatives northeastern florida prospered economically in a way it never did under spanish administration furthermore the british governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the floridas and in the meantime they were with the advice of councils to establish courts this would be the first introduction of much of the english-derived legal system which florida still has today including trial by jury habeas corpus and county-based government.2425 neither east florida nor west florida would send any representatives to philadelphia to draft the declaration of independence florida would remain a loyalist stronghold for the duration of the american revolution.26 spain regained both east and west florida after britain's defeat in the american revolution and the subsequent treaty of versailles in 1783 and continued the provincial divisions until 1821 joining the united states indian removal defense of florida's northern border with the united states was minor during the second spanish period the region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for indian attacks against u.s territories and the u.s pressed spain for reform americans of english descent and americans of scots-irish descent began moving into northern florida from the backwoods of georgia and south carolina though technically not allowed by the spanish authorities and the floridan government they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the united states would continue to immigrate into florida unchecked these migrants mixing with the already present british settlers who had remained in florida since the british period would be the progenitors of the population known as florida crackers.27 these american settlers established a permanent foothold in the area and ignored spanish authorities the british settlers who had remained also resented spanish rule leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called free and independent republic of west florida on september 23 after meetings beginning in june rebels overcame the garrison at baton rouge now in louisiana and unfurled the flag of the new republic a single white star on a blue field this flag would later become known as the bonnie blue flag in 1810 parts of west florida were annexed by proclamation of president james madison who claimed the region as part of the louisiana purchase these parts were incorporated into the newly formed territory of orleans the u.s annexed the mobile district of west florida to the mississippi territory in 1812 spain continued to dispute the area though the united states gradually increased the area it occupied in 1812 a group of settlers from georgia with de facto support from the u.s federal government attempted to overthrow the floridan government in the province of east florida the settlers hoped to convince floridans to join their cause and proclaim independence from spain but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by 1813.28 by the early 1800s indian removal was a significant issue throughout the southeastern u.s and also in florida in 1830 the u.s congress passed the indian removal act and as settlement increased pressure grew on the united states government to remove the indians from florida seminoles harbored runaway blacks known as the black seminoles and clashes between whites and indians grew with the influx of new settlers in 1832 the treaty of payne's landing promised to the seminoles lands west of the mississippi river if they agreed to leave florida many seminole left at this time on march 3 1845 florida became the 27th state to join the united states of america.34 the state was admitted as a slave state and ceased to be a sanctuary for runaway slaves initially its population grew slowly slavery war and disenfranchisement american settlers began to establish cotton plantations in north florida which required numerous laborers which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market by 1860 florida had only 140424 people of whom 44 were enslaved there were fewer than 1000 free african americans before the american civil war.36 the confederal union received little help from florida the 15000 men it offered were generally sent elsewhere the largest engagements in the state were the battle of olustee on february 20 1864 and the battle of natural bridge on march 6 1865 both were confederate victories.38 the war ended in 1865 following the american civil war florida's congressional representation was restored on june 25 1868 albeit forcefully after radical reconstruction and the installation of unelected government officials under the final authority of federal military commanders after the reconstruction period ended in 1876 white democrats regained power in the state legislature in 1885 they created a new constitution followed by statutes through 1889 that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites.citation needed until the mid-20th century florida was the least populous southern state in 1900 its population was only 528542 of whom nearly 44 were african american the same proportion as before the civil war.39 the boll weevil devastated cotton crops forty thousand blacks roughly one-fifth of their 1900 population left the state in the great migration they left due to lynchings and racial violence and for better opportunities.40 disfranchisement for most african americans in the state persisted until the civil rights movement of the 1960s gained federal legislation in 1965 to enforce protection of their constitutional suffrage 20th-century growth historically florida's economy has been based primarily upon agricultural products such as cattle sugar cane citrus fruits tomatoes and strawberries economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to florida and related development of hotels and resort communities combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the florida land boom of the 1920s which brought a brief period of intense land development devastating hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 followed by the great depression brought that period to a halt florida's economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for world war ii in 1939 florida was described as still very largely an empty state.41 subsequently the growing availability of air conditioning the climate and a low cost of living made the state a haven migration from the rust belt and the northeast sharply increased florida's population after 1945 in recent decades more migrants have come for the jobs in a developing economy with a population of more than 18 million according to the 2010 census florida is the most populous state in the southeastern united states and

rarely receives measurable snowfall however on rare occasions a combination of cold moisture and freezing temperatures can result in snowfall in the farthest northern regions frost which is more common than snow sometimes occurs in the panhandle.citation needed florida's nickname is the sunshine state but severe weather is a common occurrence in the state central florida is known as the lightning capital of the united states as it experiences more lightning strikes than anywhere else in the country.57 florida has one of the highest average precipitation levels of any state58 in large part because afternoon thunderstorms are common in much of the state from late spring until early autumn a narrow eastern part of the state including orlando and jacksonville receives between 2400 and 2800 hours of sunshine annually the rest of the state including miami receives between 2800 and 3200 hours annually.59 florida leads the united states in tornadoes per area when including

porous plateau of karst limestone sitting atop bedrock known as the florida platform the largest deposits of potash in the united states are found in florida.81 extended systems of underwater caves sinkholes and springs are found throughout the state and supply most of the water used by residents the limestone is topped with sandy soils deposited as ancient beaches over millions of years as global sea levels rose and fell during the last glacial period lower sea levels and a drier climate revealed a much wider peninsula largely savanna.82 the everglades an enormously wide slow-flowing

presidential candidate in every election except for 1964 the following year congress passed and president lyndon b johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 providing for oversight of state practices and enforcement of constitutional voting rights for african americans and other minorities in order to prevent the discrimination and disenfranchisement that had excluded most of them for decades from the political process from the 1930s through much of the 1960s florida was essentially a one-party state dominated by white conservative democrats who together with other democrats of the solid south exercised considerable control in congress they have gained slightly less federal money from national programs than they have paid in taxes 134 since the 1970s conservative white voters in the state have largely shifted from the democratic to the republican party though the majority of registered voters in florida are democrats 135 it has continued to support republican presidential candidates through the 20th century except in 1976 and 1996 when the democratic nominee was from the south in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections barack obama carried the state as a northern democrat attracting high voter turnout especially among the young independents and minority voters of whom hispanics comprise an increasingly large proportion 2008 marked the first time since 1932 when franklin d roosevelt carried the state that florida was carried by a northern democrat for president the first post-reconstruction era republican elected to congress from florida was william c cramer in 1954 from pinellas county on the gulf coast136 where demographic changes were underway in this period african americans were still disenfranchised by the state's constitution and discriminatory practices in the 19th century they had made up most of the republican party cramer built a different republican party in florida attracting local white conservatives and transplants from northern and midwestern states in 1966 claude r kirk jr was elected as the first post-reconstruction republican governor in an upset election.137 in 1968 edward j gurney also a white conservative was elected as the state's first post-reconstruction republican us senator.138 in 1970 democrats took the governorship and the open us senate seat and maintained dominance for years since the mid-20th century florida has been considered a bellwether voting for 13 successful presidential candidates since 1952 it voted for the loser only three times.139 in 1998 democratic voters dominated areas of the state with a high percentage of racial minorities and transplanted white liberals from the northeastern united states known colloquially as snowbirds.140 south florida and the miami metropolitan area are dominated by both racial minorities and white liberals because of this the area has consistently voted as one of the most democratic areas of the state the daytona beach area is similar demographically and the city of orlando has a large hispanic population which has often favored democrats republicans made up mostly of white conservatives have dominated throughout much of the rest of florida particularly in the more rural and suburban areas this is characteristic of its voter base throughout the deep south.140 the fast-growing i-4 corridor area which runs through central florida and connects the cities of daytona beach orlando and tampa/st petersburg has had a fairly even breakdown of republican and democratic voters the area is often seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the liberal southern portion making it the biggest swing area in the state since the late 20th century the voting results in this area containing 40 of florida voters has often determined who will win the state of florida in presidential elections.141 the democratic party has maintained an edge in voter registration both statewide and in 40 of the 67 counties including miami-dade broward and palm beach counties the state's three most populous.142 elections of 2000 to present reapportionment following the 2010 united states census gave the state

in 2015 the florida supreme court ruled on appeal that the congressional districts had to be redrawn because of the legislature's violation of the fair district amendments to the state constitution passed in 2010 it accepted a new map in early december 2015 the political make-up of congressional and legislative districts has enabled republicans to control the governorship and most statewide elective offices and 17 of the state's 27 seats in the 2012 house of representatives.146 florida has been listed as a swing state in presidential elections since 1950 voting for the losing candidate once in that period of time.147 in 2008 delegates of both the republican florida primary election and democratic florida primary election were stripped of half of their votes when the conventions met in august due to violation of both parties national rules in 2010 more than 63 of state voters approved the initiated amendments 5 and 6 to the state constitution to ensure more fairness in districting these have become known as the fair district amendments as a result of the 2010 united states census florida gained two house of representative seats in 2012.145 the legislature issued revised congressional districts in 2012 which were immediately challenged in court by supporters of the above amendments according to the sentencing project the effect of florida's felony disenfranchisement law is such that in 2014 more than one in ten floridians  and nearly one in four african-american floridians  are were shut out of the polls because of felony convictions although they had completed sentences and parole/probation requirements.154 statutes the state repealed mandatory auto inspection in 1981.155 in 1972 the state made personal injury protection auto insurance

speculators discovered florida and businessmen such as henry plant and henry flagler developed railroad systems which led people to move in drawn by the weather and local economies from then on tourism boomed fueling a cycle of development that overwhelmed a great deal of farmland due to the huge payouts by the insurance industry as a result of the hurricane claims of 2004 homeowners insurance has risen 40 to 60 and deductibles have risen.62 at the end of the third quarter in 2008 florida had the highest mortgage delinquency rate in the u.s. with 7.8 of mortgages delinquent at

veracruz  contents  etymologyedit geographyedit political geographyedit natural geographyedit climateedit ecosystemsedit the northern part of the state as well as the higher mountain areas are convergence zones between lowland evergreen tropical forests and more temperate flora and fauna it is also the northernmost occurrence of subhumid tropical forest in mexico although little of this remains mostly on steep slopes this tropical forest is situated in the northeastern coastal plain and extends into southern tamaulipas state on the east side of the sierra madre oriental the soils here are volcanic and shallow but with rich organic matter species that predominate include mayan breadnut brosimum alicastrum sapodilla manilkara zapota rosadillo celtis monoica bursera simaruba dendropanax arboreus and sideroxylon capiri this ecoregion extends into the central part of the state with vegetation changing to include mahogany swietenia macrophylla sapodilla manilkara zapota

provinces of tochtepec cuetlaxtlan cempoallan quauhtochco jalapa misantla and tlatlauhquitepec the aztecs were interested in the area's vegetation and crops such as cedars fruit cotton cacao corn beans and vanilla however the totonacs chafed under aztec rule with aztec rulers from axayacatl to moctezuma ii having to send soldiers to quell rebellions the huastecs were subjugated more successfully by the aztecs and relegated to the provinces of atlan and tochpan.15 much of totonac and huastec culture have survived the colonial period into the present day much of the reason for this is that the north of veracruz is rugged with thick vegetation and relatively little of the resources the spanish were looking for.15 veracruz is considered to be where the mestizo or mixed european/indigenous race began which is a large part of mexican cultural identity.18 outside of the port in other areas of the province the economy was based on agriculture livestock and commerce in 1720 xalapa organized the first trade fair making it the center for trade between inland mexican goods and those from abroad this would lead to its eventual status as capital of the state.18 independenceedit the french intervened in mexico through veracruz for the first time in the 1838 in what became the pastry war the port was blockaded efforts to defend the country were coordinated from xalapa the port was bombarded but eventually a settlement was reached.18 in 1863 the state was officially named veracruz-llave after the french were expelled the state government was in the port of veracruz in 1878 the capital was transferred to orizaba it was later moved to xalapa in 1885.18 20th century to the presentedit on april 21 1914 an incident involving u.s sailors in tampico led president woodrow wilson to land american troops in veracruz where they remained for six months mexico later responded by severing diplomatic relations.15 economyedit agricultureedit the primary sector of the economy agriculture forestry and fishing has been important since pre-hispanic times and continues to be important both as a source of income as well as culturally the state has abundant rainfall and extremely fertile soils as well as a long coastline and forest containing a wide variety of trees and other plants.1524 livestock raising is an important activity there are over 300000 units of production most of which raise cattle with veracruz being the main beef producer for the country at 14 of the total in addition to beef cattle dairy cattle pigs sheep goats horses domestic fowl and bees are raised.14 agroindustry focuses on the processing of coffee and sugar products with citrus packers holding an important position as well.citation needed natural resourcesedit today the state of veracruz rich in natural resources is an important component of mexico's economy approximately 35 of mexico's water supply is found in veracruz there are a number of metallic and non-metallic mineral mining but the most important resource is oil.15 the mountains contain relatively unexploited deposits of gold silver iron and coal although veracruz is an important source of metals such as iron and copper a great deal of its mining involves non-metallic minerals as sulfur silica feldspar calcium kaolin and marble the state is ranked fourth in the nation for this kind of mining production.1315 however mining only accounts for 1.5 of economic activity for the entire state.15 golden lane oil fieldsedit industry transportation and commerceedit laguna verde nuclear power plant lvnpp in alto lucero veracruz produces about 4.5 of mexico's electrical energy in the industrial sector relatively poor municipios are not catching up to relatively rich ones though the latter are not diverging either a policy of encouraging much more domestic and/or foreign investment is called for if poorer areas are to prosper and the outflow of residents is to stop.33 handcraftsedit cultureedit gastronomyedit the gastronomy of the state is unique in mexico and mixed spanish indigenous and other influences.35 from the pre-hispanic period the cuisine of the state was unique the staple triumvirate of corn beans and squash was supplemented by tropical fruits vanilla beans and an herb called acuyo or hoja santa another important native contribution is seafood which is featured in many dishes such as arroz a la tumbada and caldo de mariscos seafood soup.11 after the conquest and during the colonial period many other spices and ingredients were brought and have had a greater

a crossroads for various cultures since the very early colonial period the port of veracruz has brought cargo sailors seamen and slaves from various parts of the world especially from the caribbean and europe the state has indigenous cultural influences mixed with those from europe africa and the afro-caribbean these can be best seen in the music the culinary traditions and in the people themselves.11 there are also small immigrant communities of spaniards italians basque and lebanese.35 african slaves were imported to mexico through the veracruz port at one point they outnumbered europeans and a significant number ran away from haciendas and plantations to form their own communities sometimes allied with indigenous groups one such rebellion was led by yanga who successfully negotiated a free african community with spanish authorities in 1609 like other groups many of african descent would intermarry with other groups with the category of mulatto existing in the old colonial caste system for those with african blood today the vast majority of afro mexicans in veracruz and other parts of the country are spread out and intermixed with the rest of the population.49

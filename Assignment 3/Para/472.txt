discussions regarding the founding of a college in the province of new york began as early as 1704 at which time colonel lewis morris wrote to the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts the missionary arm of the church of england persuading the society that new york city was an ideal community in which to establish a college.34 however it was not until the founding of the college of new jersey the present princeton university across the hudson river in new jersey that the city of new york seriously consider founding a college.34 in 1746 an act was passed by the general assembly of new york to raise funds for the foundation of a new college in 1751 the assembly appointed a commission of ten new york residents seven of whom were members of the church of england to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.35 classes were initially held in july 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president dr samuel johnson.36 dr johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class which consisted of a mere eight students instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining trinity church located on what is now lower broadway in manhattan.37 the college was officially founded on october 31 1754 as king's college by royal charter of king george ii making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of new york and the fifth oldest in the united states.20 in 1763 dr johnson was succeeded in the presidency by myles cooper a graduate of the queen's college oxford and an ardent tory in the charged political climate of the american revolution his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777 alexander hamilton.38 the american revolutionary war broke out in 1776 and was catastrophic for the operation of king's college which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the continental army the suspension continued through the military occupation of new york city by british troops until their departure in 1783 the college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by american and then british forces.3940 loyalists were forced to abandon their king's college in new york which was seized by the rebels and renamed columbia college the loyalists led by bishop charles inglis fled to windsor nova scotia where they founded king's collegiate school.41 18th centuryedit after the revolution the college turned to the state of new york in order to restore its vitality promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.42 the legislature agreed to assist the college and on may 1 1784 it passed an act for granting certain privileges to the college heretofore called king's college.43 the act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of king's college and in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new republic the legislature stipulated that the college within the city of new york heretofore called king's college be forever hereafter called and known by the name of columbia college43 a reference to columbia an alternative name for america the regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in february 1787 and appointed a revision committee which was headed by john jay and alexander hamilton in april of that same year a new charter was adopted for the college still in use today granting power to a private board of 24 trustees.44 on may 21 1787 william samuel johnson the son of dr samuel johnson was unanimously elected president of columbia college prior to serving at the university johnson had participated in the first continental congress and been chosen as a delegate to the constitutional convention.45 for a period in the 1790s with new york city as the federal and state capital and the country under successive federalist governments a revived columbia thrived under the auspices of federalists such as hamilton and jay both president george washington and vice president john adams attended the college's commencement on may 6 1789 as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the american revolution.46 19th century to presentedit in the aftermath of world war ii the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university and in response the school of international and public affairs was founded in 1946 drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science economics and history.59 during the 1960s columbia experienced large-scale student activism which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus the incident forced the resignation of columbia's president grayson kirk and the establishment of the university senate.6061 though several schools within the university had admitted women for years columbia college first admitted women in the fall of 1983 after a decade of failed negotiations with barnard college the all-female institution affiliated with the university to merge the two schools.62 barnard college still remains affiliated with columbia and all barnard graduates are issued diplomas authorized by both columbia university and barnard college.63 in the 1970s teachers college's departments ran joint ph.d programs with the university in the disciplines of psychology history and anthropology and all teachers college diplomas were conferred by columbia university.50 teachers college was soon established as the university's faculty of education and department of education.51 during the late 20th century the university underwent significant academic structural and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university for much of the 19th century the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in political science philosophy and pure science in 1979 these faculties were merged into the graduate school of arts and sciences.64 in 1991 the faculties of columbia college the school of general studies the graduate school of arts and sciences the school of the arts and the school of professional studies were merged into the faculty of arts and sciences leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools in 2010 the school of international and public affairs which was previously a part of the faculty of arts and sciences became an independent faculty.65 campusedit according

alma mater is centered on the front steps of low memorial library mckim mead  white invited french to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus draped in an academic gown the female figure of alma mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne the scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps representing sapientia and doctrina a book signifying knowledge balances on her lap and an owl the attribute of wisdom is hidden in the folds of her gown her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat terminating with a crown of king's college which refers to columbia's origin as a royalist institution in 1754 a local actress named mary lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture the statue was dedicated on september 23 1903 as a gift of mr  mrs robert goelet and was originally covered in golden leaf during the columbia university protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture but it has since been repaired.76 the small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many columbia legends the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian and that any subsequent columbia male who finds it will marry a barnard student given that barnard is a women's college.7778 the steps alternatively known as low steps or the urban beach are a popular meeting area for columbia students the term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus south field to its upper terrace

major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues the first was columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring morningside park this was seen by the protesters to be an act of aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring harlem a second issue was the columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the pentagon's weapons research think-tank the institute for defense analyses ida students barricaded themselves inside low library hamilton hall and several other university buildings during the protests and new york city police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.194195 the protests achieved two of their stated goals columbia disaffiliated from the ida and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead a popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by princeton university for the expansion of its athletic facilities but as jadwin gymnasium was already 50 complete by 1966 when the columbia gym was announced this was clearly not correct.196 at least 30 columbia students were suspended by the administration as a result of the protests many of the class of '68 walked out of their graduation and held a countercommencement on low plaza with a picnic following at morningside park the place where the protests began.197 the protests hurt columbia financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate money to the school allan bloom a professor of philosophy at the university of chicago believed that the protest efforts at columbia were responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left as a result of the protests bloom stated american universities were no longer places of intellectual and academic debate but rather places of 'political correctness and liberalism.198when? protests against racism and apartheidedit further student protests including hunger strike and more barricades of hamilton hall and the business school199 during the late 1970s and early 1980s were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the apartheid regime in south africa a notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978 when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968 students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in south africa the committee against investment in south africa caisa and numerous student groups including the socialist action committee the black student organization and the gay students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a u.s university the initial and partial columbia divestment200 focused largely on bonds and financial institutions directly involved with the south african regime.201 it followed a year-long campaign first initiated by students who had worked together to block the appointment of former united states secretary of state henry kissinger to an endowed chair at the university in 1977.202 broadly backed by student groups and many faculty members the committee against investment in south africa held teach-ins and demonstrations through the year focused on the trustees ties to the corporations doing business with south africa trustee meetings were picketed and interrupted by demonstrations culminating in may 1978 in the takeover of the graduate school of business.203204 ahmadinejad speech controversyedit the school of international and public affairs extends invitations to heads of state and heads of government who come to new york city for the opening of the fall session of the united nations general assembly in 2007 iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on september 24 2007 as part of columbia university's world leaders forum.205 the invitation proved to be highly controversial hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on september 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide university president lee c bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting ahmadenijad speak but with a negative introduction given personally by bollinger this did not mollify those who were displeased with the fact that the iranian leader had been invited onto the campus.206 columbia students though turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the south lawn an estimated 2500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion during his speech ahmadinejad criticized israel's policies towards the palestinians

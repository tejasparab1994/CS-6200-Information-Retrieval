james river  contents  courseedit the james river forms in the appalachian mountains near iron gate on the border between alleghany and botetourt counties from the confluence of the cowpasture and jackson rivers and flows into the chesapeake bay at hampton roads tidal waters extend west to richmond the capital of virginia at the river's fall line the head of navigation larger tributaries draining to the tidal portion include the appomattox river chickahominy river warwick river pagan river and the nansemond river at its mouth near newport news point the elizabeth river and the nansemond river join the james river to form the harbor area known as hampton roads between the tip of the virginia peninsula near old point comfort and the willoughby spit area of norfolk in south hampton roads a channel leads from hampton roads into the southern portion of the chesapeake bay and out to the atlantic ocean a few miles further east many boats pass through this river to import and export virginia products historyedit the navigable portion of the river was the major highway of the colony of virginia during its first 15 years facilitating supply ships delivering supplies and more people from england however for the first five years despite many hopes of gold and riches these ships sent little of monetary value back to the sponsors in 1612 businessman john rolfe successfully cultivated a non-native strain of tobacco which proved popular in england soon the river became the primary means of exporting the large hogsheads of this cash crop from an ever-growing number of plantations with wharfs along its banks this development made the proprietary efforts of the virginia company of london successful financially spurring even more development investments and immigration below the falls at richmond many james river plantations had their own wharfs and additional ports and/or early railheads were located at warwick bermuda hundred city point claremont scotland and smithfield and during the 17th century the capital of the colony at jamestown navigation of the james river played an important role in early virginia commerce and the settlement of the interior although growth of the colony was primarily in the tidewater region during the first 75 years the upper reaches of the river above the head of navigation at the fall line were explored by fur trading parties sent by abraham wood during the late 17th century although ocean-going ships were unable to navigate beyond present-day richmond portage of products and navigation with smaller craft to transport crops other than tobacco was feasible produce from the piedmont and great valley regions traveled down the river to seaports at richmond and manchester through such port towns as lynchburg scottsville columbia and buchanan james river and kanawha canaledit the james river was considered as a route for transport of produce from the ohio valley the james river and kanawha canal was built for this purpose to provide a navigable portion of the kanawha river a tributary of the ohio river for the most mountainous section between the two points the james river and kanawha turnpike was built to provide a portage link via wagons and stagecoaches however before the canal could be fully completed in the mid-19th century railroads emerged as a more practical technology and eclipsed canals for economical transportation the chesapeake and ohio railway c&o was completed between richmond and the ohio river at the new city of huntington west virginia by 1873 dooming the canal's economic prospects in the 1880s the richmond and alleghany railroad was laid along the eastern portion of the canal's towpath and became part of the c&o within 10 years in modern times this rail line is used primarily in transporting west virginia coal to export coal piers at newport news recreationedit damsedit due to its potential for generating mechanical power for rotating machinery such as grist mills hydroelectric power and as a water route for trade many dams have been built across the james river since the time of european settlement of the region while most of these dams have been removed or failed several dams still exist along the upper course of the river from the head of the river downstream to richmond are found the following dams as identified by the current us army corps of engineers national inventory of dams:6 the tallest dam is the reusens dam which also has the greatest hydroelectric nameplate capacity and the greatest reservoir capacity at 1617 feet the longest dam is the cushaw hydroelectric project due to the highly angled path the dam takes across the river while not identified in the national inventory of dams a very low head weir structure is found below bosher dam in richmond on either side of williams island known as the z-dam for its zigzag course on the south side of the island the current structure was built in 1932 and serves to direct water into richmond's water treatment facility on the north bank the less than 5 feet tall dam does not serve any power or navigation purpose.78 bridgesedit highway bridges below richmondedit

dimensionless quantity in dimensional analysis a dimensionless quantity is a quantity to which no physical dimension is applicable it is also known as a bare number or a quantity of dimension one1 and the corresponding unit of measurement in the si is one or 1 unit23 and it is not explicitly shown dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields such as mathematics physics engineering and economics by contrast examples of quantities with dimensions are length time and speed which are measured in dimensional units such as metre second and metre per second  contents  historyedit pure numbersedit ratios proportions and anglesedit another consequence of the theorem is that the functional dependence between a certain number say n of variables can be reduced by the number say k of independent dimensions occurring in those variables to give a set of p  n  k independent dimensionless quantities for the purposes of the experimenter different systems that share the same description by dimensionless quantity are equivalent exampleedit dimensionless physical constantsedit certain fundamental physical constants such as the speed of light in a vacuum the universal gravitational constant planck's constant and boltzmann's constant can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for time length mass charge and temperature are chosen the resulting system of units is known as the natural units however not all physical constants can be normalized in this fashion for example the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units and must be determined experimentally:9 other quantities produced by nondimensionalizationedit physics and engineeringedit chemistryedit other fieldsedit see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

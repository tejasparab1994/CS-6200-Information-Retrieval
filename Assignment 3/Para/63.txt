diamond dust diamond dust is a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals this meteorological phenomenon is also referred to simply as ice crystals and is reported in the metar code as ic diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies so it is sometimes referred to as clear-sky precipitation it is most commonly observed in antarctica and the arctic but it can occur anywhere with a temperature well below freezing in polar regions diamond dust may continue for several days without interruption  contents  characteristicsedit diamond dust briefly observed at tsukuba japan these are serial photos out of a movie note differences in crystal locations formationedit these ice crystals usually form when a temperature inversion is present at the surface and the warmer air above the ground mixes with the colder air near the surface.1 since warmer air frequently contains more water vapor than colder air this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air near the surface causing the relative humidity of the near-surface air to increase if the relative humidity increase near the surface is large enough then ice crystals may form artificial diamond dust can form from snow machines which blow ice crystals into the air these are found at ski resorts optical propertiesedit climatologyedit weather reporting and interferenceedit diamond dust may sometimes cause a problem for automated airport weather stations the ceilometer and visibility sensor do not always correctly interpret the falling diamond dust and report the visibility and ceiling as zero overcast skies however a human observer would correctly notice clear skies and unrestricted visibility the metar identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is ic.3 see alsoedit references and additional materialedit internetedit booksedit external linksedit note that images are different from naked eye in that they capture out-of-focus crystals which are shown as large blurred objects by naked eye diamond dust looks more like the photo below navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

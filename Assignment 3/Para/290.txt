hindustani language  contents  historyedit in the 18th century towards the end of the mughal period with the fragmentation of the empire and the elite system a variant of khariboli one of the successors of apabhramsha vernaculars at delhi and nearby cities came to gradually replace persian as the lingua franca among the educated elite upper class particularly in northern india though persian still retained much of its pre-eminence for a short period the term hindustani literally of hindustan was the name given to that variant of khariboli as an emerging common dialect hindustani absorbed large numbers of persian arabic and turkic words and as mughal conquests grew it spread as a lingua franca across much of northern india written in the perso-arabic script or devanagari script26 it remained the primary lingua franca of northern india for the next four centuries although it varied significantly in vocabulary depending on the local language and achieved the status of a literary language alongside persian in muslim courts its development was centred on the poets of the mughal courts of cities in uttar pradesh such as delhi lucknow and agra john fletcher hurst in his book published in 1891 mentioned that the hindustani or camp language or language of the camps of moughal courts at delhi was not regarded by philologists as distinct language but only as a dialect of hindi with admixture of persian he continued but it has all the magnitude and importance of separate language it is linguistic result of muslim rule of eleventh  twelfth centuries and is spoken except in rural bengal  by many hindus in north india and by musalman population in all parts of india next to english it was the official language of british indian empire was commonly written in arabic or persian characters and was spoken by approximately 100000000 people.27 when the british colonised the indian subcontinent from the late 18th through to the late 19th century they used the words 'hindustani' 'hindi and 'urdu interchangeably they developed it as the language of administration of british india28 further preparing it to be the official language of modern india and pakistan however with independence use of the word 'hindustani declined being largely replaced by 'hindi and 'urdu' or 'hindi-urdu when either of those was too specific more recently the word 'hindustani has been used for the colloquial language of bollywood films which are popular in both india and pakistan and which cannot be unambiguously identified as either hindi or urdu registersedit although at the spoken level hindi and urdu are considered registers of a single language they differ vastly in literary and formal vocabulary where literary hindi draws heavily on sanskrit and to a lesser extent prakrit literary urdu draws heavily on persian and arabic the grammar and base vocabulary most pronouns verbs adpositions etc. of both hindi and urdu however are the same and derive from a prakritic base and both have a persian/arabic influence the standardised registers hindi and urdu are collectively known as hindi-urdu hindustani is perhaps the lingua franca of the north and west of the indian subcontinent though it is understood fairly well in other regions also especially in the urban areas a common vernacular sharing characteristics with sanskritised hindi regional hindi and urdu hindustani is more commonly used as a vernacular than highly sanskritised hindi or highly arabicised/persianised urdu this can be seen in the popular culture of bollywood or more generally the vernacular of north indians and pakistanis which generally employs a lexicon common to both hindi and urdu speakers minor subtleties in region will also affect the 'brand of hindustani sometimes pushing the hindustani closer to urdu or to hindi one might reasonably assume that the hindustani spoken in lucknow uttar pradesh known for its usage of urdu and varanasi a holy city for hindus and thus using highly sanskritised hindi is somewhat different modern standard hindiedit standard hindi one of the official languages of india is based on the khariboli dialect of the delhi region and differs from urdu in that it is usually written in the indigenous devanagari script of india and exhibits less persian and arabic influence than urdu many scholars today employ a sanskritised form of hindi developed primarily in varanasi the hindu holy city which is based on the eastern hindi dialect of that region and thus a separate language from official standard hindi.citation needed it has a literature of 500 years with prose poetry religion  philosophy under the bahmani kings and later on khutab shahi adil shahi etc it is a living language still prevalent all over the deccan plateau note that the term hindustani has generally fallen out of common usage in modern india except to refer to indian as a nationality29 and a style of indian classical music prevalent in northern india the term used to refer to it is hindi or urdu depending on the religion of the speaker and regardless of the mix of persian or sanskrit words used by the speaker one could conceive of a wide spectrum of dialects and registers with the highly persianised urdu at one end of the spectrum and a heavily sanskrit-based dialect spoken in the region around varanasi at the other end of the spectrum in common usage in india the term hindi includes all these dialects except those at the urdu end of the spectrum thus the different meanings of the word hindi include among others modern standard urduedit urdu is the national language of pakistan and an officially recognised regional language of india urdu is the official language of all pakistani provinces and is taught in all schools as a compulsory subject up to the 12th grade it is also an official language in the indian states of jammu and kashmir national capital territory of delhi uttar pradesh bihar telangana that have significant muslim populations bazaar hindustaniedit in a specific sense hindustani may be used to refer to the dialects and varieties used in common speech in contrast with the standardised hindi and urdu this meaning is reflected in the use of the term bazaar hindustani in other words the language of the street or the marketplace as opposed to the perceived refinement of formal hindi urdu or even sanskrit thus the webster's new world dictionary defines the term hindustani as the principal dialect of hindi/urdu used as a trade language throughout north india and pakistan namesedit grierson in his highly influential linguistic survey of india proposed that the names hindustani urdu and hindi be separated in use for different varieties of the hindustani language rather than as the overlapping synonyms they frequently were literatureedit official statusedit urdu also a major standardized register of hindustani is also one of the languages recognized by the indian constitution and is an official language of the indian states of telangana bihar delhi jammu and kashmir and uttar pradesh although the government school system in most other states emphasises modern standard hindi at universities in cities such as lucknow aligarh and hyderabad urdu is spoken and learnt and saaf urdu is treated with just as much respect as shuddha hindi urdu is also the national language of pakistan where it shares official language status with english although english is spoken by many punjabi is the native language of the majority of the population urdu is the lingua franca hindustani was the official language of the british indian empire and was synonymous with both hindi and urdu.283536 after india's independence in 1947 the sub-committee on fundamental rights recommended that the official language of india be hindustani however this recommendation was not adopted by the constituent assembly hindustani outside south asiaedit besides being the lingua franca of north india and pakistan in south asia hindustani is also spoken by many in the south asian diaspora and their descendants around the world including north america in canada for example hindustani is one of the fastest growing languages38 and the middle east hindustani was also one of the languages that was spoken widely in burma during british rule many older burmese particularly the anglo-indians and anglo-burmese of the country still know it although it has had no official status in the country since military rule hindustani is also spoken in the countries of the gulf cooperation council where migrant labour workers from various countries live and work for several years phonologyedit grammaredit vocabularyedit hindustani contains around 5500 words of persian and arabic origin.39 writing systemedit historically hindustani was written in the kaithi devanagari and urdu alphabets.26 kaithi and devanagari are two of the brahmic scripts native to india whereas urdu is a derivation of the perso-arabic script nastaliq which is preferred calligraphic style for urdu today hindustani continues to be written in the urdu alphabet and this is nearly exclusive in pakistan in india the hindi register is officially written in devanagari a relative of kaithi and urdu in perso-arabic script nastaliq to the extent that these standards are partly defined by their script however in popular publications in india urdu is also written in devanagari script with slight variations to establish a devanagari urdu alphabet alongside the devanagari hindi alphabet because of anglicisation in south asia and the international use of the latin script hindustani is occasionally written in the latin script this adaptation is called roman urdu or romanised hindi depending upon the register used because the bollywood film industry is a major proponent of the latin script the use of latin script to write in hindi and urdu is growing amongst younger internet users.citation needed since urdu and hindi are mutually intelligible when spoken romanised hindi and roman urdu unlike devanagari hindi and urdu in the urdu alphabet are mutually intelligible as well sample textedit following is a sample text article 1 of

cirrus cloud cirrus clouds form on other planets including mars jupiter saturn uranus and possibly neptune they have even been seen on titan one of saturn's moons some of these extraterrestrial cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice the term cirrus is also used for certain interstellar clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains  contents  descriptionedit the ice crystals in cirrus clouds have different shapes in addition to different sizes some shapes include solid columns hollow columns plates rosettes and conglomerations of the various other types the shape of the ice crystals is determined by the air temperature atmospheric pressure and ice supersaturation cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type the columns and plates tend to be at the top of the cloud whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base.6 in the northern arctic region cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns plates and conglomerations and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size in antarctica cirrus are usually composed of only the columns and these columns are much longer than normal.6 scientists have studied the characteristics of cirrus using several different methods one light detection and ranging lidar gives highly accurate information on the cloud's altitude length and width balloon-carried hygrometers give information on the humidity of the cirrus cloud but are not accurate enough to measure the depth of the cloud radar units give information on the altitudes and thicknesses of cirrus clouds.8 another data source is satellite measurements from the stratospheric aerosol and gas experiment sage program these satellites measure where infrared radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere and if it is absorbed at cirrus altitudes then it is assumed that there are cirrus clouds in that location.9 the united states national aeronautics and space administration's nasa moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis also gives information on the cirrus cloud cover by measuring reflected infrared radiation of various specific frequencies during the day during the night it determines cirrus cover by detecting the earth's infrared emissions the cloud reflects this radiation back to the ground thus enabling satellites to see the shadow it casts into space.10 visual observations from aircraft or the ground provide additional information about cirrus clouds.9 based upon data taken from the united states using these methods cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally the researchers found that in the summer at noon the cover is the lowest with an average of 23 of the united states land area covered by cirrus around midnight the cloud cover increases to around 28% in winter the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night these percentages include clear days and nights as well as days and nights with other cloud types as lack of cirrus cloud cover when these clouds are present the typical coverage ranges from 30 to 50%.4 based on satellite data cirrus covers an average of 20 to 25 of the earth's surface in the tropical regions this cloud covers around 70 of the region's surface area.6 formationedit cyclonesedit thunderstormsedit thunderstorms can form dense cirrus at their tops as the cumulonimbus cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically the liquid water droplets freeze when the air temperature reaches the freezing point.17 the anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher thus creating the flat top.18 in the tropics these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils.19 high-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.18 individual cirrus cloud formations can be the remnants of anvil clouds formed by thunderstorms in the dissipating stage of a cumulonimbus cloud when the normal column rising up to the anvil has evaporated or dissipated the mat of cirrus in the anvil is all that is left.20 contrailsedit contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud formed when water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine condenses on particles which come from either the surrounding air or the exhaust itself and freezes leaving behind a visible trail the exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei when there is an insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere.7 one of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus21 and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in earth's atmosphere.2122 subformsedit speciesedit cirrus fibratus clouds appear as thin and fibrous looking noticeably they are the most common type of cirrus cloud they might indicate windy weather since they are mostly formed by wind shear on higher altitudes cirrus uncinus clouds appear as thin and fibrous like except that they always have a hook or curl on the tip cirrus spissatus clouds are the highest clouds of the main cloud genera they may form in the higher tropopause or even at the lower stratosphere they are dense and opaque not allowing the light of the sun or moon to pass through they are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds cirrus floccus is derived from latin which means lock of wool or cirrus with ragged bases they are not to be confused with cirrocumulus floccus since they are larger than cirrocumulus and mostly are isolated a precipitation-based supplementary feature virga is mostly visible which makes it easier to distinguish the difference between cirrocumulus floccus and cirrus floccus cirrus castellanus is derived from latin which means castle or round turrets they indicate that atmospheric instability is occurring on the higher altitudes of the troposphere they appear as tall clouds that originate from a flat base opacity-based varietiesedit cirrus clouds are translucent and so have no opacity-based varieties only one species is opaque which is cirrus spissatus pattern-based varietiesedit cirrus intortus clouds is derived from latin which means twisted or wound these clouds appear twisted or simply intorted cirrus vertebratus clouds resembling the appearance of bones as hinted by the word vertebratus they look more like fish bones with fibrous lines that originate from one which resembles the appearance of fish bones cirrus radiatus clouds appear as parallel lines that seem to originate from one point and can stretch for hundreds of miles and they move parallel to the wind shear use in forecastingedit random isolated cirrus do not have any particular significance.15 a large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance this signals a change in weather in the near future which usually becomes stormier.23 if the cloud is a cirrus castellanus there might be instability at the high altitude level.15 when the clouds deepen and spread especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species this usually indicates an approaching weather front if it is a warm front the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus the next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds.21524 when cirrus clouds precede a cold front squall line or multicellular thunderstorm it is because they are blown off the anvil and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds.24 kelvin-helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.15 effects on climateedit as a result of their warming effects when relatively thin cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming.30 scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase thereby increasing temperatures and humidity this in turn would increase the cirrus cloud cover effectively creating a positive feedback circuit a prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth.7 in addition the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the earth's infrared radiation to balance out.733 a similar hypothesis put forth by richard lindzen is the iris hypothesis in which an increase in tropical sea surface temperatures results in less cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted to space.34 optical phenomenaedit cirrus clouds like cirrostratus clouds can produce several optical effects such as halos around the sun and moon halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds which depending on their shape and orientation can result in a wide variety of white and colored rings arcs and spots in the sky common halo varieties are the 22 halo sun dogs the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc also known as fire rainbows.63536 halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus relation to other cloudsedit summary of high cloud generaedit there are three main genera in the family of high clouds cirrus cirrocumulus and cirrostratus.41 cirrostratus clouds commonly produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals.42 cirrocumulus and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as cirriform clouds because of their frequent association with cirrus they are given the prefix cirro- but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus and cirrostratus is stratiform like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds cirrocumulusedit cirrocumulus clouds form in sheets or patches43 and do not cast shadows they commonly appear in regular rippling patterns41 or in rows of clouds with clear areas between.2 cirrocumulus are like other members of the cumuliform category formed via convective processes.44 significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather.4546 the ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders they are not solid but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends towards the top of the cloud these crystals have a tendency to clump together.47 these clouds do not last long and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals they eventually begin to fall destroying the upward convection the cloud then dissipates into cirrus.48 cirrocumulus clouds come in four species stratiformis lenticularis castellanus and floccus.45 they are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.46 cirrostratusedit extraterrestrialedit on jupiter cirrus clouds are composed of ammonia when jupiter's south equatorial belt disappeared one hypothesis put forward by glenn orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it hiding it from view.56 nasa's cassini probe detected these clouds on saturn57 and thin water-ice cirrus on saturn's moon titan.58 cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on uranus.59 on neptune thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the great dark spot as on uranus these are probably methane crystals.60 interstellar cirrus clouds are composed of tiny dust grains smaller than a micrometer and are therefore not true clouds of this genus which are composed of ice crystals or other frozen liquids.61 they range from a few light years to dozens of light years across while they are not technically cirrus clouds the dust clouds are referred to as cirrus because of their similarity to the clouds on earth they also emit infrared radiation similar to the way cirrus clouds on earth reflect heat being radiated out into space.62 see alsoedit sourcesedit footnotes bibliography external linksedit navigation menu personal

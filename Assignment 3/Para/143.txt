rainband a rainband is a cloud and precipitation structure associated with an area of rainfall which is significantly elongated rainbands can be stratiform or convective1 and are generated by differences in temperature when noted on weather radar imagery this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure.2 rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that together with the eyewall and the eye constitute a hurricane or tropical storm the extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity rainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries if enough moisture is present if sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front they can mask the location of the cold front itself banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain or snow behind extratropical cyclones rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the great lakes if the atmosphere is cold enough these rainbands can yield heavy snow  contents  extratropical cyclonesedit tropical cyclonesedit some rainbands move closer to the center forming a secondary or outer eyewall within intense hurricanes.16 spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins use of the satellite-based dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds.17 within this method the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure.18 central pressure values for their centers of low pressure derived from this technique are approximate different programs have been studying these rainbands including rainex forced by geographyedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

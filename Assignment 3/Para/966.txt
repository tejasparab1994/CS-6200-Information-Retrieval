kennedy space center the john f kennedy space center ksc is one of ten national aeronautics and space administration field centers since december 1968 kennedy space center has been nasa's primary launch center of human spaceflight launch operations for the apollo skylab and space shuttle programs were carried out from kennedy space center launch complex 39 and managed by ksc.2 located on the east coast of florida ksc is adjacent to cape canaveral air force station ccafs the management of the two entities work very closely together share resources and even own facilities on each other's property though the first apollo flights and all project mercury and project gemini flights took off from ccafs the launches were managed by ksc and its previous organization the launch operations directorate.34 starting with the fourth gemini mission the nasa launch control center in florida mercury control center later the launch control center began handing off control of the vehicle to the mission control center shortly after liftoff in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission.56 additionally the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions researches food production and in-situ resource utilization for off earth exploration7 and more since 2010 the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships8 even adding a new launch pad lc-39c in 2015  contents  formationedit the military had been performing launch operations since 1949 at what would become cape canaveral air force station in december 1959 the department of defense transferred 5000 personnel and the missile firing laboratory to nasa to become the launch operations directorate under nasa's marshall space flight center on november 29 1963 the facility was given its current name by president lyndon b johnson under executive order 11129.1314 johnson's order joined both the civilian loc and the military cape canaveral station the facilities of station no 1 of the atlantic missile range under the designation john f kennedy space center spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind nasa administrator james e webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the kennedy space center name applied only to the loc while the air force issued a general order renaming the military launch site cape kennedy air force station.15 locationedit ksc is a major central florida tourist destination and is approximately one hour's drive from the orlando area the kennedy space center visitor complex offers public tours of the center and cape canaveral air force station because much of the installation is a restricted area and only nine percent of the land is developed the site also serves as an important wildlife sanctuary mosquito lagoon indian river merritt island national wildlife refuge and canaveral national seashore are other features of the area center workers can encounter bald eagles american alligators wild boars eastern diamondback rattlesnakes the endangered florida panthercitation needed and florida manatees historical programsedit apollo programedit skylabedit space shuttleedit as the space shuttle was being designed nasa received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than ksc which demanded study ksc had important advantages including its existing facilities location on the intracoastal waterway and its southern latitude which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits disadvantages included its inability to safely launch military missions into polar orbit since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the carolinas or cuba corrosion from the salt air and frequent cloudy or stormy weather although building a new site at white sands missile range in new mexico was seriously considered nasa announced its decision in april 1972 to use ksc for the shuttle.16 since the shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control the launch of columbia on april 12 1981 for its first orbital mission sts-1 was nasa's first manned launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior unmanned launches in 1976 the vab's south parking area was the site of third century america a science and technology display commemorating the u.s bicentennial concurrent with this event the u.s flag was painted on the south side of the vab during the late 1970s lc-39 was reconfigured to support the space shuttle two orbiter processing facilities were built near the vab as hangars with a third added in the 1980s after 24 successful shuttle flights challenger was torn apart 73 seconds after the launch of sts-51-l on january 28 1986 the first shuttle launch from pad 39b and the first u.s manned launch failure killing the seven crew members an o-ring seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff leading to subsequent structural failures flights resumed on september 29 1988 with sts-26 after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle program on february 1 2003 columbia and her crew of seven were lost during re-entry over texas during the sts-107 mission the 113th shuttle flight a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from pad 39a on january 16 when a piece of foam insulation from the orbiter's external fuel tank struck the orbiter's left wing during reentry the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure like the challenger disaster the resulting investigation and modifications interrupted shuttle flight operations at ksc for more than two years until the sts-114 launch on july 26 2005 the shuttle program experienced five main engine shutdowns at lc-39 all within four seconds before launch and one abort to orbit sts-51-f on july 29 1985 shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes conducting space science and technology experiments visits to the russian mir space station construction and servicing of the international space station deployment and servicing of the hubble space telescope and serving as a space laboratory the shuttle was retired from service in july 2011 after 135 launches constellationedit on october 28 2009 the ares i-x launch from pad 39b was the first unmanned launch from ksc since the skylab workshop in 1973 expendable launch vehicles elvsedit beginning in 1958 nasa and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches previously referred to as unmanned18 cooperating as they broke ground in the field in the early 1960s nasa had as many as two robotic mission launches a month the frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles as engineers gathered data learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades in 1963 with the intent of ksc elv work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities a separate atlas/centaur organization was formed under nasa's lewis center now glenn research center grc taking that responsibility from the launch operations center aka ksc.6 though almost all robotics missions launched from the cape canaveral air force station ccafs ksc oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the cape.6 in 1965 ksc's unmanned launch operations directorate became responsible all nasa unmanned launch operations including those at vandenberg air force base from the 1950s to 1978 ksc chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the u.s. overseeing their near launch processing and checkout in addition to government missions ksc performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also though non-u.s government entities provided reimbursement nasa also funded ccafs launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements all this changed with the commercial space launch act of 1984 after which nasa only coordinated its own and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa elv launches companies were able to operate their own launch vehicles6 and utilize nasa's launch facilities payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of ksc reagan's 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from ksc to commercial companies.19 that same year launch complexes on ccafs started transferring from nasa to air force management.6 in the 1990s though ksc was not performing the hands-on elv work engineers still maintained understanding of elvs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight ksc also worked on elv research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize ksc personnel as a resource for technical issues ksc with the payload and launch vehicle industries developed advances in automation of the elv launch and ground operations for the purpose of enabling competitiveness of u.s rockets against the global market.6 in 1998 the launch services program lsp formed at ksc pulling together programs and personnel that already existed at ksc grc goddard space flight center and more to manage the launch of nasa and noaa robotic missions ccafs and vafb are the primary launch sites for lsp missions though other sites are occasionally used lsp payloads such as the mars science laboratory have been processed at ksc before being transferred to a launch pad on ccafs space station processingedit as the international space station modules design began in the early 1990s ksc began to work with other nasa centers and international partners to prepare for processing prior to launch on board the space shuttles ksc utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 spacelab missions in the operations and checkout building to gather expectations of iss processing these experiences were incorporated into the design of the space station processing facility sspf which began construction in 1993 the space station directorate formed in 1996 ksc personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes.6 from 1997 to 2007 ksc planned and performed on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules three multi-element integration testing meit sessions and the integration systems test ist numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbit today ksc continues to process iss payloads from across the world prior to launch along with developing its own experiments for on orbit.20 current programs and initiativesedit the following are current programs and initiatives at kennedy space center:21 facilitiesedit facilities at the kennedy space center are directly related to its mission to launch and in some cases recover missions facilities are available to prepare and maintain spacecraft and payloads for flight.2930 the headquarters hq building houses offices for the center director library film and photo archives a print shop and security.31 a new headquarters building is under construction as a part of the central campus consolidation and the first phase is expected to be complete in 2017.9323334 payload processingedit launch complex 39edit launch complex 39 lc-39 was originally built for the saturn v the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history for the apollo manned moon landing program since the end of the apollo program in 1972 lc-39 has been used to launch every nasa human space flight including skylab 1973 the apollo-soyuz test project 1975 and the space shuttle program 1981-2011 the complex includes commercial leasingedit as a part of promoting commercial space industry growth in the area and the overall center as a multi-user spaceport4243 ksc leases some of its properties here are some major examples visitor complexedit it was announced on may 29 2015 that the astronaut hall of fame exhibit would be moved from its current location to another location within the visitor complex to make room for an upcoming high-tech attraction entitled heroes and legends the attraction to be designed by orlando-based design firm falcon's treehouse is slated to open sometime late 2016.49 in march 2016 the visitor center unveiled the new location of the iconic countdown clock at the complex's entrance previously the clock was located with a flagpole at the press site the clock was originally built and installed in 1969 and listed with the flagpole in the national register of historic places in january 2000.50 historic locationsedit nasa lists the following historic districts at ksc each district has multiple associated facilities:515253 there are 24 historic properties outside of these historic districts including the space shuttle atlantis vehicle assembly building crawlerway and operations and checkout building.51 ksc has one national historic landmark 78 national register of historic places nrhp listed or eligible sites and 100 archaeological sites.54 weatheredit florida's peninsular shape and temperature contrasts between land and ocean provide ideal conditions for electrical storms earning central florida the reputation as lightning capital of the united states.5556 this makes extensive lightning protection and detection systems necessary to protect employees structures and spacecraft on launch pads.57 on november 14 1969 apollo 12 was struck by lightning just after lift-off from pad 39a but the flight continued safely the most powerful lightning strike recorded at ksc occurred at lc-39b on august 25 2006 while shuttle atlantis was being prepared for sts-115 nasa managers were initially concerned that the lightning strike caused damage to atlantis but none was found.58 ksc directorsedit since ksc's formation ten nasa officials have served as directors including three former astronauts crippen bridges and cabana labor forceedit when ksc separated from marshall space flight center in july 1962 it took 375 employees with it in may 1965 ksc had 7000 employees and contractors move from rented space in cocoa beach to the new merritt island facilities the peak number of persons working on center was 26000 in 1968 3000 were civil servants in 1970 president nixon announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at ksc by 1974 ksc's workforce was down to 10000 employees 2408 civil servants.6 a total of 13100 people worked at the center as of 2011 approximately 2100 are employees of the federal government the rest are contractors.70 the average annual salary for an on-site worker in 2008 was $77235.71 the end of the space shuttle program in 2011 preceded by the cancellation of constellation program in 2010 produced a significant downsizing of the ksc workforce similar to that experienced at the end of the apollo program in 1972 as part of this downsizing 6000 contractors lost their jobs at the center during 2010 and 2011.72 see alsoedit referencesedit

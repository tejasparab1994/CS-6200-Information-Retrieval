hurricane agnes  contents  meteorological historyedit preparationsedit impactedit united statesedit agnes was at the time the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states though it has since been surpassed by numerous other storms floridaedit southeastern united statesedit virginiaedit overall flooding was described as the worst in 50 years.28 in virginia alone 13 fatalities and $125.9 million in losses were reported.22 marylandedit hardest hit was the patapsco river valley with widespread destruction of buildings roads and railroads in the state park at daniels including its mill35 at ellicott city and oella the flooding was first reported in the early morning hours of june 22 and water was reported as high as 40 feet above normal.36 river road along the patapsco was almost completely washed out more than 900 people were evacuated from their homes national guard helicopters were used to rescue workmen from the roof of the daniels plant in elkridge a family of six was forced from their home and they attempted to reach high ground in a small boat it capsized and all six held onto the boat for several hours until it reached more shallow water in howard county a total of 704 county residents were left homeless more than 80 homes in the ellicott city area were damaged and 72 homes in elkridge were affected in laurel the 9th street bridge crossing the patuxent river was washed away by flood waters in anne arundel county all roads linking the county with baltimore city or county were closed including the baltimore beltway as were all roads near the patuxent river including waysons corner where over 300 homes were evacuated.32 the patapsco flooded residential homes in parts of the county's north linthicum pumphrey and belle grove road brooklyn park neighborhoods.32 the gwynn oak amusement park closed after suffering severe damage from flooding when hurricane agnes caused gwynns falls to overflow in 1974 the park's rides were auctioned off the carousel was moved and is still in operation on the national mall in washington d.c a popular footbridge in the chesapeake and ohio canal national historical park which led across a branch of the potomac river to an overlook of great falls was washed away and not rebuilt until 1996.37 as a result of agnes rains conowingo dam astride the susquehanna river just north of the chesapeake bay recorded its all-time highest flow rate and stream heights.38 before the river crested the water came within feet of overtopping the dam as the dam's normal flood control devices seemed unable to cope engineers had placed charges to blow out a section of the dam to prevent a catastrophic failure pennsylvaniaedit on june 26 1972 three news correspondents were killed in a helicopter crash in harrisburg where they had been covering the flooding the victims were del vaughn of cbs news and sid brenner and louis clark of wcau in philadelphia and the pilot mike sedio the helicopter lost its rotor some three hundred feet above the capital city airport crashed and exploded on the runway.42 new yorkedit olean elmira and corning as well as many other southern tier towns were severely flooded sections of the former erie railroad main line between hornell and binghamton were damaged flooding in the upper allegheny river basin was particularly exacerbated by the construction of the kinzua dam less than a decade prior several towns in cattaraugus county suffered extensive road and bridge damage that four decades later has yet to be repaired with the state and local governments opting to abandon creek and river crossings instead of reconstruct them however said dam construction allegedly succeeded in preventing further damage downstream in pennsylvania and much of the flood-prone areas in the allegheny reservoir region had already been cleared of residents in preparation for the dam's construction hornell's damage was minimal largely due to the protection of two dam systems installed after the devastating 1935 flood both the arkport and almond dams saved hornell from the level of damage found in neighboring communities three us army corp of engineers were killed in hornell when their helicopter came in contact with power lines over crosby creek the height of the floodwaters has been marked in the entrance to the corning museum of glass showing that much of the museum was under water to a height of about 1.6 m above the floor causing substantial damage to the collection and archives parts of corning were under more than 3 m of flood waters west virginia and ohioedit elsewhere in the united statesedit elsewhereedit in canada hurricane agnes gave heavy rains and winds over southern ontario and southern quebec causing numerous floodings around lake erie and lake ontario in the town of maniwaki quebec the storm toppled a mobile home killing two people.49 aftermathedit following the storm then-president of the united states richard nixon declared the states of florida virginia maryland pennsylvania and new york as disaster areas agnes had a devastating impact on the already-bankrupt railroads in the northeastern united states as lines were washed out and shipments were delayed the resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed conrailcitation needed the severe floods near lawrenceville pennsylvania were the catalyst for the construction of the tioga reservoir in 1973 the flooding in wilkes-barre pennsylvania and the adjacent town of kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and in the same year was deemed very safe and protective by the army corps of engineers the levee also protected the area from the remnants of tropical storm lee and hurricane irene in 2011 with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure conversely the existing kinzua dam built against the wishes of the seneca nation of new york spared much of western pennsylvania from the worst flooding by filling the allegheny reservoir to capacity retirementedit because of extensive damage and severe death tolls the name agnes was retired following this storm and will never again be used for another atlantic hurricane.52 because the tropical cyclone naming lists were changed in 1979 there was no replacement

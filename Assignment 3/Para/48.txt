landspout a landspout is a term coined by meteorologist howard b bluestein in 1985 for a kind of tornado not associated with a mesocyclone.1 the glossary of meteorology defines a landspout as landspouts form during the growth stage of a cumulus congestus cloud by stretching boundary layer vorticity upward and into the cumulus congestus's updraft they generally are smaller and weaker than supercell tornadoes and do not form from a mesocyclone or pre-existing rotation in the cloud because of this landspouts are rarely detected by doppler weather radar.3 landspouts share a strong resemblance and development process to that of waterspouts usually taking the form of a translucent and highly laminar helical tube landspouts are considered tornadoes since a rotating column of air is in contact with both the surface and a cumuliform cloud not all landspouts are visible and many are first sighted as debris swirling at the surface before eventually filling in with condensation and dust a few landspouts can persist in excess of 15 minutes and have produced f3 damage;4 however they rarely produce damage greater than ef-2.citation needed see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

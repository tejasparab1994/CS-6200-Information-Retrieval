hurricane debbie 1969  contents  meteorological historyedit the storm turned northward on august 216 and eventually curved northeastward debbie weakened to category 2 strength but for the fourth time restrengthened to major hurricane intensity.1 the hurricane then passed well to the southeast of bermuda1 although it is believed that if not for the presence of nearby hurricane camille which emerged into the atlantic from the united states on august 20 debbie would have likely ended up further west closer to the island.5 it maintained its severity through august 22 as it continued generally toward the northeast.1 impact and project stormfuryedit debbie was subject to an experiment called project stormfury which attempted to weaken tropical cyclones by seeding them with silver iodide.5 the storm provided an excellent opportunity to test the underpinnings of project stormfury in many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding it did not threaten any land it passed within range of seeding aircraft and was intense with a distinct eye.9 on august 18 and again on august 20 thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it on the first day windspeeds fell by 31% on the second day windspeeds fell by 18%.510 both changes were consistent with stormfury's working hypothesis the results were so encouraging that a greatly expanded research program was planned.11 among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly intervals.5 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

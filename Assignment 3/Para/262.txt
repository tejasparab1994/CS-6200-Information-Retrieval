acid an acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron proton or hydrogen ion h+ or alternatively capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair a lewis acid.1 common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes acetic acid vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car batteries and citric acid found in citrus fruits as these examples show acids in the colloquial sense can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from acids in the strict1 sense that are solids liquids or gases strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid  contents  definitions and concepts modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids arrhenius acids the swedish chemist svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions h+ or protons in 1884 an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of h ions in the water.45 note that chemists often write h+aq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion h3o+ thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hcl and acetic acid h3oaq  ohaq  h2ol  h2ol due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases it as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia dissolved in benzene react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solid lewis acids dissociation and equilibrium acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton protonation and deprotonation respectively note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as ha  h  a in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution brackets indicate concentration such that h2o means the concentration of h2o the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid ha and the products are the conjugate base and h+ nomenclature in the classical naming system acids are named according to their anions that ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix and sometimes prefix according to the table below for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the -ide suffix makes it take the form hydrochloric acid in the iupac naming system aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound thus for hydrogen chloride the iupac name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride the prefix hydro- is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element classical naming system acid strength stronger acids have a larger ka and a more negative pka than weaker acids sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids a common example is toluenesulfonic acid tosylic acid unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable superacids are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations while ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's ka chemical characteristics monoprotic acids monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation sometimes called ionization as shown below symbolized by ha common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3 on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid examples in organic acids include formic acid hcooh acetic acid ch3cooh and benzoic acid c6h5cooh polyprotic acids polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid two potential protons to donate and triprotic acid three potential protons to donate a diprotic acid here symbolized by h2a can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka1 and ka2 the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second i.e. ka1  ka2 for example sulfuric acid h2so4 can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion hso4 for which ka1 is very large then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion so24 wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid h2co3 can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion hco3 and lose a second to form carbonate anion co23 both ka values are small but ka1  ka2  a triprotic acid h3a can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka1  ka2  ka3 an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid h3po4 usually just called phosphoric acid all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2po4 then hpo24 and finally po34 the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k1 and k2 is known as a bjerrum plot a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n -protic acid that has been deprotonated i -times where k0  1 and the other k-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid neutralization neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base producing a salt and neutralized base for example hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph 7.0 which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt e.g sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form the deprotonated form of the acid in lower-ph more acidic solutions there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions applications of acids there are numerous uses for acids acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery such as sulfuric acid in a car battery strong acids sulfuric acid in particular are widely used in mineral processing for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts for example nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate a fertilizer additionally carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols to produce esters acids are used as additives to drinks and foods as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives phosphoric acid for example is a component of cola drinks acetic acid is used in day-to-day life as vinegar carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids citric acid is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits oxalic acid is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in carambola and rhubarb rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid ascorbic acid vitamin c is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla indian gooseberry lemon citrus fruits and guava certain acids are used as drugs acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers acids play important roles in the human body the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body acid catalysis acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry for example sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline strong acids such as sulfuric phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions in biochemistry many enzymes employ acid catalysis.7 biological occurrence many biologically important molecules are acids nucleic acids which contain acidic phosphate groups include dna and rna nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics and is passed from parents to offspring dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups membranes contain additional components some of which can participate in acid-base reactions in humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin some organisms produce acids for defense for example ants produce formic acid acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing oxygen gas o2 drives cellular respiration the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food producing carbon dioxide co2 as a byproduct oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation for example during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat releasing co2 into the blood stream in aqueous solutions such as blood co2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper expelling the excess co2 and resupplying the cells with o2 cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior many biologically important molecules including a number of pharmaceutical agents are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated uncharged form but not in their charged form i.e as the conjugate base for this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods the charged form however is often more soluble in blood and cytosol both aqueous environments when the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral ph within the cell certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer acids that lose a proton at the intracellular ph will exist in their soluble charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target ibuprofen aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids common acids mineral acids inorganic acids sulfonic acids carboxylic acids a carboxylic acid has the general formula r-cooh where r is an organic radical the carboxyl group -cooh contains a carbonyl group c=o and a hydroxyl group o-h halogenated carboxylic acids halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid vinylogous carboxylic acids normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group in vinylogous carboxylic acids a carbon-carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups nucleic acids references external links navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in

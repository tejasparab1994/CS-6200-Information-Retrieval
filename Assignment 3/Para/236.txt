extratropical cyclone extratropical cyclones sometimes called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones are low-pressure areas which along with the anticyclones of high-pressure areas drive the weather over much of the earth extratropical cyclones are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales thunderstorms blizzards and tornadoes these types of cyclones are defined as large scale synoptic low pressure weather systems that occur in the middle latitudes of the earth in contrast with tropical cyclones extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines called weather fronts about the center of the cyclone.1  contents  terminologyedit the term cyclone applies to numerous types of low pressure areas one of which is the extratropical cyclone the descriptor extratropical signifies that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside the tropics and in the middle latitudes of earth between 30 and 60 latitude they are termed mid-latitude cyclones if they form within those latitudes or post-tropical cyclones if a tropical cyclone has intruded into the mid latitudes.12 weather forecasters and the general public often describe them simply as depressions or lows terms like frontal cyclone frontal depression frontal low extratropical low non-tropical low and hybrid low are often used as well extratropical cyclones are classified mainly as baroclinic because they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient known as frontal zones they can become barotropic late in their life cycle when the distribution of heat around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with its radius.3 formationedit extratropical cyclones form anywhere within the extratropical regions of the earth usually between 30 and 60 latitude from the equator either through cyclogenesis or extratropical transition a study of extratropical cyclones in the southern hemisphere shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period.4 a separate study in the northern hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter.5 cyclogenesisedit extratropical cyclones form along linear bands of temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear and are thus classified as baroclinic cyclones initially cyclogenesis or low pressure formation occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak the favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants where divergence ensues.6 the divergence causes air to rush out from the top of the air column as mass in the column is reduced atmospheric pressure at surface level the weight of the air column is reduced the lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone a low pressure system the lowered pressure acts to draw in air creating convergence in the low-level wind field low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column making cyclones tend to be cloudy as the cyclone strengthens the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone meanwhile its associated warm front progresses more slowly as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser and therefore more difficult to dislodge later the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front forcing a tongue or trowal of warm air aloft eventually the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken extratropical transitionedit tropical cyclones often transform into extratropical cyclones at the end of their tropical existence usually between 30 and 40 latitude where there is sufficient forcing from upper-level troughs or shortwaves riding the westerlies for the process of extratropical transition to begin.13 during this process a cyclone in extratropical transition known across the eastern north pacific and north atlantic oceans as the post-tropical stage1415 will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and/or troughs consistent with a baroclinic system due to this the size of the system will usually appear to increase while the core weakens however after transition is complete the storm may re-strengthen due to baroclinic energy depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system.13 the cyclone will also distort in shape becoming less symmetric with time.161718 during extratropical transition the cyclone begins to tilt back into the colder airmass with height and the cyclone's primary energy source converts from the release of latent heat from condensation from thunderstorms near the center to baroclinic processes the low pressure system eventually loses its warm core and becomes a cold-core system.1816 the peak time of subtropical cyclogenesis the midpoint of this transition in the north atlantic is in the months of september and october when the difference between the temperature of the air aloft and the sea surface temperature is the greatest leading to the greatest potential for instability.19 on rare occasions an extratropical cyclone can transit into a tropical cyclone if it reaches an area of ocean with warmer waters and an environment with less vertical wind shear.20 an example of this happening is in the 1991 perfect storm.21 the process known as tropical transition involves the usually slow development of an extratropically cold core vortex into a tropical cyclone.2223 the joint typhoon warning center uses the extratropical transition xt technique to subjectively estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones becoming extratropical based on visible and infrared satellite imagery loss of central convection in transitioning tropical cyclones can cause the dvorak technique to fail;24 the loss of convection results in unrealistically low estimates using the dvorak technique.25 the system combines aspects of the dvorak technique used for estimating tropical cyclone intensity and the hebert-poteat technique used for estimating subtropical cyclone intensity.26 the technique is applied when a tropical cyclone interacts with a frontal boundary or loses its central convection while maintaining its forward speed or accelerating.27 the xt scale corresponds to the dvorak scale and is applied in the same way except that xt is used instead of t to indicate that the system is undergoing extratropical transition.28 also the xt technique is only used once extratropical transition begins the dvorak technique is still used if the system begins dissipating without transition.27 once the cyclone has completed transition and become cold-core the technique is no longer used.28 structureedit surface pressure and wind distributionedit the windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with distance in relation to surface level pressure with the lowest pressure being found near the center and the highest winds typically just on the cold/poleward side of warm fronts occlusions and cold fronts where the pressure gradient force is highest.29 the area poleward and west of the cold and warm fronts connected to extratropical cyclones is known as the cold sector while the area equatorward and east of its associated cold and warm fronts is known as the warm sector the wind flow around an extratropical cyclone is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere due to the coriolis effect this manner of rotation is generally referred to as cyclonic near this center the pressure gradient force from the pressure at the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone and the coriolis force must be in an approximate balance for the cyclone to avoid collapsing in on itself as a result of the difference in pressure.30 the central pressure of the cyclone will lower with increasing maturity while outside of the cyclone the sea-level pressure is about average in most extratropical cyclones the part of the cold front ahead of the cyclone will develop into a warm front giving the frontal zone as drawn on surface weather maps a wave-like shape due to their appearance on satellite images extratropical cyclones can also be referred to as frontal waves early in their life cycle in the united states an old name for such a system is warm wave.31 vertical structureedit cyclone evolutionedit norwegian cyclone modeledit of the two theories on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle the older is the norwegian cyclone model developed during world war i in this theory cyclones develop as they move up and along a frontal boundary eventually occluding and reaching a barotropically cold environment.37 it was developed completely from surface-based weather observations including descriptions of clouds found near frontal boundaries this theory still retains merit as it is a good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses shapiro-keyser modeledit a second competing theory for extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the shapiro-keyser model developed in 1990.38 its main differences with the norwegian cyclone model are the fracture of the cold front treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front this model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest atlantic warm seclusionedit a warm seclusion is the mature phase of the extratropical cyclone lifecycle this was conceptualized after the erica field experiment of the late 1980s which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure secluded or surrounded by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds.39 the norwegian cyclone model as developed by the bergen school of meteorology largely observed cyclones at the tail end of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages as latent heat flux releases are important for their development and intensification most warm seclusion events occur over the oceans they may impact coastal nations with hurricane force winds and torrential rain.3840 climatologically the northern hemisphere sees warm seclusions during the cold season months while the southern hemisphere may see a strong cyclone event such as this during all times of the year in all tropical basins except the northern indian ocean the extratropical transition of a tropical cyclone may result in reintensification into a warm seclusion for example hurricane maria of 2005 reintensified into a strong baroclinic system and achieved warm seclusion status at maturity or lowest pressure.41 motionedit extratropical cyclones are generally driven or steered by deep westerly winds in a general west to east motion across both the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth this general motion of atmospheric flow is known as zonal.42 where this general trend is the main steering influence of an extratropical cyclone it is known as a zonal flow regime when the general flow pattern buckles from a zonal pattern to the meridional pattern43 a slower movement in a north or southward direction is more likely meridional flow patterns feature strong amplified troughs and ridges generally with more northerly and southerly flow changes in direction of this nature are most commonly observed as a result of a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems troughs ridges or with anticyclones a strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone such blocking patterns are quite normal and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone the weakening of the anticyclone a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions it is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.44 where an extratropical cyclone encounters another extratropical cyclone or almost any other kind of cyclonic vortex in the atmosphere the two may combine to become a binary cyclone where the vortices of the two cyclones rotate around each other known as the fujiwhara effect this most often results in a merging of the two low pressure systems into a single extratropical cyclone or can less commonly result in a mere change of direction of either one or both of the cyclones.45 the precise results of such interactions depend on factors such as the size of the two cyclones their strength their distance from each other and the prevailing atmospheric conditions around them effectsedit generaledit severe weatheredit squall lines or solid bands of strong thunderstorms can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs due to the presence of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence leading to hail and high winds.47 when significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front in the presence of a strong upper level jet stream tornado formation is possible.48 although tornadoes can form anywhere on earth the greatest number occur in the great plains in the united states because downsloped winds off the north-south oriented rocky mountains which can form a dryline aid their development at any strength climate and general circulationedit in the classic analysis by edward lorenz the lorenz energy cycle53 extratropical cyclones so-called atmospheric transients acts as a mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy in the process the pole-equator temperature gradient is reduced i.e energy is transported poleward to warm up the higher latitudes historic

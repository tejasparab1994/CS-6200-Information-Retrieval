effects of global warming the effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused directly or indirectly by human emissions of greenhouse gases there is a scientific consensus that climate change is occurring and that human activities are the primary driver.1 many impacts of climate change have already been observed including glacier retreat2 changes in the timing of seasonal events2 e.g. earlier flowering of plants3 and changes in agricultural productivity.2 future effects of climate change will vary depending on climate change policies4 and social development.5 the two main policies to address climate change are reducing human greenhouse gas emissions climate change mitigation and adapting to the impacts of climate change.6 geoengineering is another policy option.6  contents  definitions in this article climate change means a change in climate that persists over a sustained period of time.1415 the world meteorological organization defines this time period as 30 years.14 examples of climate change include increases in global surface temperature global warming changes in rainfall patterns and changes in the frequency of extreme weather events changes in climate may be due to natural causes e.g. changes in the sun's output or due to human activities e.g. changing the composition of the atmosphere.16 any human-induced changes in climate will occur against a background of natural climatic variations16 and of variations in human activity such as population growth on shores or in arid areas which increase or decrease climate vulnerability.17 also the term anthropogenic forcing refers to the influence exerted on a habitat or chemical environment by humans as opposed to a natural process.18 temperature changes sres emissions scenarios over the next several millennia projections suggest that global warming could be irreversible.32 even if emissions were drastically reduced global temperatures would remain close to their highest level for at least 1000 years see the later section on irreversibilities.3334 projected warming in context physical impacts a broad range of evidence shows that the climate system has warmed.42 evidence of global warming is shown in the graphs opposite some of the graphs show a positive trend e.g. increasing temperature over land and the ocean and sea level rise other graphs show a negative trend e.g. decreased snow cover in the northern hemisphere and declining arctic sea ice extent evidence of warming is also apparent in living biological systems.43 human activities have contributed to a number of the observed changes in climate.44 this contribution has principally been through the burning of fossil fuels which has led to an increase in the concentration of ghgs in the atmosphere.45 another human influence on the climate are sulfur dioxide emissions which are a precursor to the formation of sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere.46 human-induced warming could lead to large-scale irreversible and/or abrupt changes in physical systems.4748 an example of this is the melting of ice sheets which contributes to sea level rise.49 the probability of warming having unforeseen consequences increases with the rate magnitude and duration of climate change.50 effects on weather observations show that there have been changes in weather.51 as climate changes the probabilities of certain types of weather events are affected changes have been observed in the amount intensity frequency and type of precipitation.23:18 widespread increases in heavy precipitation have occurred even in places where total rain amounts have decreased with medium confidence see footnote 1 ipcc 201254 concluded that human influences had contributed to an increase in heavy precipitation events at the global scale projections of future changes in precipitation show overall increases in the global average but with substantial shifts in where and how precipitation falls.23:24 projections suggest a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions.53 in other words regions which are dry at present will in general become even drier while regions that are currently wet will in general become even wetter.53 this projection does not apply to every locale and in some cases can be modified by local conditions.53 extreme weather over most land areas since the 1950s it is very likely that there have been fewer or warmer cold days and nights.55 hot days and nights have also very likely become warmer or more frequent.55 human activities have very likely contributed to these trends.55 there may have been changes in other climate extremes e.g. floods droughts and tropical cyclones but these changes are more difficult to identify.55 projections suggest changes in the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events.55 confidence in projections varies over time.55 some changes e.g. more frequent hot days will probably be evident in the near term while other near-term changes e.g. more intense droughts and tropical cyclones are more uncertain.55 future climate change will be associated with more very hot days and fewer very cold days.55 the frequency length and intensity of heat waves will very likely increase over most land areas.55 higher growth in anthropogenic ghg emissions will be associated with larger increases in the frequency and severity of temperature extremes.56 assuming high growth in ghg emissions ipcc scenario rcp8.5 presently dry regions may be affected by an increase in the risk of drought and reductions in soil moisture.57 over most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropical regions extreme precipitation events will very likely become more intense and frequent.55 at the global scale the frequency of tropical cyclones will probably decrease or be unchanged.58 global mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed and precipitation rates will likely increase.58 changes in tropical cyclones will probably vary by region but these variations are uncertain.58 cryosphere the cryosphere is made up of areas of the earth which are covered by snow or ice.62 observed changes in the cryosphere include declines in arctic sea ice extent63 the widespread retreat of alpine glaciers64 and reduced snow cover in the northern hemisphere.65 during the 21st century glaciers68 and snow cover are projected to continue their widespread retreat.69 in the western mountains of north america increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation are projected to lead to reduced snowpack.70 snowpack is the seasonal accumulation of slow-melting snow.71 the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets could contribute to sea level rise especially over long time-scales see the section on greenland and west antarctic ice sheets.49 changes in the cryosphere are projected to have social impacts.72 for example in some regions glacier retreat could increase the risk of reductions in seasonal water availability.73 barnett et al 200574 estimated that more than one-sixth of the world's population rely on glaciers and snowpack for their water supply oceans global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets and warming of the ocean surface leading to increased temperature stratification other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation acidification about one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activity has already been taken up by the oceans.78 as carbon dioxide dissolves in sea water carbonic acid is formed which has the effect of acidifying the ocean measured as a change in ph the uptake of human carbon emissions since the year 1750 has led to an average decrease in ph of 0.1 units.79 projections using the sres emissions scenarios suggest a further reduction in average global surface ocean ph of between 0.14 and 0.35 units over the 21st century the effects of ocean acidification on the marine biosphere have yet to be documented.79 laboratory experiments suggest beneficial effects for a few species with potentially highly detrimental effects for a substantial number of species.78 with medium confidence fischlin et al 200780 projected that future ocean acidification and climate change would impair a wide range of planktonic and shallow benthic marine organisms that use aragonite to make their shells or skeletons such as corals and marine snails pteropods with significant impacts particularly in the southern ocean oxygen depletion the amount of oxygen dissolved in the oceans may decline with adverse consequences for ocean life.8182 sea level rise there are two main factors that have contributed to observed sea level rise.84 the first is thermal expansion as ocean water warms it expands.86 the second is from the contribution of land-based ice due to increased melting the major store of water on land is found in glaciers and ice sheets anthropogenic forces very likely greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement29 contributed to sea level rise during the latter half of the 20th century.44 an assessment of the scientific literature on climate change was published in 2010 by the us national research council us nrc 2010.91 nrc 201091 described the projections in ar4 i.e those cited in the above paragraph as conservative and summarized the results of more recent studies cited studies suggested a great deal of uncertainty in projections.91 a range of projections suggested possible sea level rise by the end of the 21st century of between 0.56 and 2 m relative to sea levels at the end of the 20th century.91 ocean temperature rise regions regional effects of global warming vary in nature some are the result of a generalised global change such as rising temperature resulting in local effects such as melting ice in other cases a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system in such cases the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend there are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate melting or forming ice changing the hydrological cycle of evaporation and precipitation and changing currents in the oceans and air flows in the atmosphere the coast can also be considered a region and will suffer severe impacts from sea level rise observed impacts with very high confidence rosenzweig et al 200743 concluded that physical and biological systems on all continents and in most oceans had been affected by recent climate changes particularly regional temperature increases impacts include earlier leafing of trees and plants over many regions movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes in the northern hemisphere changes in bird migrations in europe north america and australia and shifting of the oceans plankton and fish from cold to warm-adapted communities.95 the human influence on the climate can be seen in the geographical pattern of observed warming with greater temperature increases over land and in polar regions rather than over the oceans.96:6 using models it is possible to identify the human signal of global warming over both land and ocean areas.96:6 projected impacts projections of future climate changes at the regional scale do not hold as high a level of scientific confidence as projections made at the global scale.96:9 it is however expected that future warming will follow a similar geographical pattern to that seen already with greatest warming over land and high northern latitudes and least over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic ocean.97 nearly all land areas will very likely warm more than the global average.98 the arctic africa small islands and asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by climate change.99 low-latitude less-developed areas are at most risk of experiencing negative impacts due to climate change.100 developed countries are also vulnerable to climate change.101 for example developed countries will be negatively affected by increases in the severity and frequency of some extreme weather events such as heat waves.101 in all regions some people can be particularly at risk from climate change such as the poor young children and the elderly.99100102 social systems the impacts of climate change can be thought of in terms of sensitivity and vulnerability sensitivity is the degree to which a particular system or sector might be affected positively or negatively by climate change and/or climate variability vulnerability is the degree to which a particular system or sector might be adversely affected by climate change.103 the sensitivity of human society to climate change varies sectors sensitive to climate change include water resources coastal zones human settlements and human health industries sensitive to climate change include agriculture fisheries forestry energy construction insurance financial services tourism and recreation.104105 food supply climate change will impact agriculture and food production around the world due to the effects of elevated co2 in the atmosphere higher temperatures altered precipitation and transpiration regimes increased frequency of extreme events and modified weed pest and pathogen pressure.106 in general low-latitude areas are at most risk of having decreased crop yields.107 as of 2007 the effects of regional climate change on agriculture have been small.43 changes in crop phenology provide important evidence of the response to recent regional climate change.108 phenology is the study of natural phenomena that recur periodically and how these phenomena relate to climate and seasonal changes.109 a significant advance in phenology has been observed for agriculture and forestry in large parts of the northern hemisphere.43 projections most of the studies on global agriculture assessed by schneider et al 2007107 had not incorporated a number of critical factors including changes in extreme events or the spread of pests and diseases studies had also not considered the development of specific practices or technologies to aid adaptation to climate change.107 the graphs opposite show the projected effects of climate change on selected crop yields.111 actual changes in yields may be above or below these central estimates.111 droughts and agriculture some evidence suggests that droughts have been occurring more frequently because of global warming and they are expected to become more frequent and intense in africa southern europe the middle east most of the americas australia and southeast asia.115 however other research suggests that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.116 their impacts are aggravated because of increased water demand population growth urban expansion and environmental protection efforts in many areas.117 droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture grazing land for livestock.118 health human beings are exposed to climate change through changing weather patterns temperature precipitation sea-level rise and more frequent extreme events and indirectly through changes in water air and food quality and changes in ecosystems agriculture industry and settlements and the economy confalonieri et al. 2007:393.59 according to an assessment of the scientific literature by confalonieri et al 2007:39359 the effects of climate change to date have been small but are projected to progressively increase in all countries and regions a study by the world health organization who 2009119 estimated the effect of climate change on human health not all of the effects of climate change were included in their estimates for example the effects of more frequent and extreme storms were excluded climate change was estimated to have been responsible for 3 of diarrhoea 3 of malaria and 3.8 of dengue fever deaths worldwide in 2004 total attributable mortality was about 0.2 of deaths in 2004 of these 85 were child deaths projections with high confidence authors of the ipcc ar4 synthesis report120:48 projected that climate change would bring some benefits in temperate areas such as fewer deaths from cold exposure and some mixed effects such as changes in range and transmission potential of malaria in africa benefits were projected to be outweighed by negative health effects of rising temperatures especially in developing countries with very high confidence confalonieri et al 200759:393 concluded that economic development was an important component of possible adaptation to climate change economic growth on its own however was not judged to be sufficient to insulate the world's population from disease and injury due to climate change future vulnerability to climate change will depend not only on the extent of social and economic change but also on how the benefits and costs of change are distributed in society.121 for example in the 19th century rapid urbanization in western europe lead to a plummeting in population health.121 other factors important in determining the health of populations include education the availability of health services and public-health infrastructure.59:393 water resources a number of climate-related trends have been observed that affect water resources these include changes in precipitation the crysosphere and surface waters e.g. changes in river flows.122 observed and projected impacts of climate change on freshwater systems and their management are mainly due to changes in temperature sea level and precipitation variability.123 sea level rise will extend areas of salinization of groundwater and estuaries resulting in a decrease in freshwater availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas in an assessment of the scientific literature kundzewicz et al 2007123 concluded with high confidence that migration and conflict general circulation models project that the future climate change will bring wetter coasts drier mid-continent areas and further sea level rise.124 such changes could result in the gravest effects of climate change through human migration.125 millions might be displaced by shoreline erosions river and coastal flooding or severe drought migration related to climate change is likely to be predominantly from rural areas in developing countries to towns and cities.124:407126 in the short term climate stress is likely to add incrementally to existing migration patterns rather than generating entirely new flows of people.126:110 it has been argued that environmental degradation loss of access to resources e.g. water resources127 and resulting human migration could become a source of political and even military conflict.128 factors other than climate change may however be more important in affecting conflict for example wilbanks et al 2007129 suggested that major environmentally influenced conflicts in africa were more to do with the relative abundance of resources e.g. oil and diamonds than with resource scarcity scott et al 2001 placed only low confidence in predictions of increased conflict due to climate change.128 a 2013 study found that significant climatic changes were associated with a higher risk of conflict worldwide and predicted that amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low and high-income countries.130 similarly a 2014 study found that higher temperatures were associated with a greater likelihood of violent crime and predicted that global warming would cause millions of such crimes in the united states alone during the 21st century.131 military planners are concerned that global warming is a threat multiplier whether it is poverty food and water scarcity diseases economic instability or threat of natural disasters the broad range of changing climatic conditions may be far reaching these challenges may threaten stability in much of the world.132 aggregate impacts aggregating impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and/or regions.133 examples of aggregate measures include economic cost e.g. changes in gross domestic product gdp and the social cost of carbon changes in ecosystems e.g. changes over land area from one type of vegetation to another134 human health impacts and the number of people affected by climate change.135 aggregate measures such as economic cost require researchers to make value judgements over the importance of impacts occurring in different regions and at different times observed impacts global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather-related events since the 1970s.136 socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses e.g. population growth increased wealth.137 part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors e.g. changes in precipitation and flooding events it is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend.137 the trend does however suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate change.137138 projected impacts aggregate impacts have also been quantified in non-economic terms for example climate change over the 21st century is likely to adversely affect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal flooding reductions in water supplies increased malnutrition and increased health impacts.61 biological systems observed impacts on biological systems with very high confidence rosenzweig et al 2007 concluded that recent warming had strongly affected natural biological systems.43 hundreds of studies have documented responses of ecosystems plants and animals to the climate changes that have already occurred.143 for example in the northern hemisphere species are almost uniformly moving their ranges northward and up in elevation in search of cooler temperatures.144 humans are very likely causing changes in regional temperatures to which plants and animals are responding.144 projected impacts on biological systems by the year 2100 ecosystems will be exposed to atmospheric co2 levels substantially higher than in the past 650000 years and global temperatures at least among the highest of those experienced in the past 740000 years.145 significant disruptions of ecosystems are projected to increase with future climate change.146 examples of disruptions include disturbances such as fire drought pest infestation invasion of species storms and coral bleaching events the stresses caused by climate change added to other stresses on ecological systems e.g. land conversion land degradation harvesting and pollution threaten substantial damage to or complete loss of some unique ecosystems and extinction of some critically endangered species.146147 climate change has been estimated to be a major driver of biodiversity loss in cool conifer forests savannas mediterranean-climate systems tropical forests in the arctic tundra and in coral reefs.148 in other ecosystems land-use change may be a stronger driver of biodiversity loss at least in the near-term.148 beyond the year 2050 climate change may be the major driver for biodiversity loss globally.148 abrupt or irreversible changes physical ecological and social systems may respond in an abrupt non-linear or irregular way to climate change.153 this is as opposed to a smooth or regular response a quantitative entity behaves irregularly when its dynamics are discontinuous i.e. not smooth nondifferentiable unbounded wildly varying or otherwise ill-defined.153 such behaviour is often termed singular irregular behaviour in earth systems may give rise to certain thresholds which when crossed may lead to a large change in the system some singularities could potentially lead to severe impacts at regional or global scales.154 examples of large-scale singularities are discussed in the articles on abrupt climate change climate change feedback and runaway climate change it is possible that human-induced climate change could trigger large-scale singularities but the probabilities of triggering such events are for the most part155 poorly understood.154 biogeochemical cycles climate change may have an effect on the carbon cycle in an interactive feedback process a feedback exists where an initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn influences the initial process a positive feedback intensifies the original process and a negative feedback reduces it.120:78 models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive.156:792 greenland and west antarctic ice sheets atlantic meridional overturning circulation the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc is an important component of the earth's climate system characterized by a northward flow of warm salty water in the upper layers of the atlantic and a southward flow of colder water in the deep atlantic.158:5 the amoc is equivalently known as the thermohaline circulation thc.141 potential impacts associated with moc changes include reduced warming or in the case of abrupt change absolute cooling of northern high-latitude areas near greenland and north-western europe an increased warming of southern hemisphere high-latitudes tropical drying as well as changes to marine ecosystems terrestrial vegetation oceanic co2 uptake oceanic oxygen concentrations and shifts in fisheries.159 according to an assessment by the us climate change science program ccsp 2008b158:5 it is very likely greater than 90 probability based on expert judgement158:12 that the strength of the amoc will decrease over the course of the 21st century warming is still expected to occur over most of the european region downstream of the north atlantic current in response to increasing ghgs as well as over north america although it is very unlikely less than 10 probability based on expert judgement158:12 that the amoc will collapse in the 21st century the potential consequences of such a collapse could be severe.158:5 irreversibilities commitment to radiative forcing emissions of ghgs are a potentially irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing in the future.160 the contribution of a ghg to radiative forcing depends on the gas's ability to trap infrared heat radiation the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere and the length of time the gas resides in the atmosphere.160 co2 is the most important anthropogenic ghg.161 while more than half of the co2 emitted is currently removed from the atmosphere within a century some fraction about 20% of emitted co2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.162 consequently co2 emitted today is potentially an irreversible commitment to sustained radiative forcing over thousands of years this commitment may not be truly irreversible should techniques be developed to remove co2 or other ghgs directly from the atmosphere or to block sunlight to induce cooling.32 techniques of this sort are referred to as geoengineering little is known about the effectiveness costs or potential side-effects of geoengineering options.163 some geoengineering options such as blocking sunlight would not prevent further ocean acidification.163 irreversible impacts human-induced climate change may lead to irreversible impacts on physical biological and social systems.164 there are a number of examples of climate change impacts that may be irreversible at least over the timescale of many human generations.165 these include the large-scale singularities described above  changes in carbon cycle feedbacks the melting of the greenland and west antarctic ice sheets and changes to the amoc.165 in biological systems the extinction of species would be an irreversible impact.165 in social systems unique cultures may be lost due to climate change.165 for example humans living on atoll islands face risks due to sea-level rise sea-surface warming and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.166 benefits of global warming in some locations and industries global warming may increase productivity though the ipcc cautions that estimates agree on the size of the impact small relative to economic growth and 17 of the 20 impact estimates shown in figure 10-1 are negative losses accelerate with greater warming and estimates diverge.167 the identified benefits are listed below co2 fertilisation effect co2 is one of the substances which plants require to grow increasing its amount in the air contributes to human health ice-free northwest passage animal population changes some animals will benefit from the warming scientific opinion the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has published several major assessments on the effects of global warming.179 its most recent comprehensive impact assessment was published in 2014.180 publications describing the effects of climate change have also been produced by the following organizations a report by molina et al no date188 states the overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systems nasa data and tools see also footnotes 1 the tar190 and ar429 that are referred to in this article use specific and quantitative language to describe uncertainty this language is intended to provide an indication of the level of confidence that ipcc authors have about a particular finding the qualitative language used to describe uncertainty has a quantitative scale associated with it the quantitative values for qualitative terms are intended to ensure that confidence levels are interpreted correctly the is because qualitative statements e.g. using the word likely can be interpreted differently in quantitative terms.191:44 confidence levels used in the tar:192 confidence statements made in ar4 are listed below:29 ipcc 2012193 uses the following terms very low low medium high and very high confidence unlike the tar and ar4 the scale is qualitative rather than quantitative the quantitative values used by ipcc authors are subjective probabilities29190194 also known as personalist or bayesian probabilities195 and reflect the expert judgement of ipcc authors in this formulation probability is not only a function of an event but also the state of information that is available to the person making the assessment.195 in this framework assigned probabilities may change as more or different information becomes available.195 the ipcc also uses another scale to describe the likelihood of a particular event occurring.29 this is different from the confidence scales described above and it is possible to assign confidence values to statements of likelihood for example the judgement that an event is improbable e.g. rolling a dice twice and getting a six both times may be assigned a high level of scientific confidence.29 also the probability that an event has an even chance of occurring e.g. a tossed coin coming up heads may also be assigned a high level of confidence.29 notes  references further reading external links navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

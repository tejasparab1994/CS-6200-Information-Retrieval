united states geological survey the united states geological survey usgs formerly simply geological survey is a scientific agency of the united states government the scientists of the usgs study the landscape of the united states its natural resources and the natural hazards that threaten it the organization has four major science disciplines concerning biology geography geology and hydrology the usgs is a fact-finding research organization with no regulatory responsibility the usgs is a bureau of the united states department of the interior it is that department's sole scientific agency the usgs employs approximately 8670 people2 and is headquartered in reston virginia the usgs also has major offices near lakewood colorado at the denver federal center and menlo park california the current motto of the usgs in use since august 1997 is science for a changing world.34 the agency's previous slogan adopted on the occasion of its hundredth anniversary was earth science in the public service.5  contents  historyedit the legislation also provided that the hayden powell and wheeler surveys be discontinued as of june 30 1879.6 clarence king the first director of usgs assembled the new organization from disparate regional survey agencies after a short tenure king was succeeded in the director's chair by john wesley powell list of usgs directorsedit programsedit since 2012 the usgs science focus is directed at six topical mission areas7 namely 1 climate and land use change 2 core science systems 3 ecosystems 4 energy and minerals and environmental health 5 natural hazards and 6 water in december 2012 the usgs split the energy and minerals and environmental health mission area resulting in seven topical mission areas with the two new areas being energy and minerals and environmental health administratively it is divided into a headquarters unit and six regional units.8 other specific programs include topographic mappingedit the next-smallest topographic series in terms of scale is the 1:100000 series these maps are bounded by two lines of longitude and two lines of latitude however in this series the lines of latitude are spaced 30 minutes apart and the lines of longitude are spaced 60 minutes which is the source of another name for these maps the 30 x 60-minute quadrangle series each of these quadrangles covers the area contained within 32 maps in the 7.5-minute series the 1:100000 scale series is unusual in that it employs the metric system primarily one centimeter on the map represents one kilometer of distance on the ground contour intervals spot elevations and horizontal distances are also specified in meters usgs topographic quadrangle maps are marked with grid lines and tics around the map collar which make it possible to identify locations on the map by several methods including the graticule measurements of longitude and latitude the township and section method within the public land survey system and cartesian coordinates in both the state plane coordinate system and the universal transverse mercator coordinate system other specialty maps have been produced by the usgs at a variety of scales these include county maps maps of special interest areas such as the national parks and areas of scientific interest the national map and u.s topoedit in 2008 the usgs abandoned traditional methods of surveying revising and updating topographic maps based on aerial photography and field checks.26 today's u.s topo quadrangle 1:24000 maps are mass-produced using automated and semiautomated processes with cartographic content supplied from the national gis database.26 in the two years from june 2009 to may 2011 the usgs produced nearly 40000 maps more than 80 maps per work day.26 only about two hours of interactive work are spent on each map mostly on text placement and final inspection there are essentially no field checks or field inspections to confirm map details.26 while much less expensive to compile and produce the revised digital u.s topo maps have been criticized for a lack of accuracy and detail in comparison to older generation maps based on aerial photo survey and field checks.26 as the digital databases were not designed for producing general purpose maps data integration can be a problem when retrieved from sources with different resolutions and collection dates.26 man-made features once recorded by direct field observation are not in any public domain national database and are frequently omitted from the newest generation digital topo maps including windmills mines and mineshafts water tanks fence lines survey marks parks recreational trails buildings boundaries pipelines telephone lines power transmission lines and even railroads.26 additionally the digital map's use of existing software may not properly integrate different feature classes or prioritize and organize text in areas of crowded features obscuring important geographic details.26 as a result some have noted that the u.s topo maps currently fall short of traditional topographic map presentation standards achieved in maps drawn from 1945 to 1992.26 usgs hydrologic instrumentation facilityedit the hydrologic instrumentation facility hif has four sections within its organizational structure;27 the field services section which includes the warehouse repair shop and engineering unit the testing section which includes the hydraulic laboratory testing chambers and water quality laboratory the information technology section which includes computer support and the drafting unit and the administrative section the hif was given national responsibility for the design testing evaluation repair calibration warehousing and distribution of hydrologic instrumentation distribution is accomplished by direct sales and through a rental program the hif supports data collection activities through centralized warehouse and laboratory facilities the hif warehouse provides hydrologic instruments equipment and supplies for usgs as well as other federal agencies ofa and usgs cooperators the hif also tests evaluates repairs calibrates and develops hydrologic equipment and instruments the hif hydraulic laboratory facilities include a towing tank jet tank pipe flow facility and tilting flume in addition the hif provides training and technical support for the equipment it stocks the engineering group seeks out new technology and designs for instrumentation that can work more efficiently be more accurate and or be produced at a lower cost than existing instrumentation hif works directly with vendors to help them produce products that will meet the mission needs of the usgs for instrument needs not currently met by a vendor the engineering group designs tests and issues contracts to have hif designed equipment made sometimes hif will patent a new design in the hope that instrument vendors will buy the rights and mass-produce the instrument at a lower cost to everyone usgs publicationsedit usgs researchers publish the results of their science in a variety of ways many researchers publish their science in peer-reviewed scientific journals as well as in one of a variety of series that includes series for preliminary results maps data and final results these series include a complete listing of descriptions of usgs series is available at the alaska division of geological  geophysical surveys adggs website.28 locating usgs publicationsedit the united states geological survey library holds copies of current and historical usgs publications and is the largest earth sciences library in the world most publications are available for inter-library loan within the united states under the organic act which provided for the formation of the usgs the library was given extra copies of all usgs publications when published to be used in exchange with other domestic and foreign geological agencies making the acquisition of the usgs library collection one of the most cost efficient libraries in the u.s government usgs publications are available for purchase at usgs store.29 many usgs published reports are available to view and access on-line from the usgs publications warehouse30 while many usgs publications are now available online see publications below many older usgs publications have been scanned and digitized by such services as google books and

tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting  contents  rainfall distribution around a tropical cycloneedit vertical wind shearedit vertical wind shear forces the rainfall pattern around a tropical cyclone to become highly asymmetric with most of the precipitation falling to the left and downwind of the shear vector or downshear left in other words southwesterly shear forces the bulk of the rainfall north-northeast of the center.9 if the wind shear is strong enough the bulk of the rainfall will move away from the center leading to what is known as an exposed circulation center when this occurs the potential magnitude of rainfall with the tropical cyclone will be significantly reduced interaction with frontal boundaries and upper level troughsedit mountainsedit moist air forced up the slopes of coastal hills and mountain chains can lead to much heavier rainfall than in the coastal plain.12 this heavy rainfall can lead to landslides which still cause significant loss of life such as seen during hurricane mitch in central america where several thousand perished.13 tools used in preparation of forecastedit climatology and persistenceedit numerical weather predictionedit kraft ruleedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

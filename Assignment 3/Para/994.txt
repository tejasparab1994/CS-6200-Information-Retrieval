salyut programme salyut flights broke several spaceflight records including several mission-duration records and achieved the first ever orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another and various spacewalk records the ensuing soyuz program was vital for evolving space station technology from a basic engineering development stage from single docking port stations to complex multi-ported long-term orbital outposts with impressive scientific capabilities whose technological legacy continues to the present dayupdate experience gained from the salyut stations paved the way for multimodular space stations such as mir and the international space station iss with each of those stations possessing a salyut-derived core module at its heart mir-2 dos-8 the final spacecraft from the salyut series became one of the first modules of the iss the first module of the iss the russian-made zarya relied heavily on technologies developed in the salyut programme  contents  history of salyut space stationsedit the program was composed of dos durable orbital station civilian stations and ops orbital piloted station military stations when it was realized that the later civilian dos stations could not only offer a cover story for the military almaz programme but could be finished within one year and at least a year earlier than almaz the salyut programme begun on 15 february 1970  under the condition that the manned lunar program would not suffer.2 however the engineers at okb-1 immediately switched from the l3 lunar lander effort which was perceived as a dead-end to start work on dos  despite fears that it would kill the soviet manned moon shot.3 in the end it turned out that the soviet n1 moon shot rocket never flew successfully so okb-1's decisions to abandon the ill-fated soviet manned lunar program and to derive a dos space station from existing soyuz subsystems and an almaz/ops hull proved to be right the actual time from the dos station's inception to the launch of the first dos-based salyut 1 space station took only 16 months the world's first space station was launched by the soviet union two years before the american skylab or the first almaz/ops station flew initially the space stations were to be named zarya the russian word for 'dawn' however as the launch of the first station in the programme was prepared it was realised that this would conflict with the call sign zarya of the flight control centre tsup in korolyov  therefore the name of the space stations was changed to salyut shortly before launch of salyut 1.34 another explanation given is that the name might have offended the chinese who purportedly were preparing a new rocket for launch which they had already named dawn.5 the salyut programme was managed by kerim kerimov6 chairman of the state commission for soyuz missions.7 while a total of nine space stations were launched in the salyut programme with six successfully manned setting some records along the way it was the stations salyut 6 and salyut 7 that became the workhorses of the program out of the total of 1697 days of occupancy that all salyut crews achieved salyut 6 and 7 accounted for 1499 while skylab already featured a second docking port these two salyut stations became the first that actually utilized two docking ports this made it possible for two soyuz spacecraft to dock at the same time for crew exchange of the station and for progress spacecraft to resupply the station allowing for the first time a continuous permanent occupation of space stations the heritage of the salyut programme continued to live on in the first multi-module space station mir with the mir core module dos-7 that accumulated 4592 days of occupancy and in the international space station iss with the zvezda module dos-8 that as of 21 august 2012update accumulated 4310 days of occupancy furthermore the functional cargo block space station modules were derived from the almaz programme with the zarya iss module being still in operation together with zvezda first generation  the first space stationsedit salyut 1 dos-1edit its first crew launched in soyuz 10 but were unable to board due to a failure in the docking mechanism its second crew launched in soyuz 11 and remained on board for 23 productive days the world's first successful manned space station mission was however overshadowed when the crew was killed before the re-entry of soyuz 11 on 30 june 1971  a pressure equalisation valve in the descent module of the soyuz had opened prematurely when the three modules of the spacecraft separated suffocating all three salyut 1 was moved to a higher orbit between july and august 1971 to ensure that it would not be destroyed prematurely through orbital decay in the meantime soyuz capsules were being substantially re-designed to allow pressure suits to be worn during launch docking maneuvers and re-entry.8 however salyut 1 ran out of supplies before the soyuz redesign effort was concluded and it was decided to fire the engines for the last time on 11 october to lower its orbit and ensure prompt destructive re-entry over the pacific ocean after 175 days in space the first real space station came to an end dos-2edit dos-2 was launched on 29 july 1972 it was similar in design to salyut 1 the second stage of its proton rocket failed dos-2 never reached orbit and crashed into the pacific ocean salyut 2 ops-1 militaryedit kosmos 557 dos-3edit the module dos-3 was launched on 11 may 1973  three days before the launch of skylab  and was slated to become the next civilian space station with a salyut designation due to errors in the flight control system while out of range from ground control the station fired its orbital-correction engines until it consumed all of its fuel since the spacecraft was already in orbit and had been registered by western radar the soviets disguised the launch as kosmos 557  it was revealed to have been a salyut station only much later it re-entered earth's atmosphere a week later and burned up on re-entry salyut 3 ops-2 militaryedit salyut 4 dos-4edit salyut 5 ops-3 militaryedit following salyut 5 the soviet military decided that with the advent of more sophisticated spy satellites the tactical advantages were not worth the expense of the program and withdrew from the programme the focuses for the last two salyut stations shifted towards civilian research and prestige for the soviet union second generation  long-duration inhabitation of spaceedit in 1977 another marked step forward was made with the second generation of salyut stations the aim was to continuously occupy a space station with long-duration expeditions for the first time in spaceflight although salyut 6 and salyut 7 resembled the previous salyut stations in overall design several revolutionary changes were made to the stations and program for the aim of continuous occupation the new stations featured a longer design life and a second docking port at the aft of the stations  crew exchanges and station handovers were now made possible by docking two crewed soyuz spacecraft at the same time furthermore the uncrewed progress resupply craft was created based on the crewed soyuz to resupply the crew and station with air air regenerators water food clothing bedding mail propellants pressurant and other supplies while the progress docked to the station's second docking port the crew's soyuz spacecraft could remain docked to the station's first port the progress spacecraft even delivered hardware for updating onboard experiments and permitting repairs to the station extending its life.10 salyut 6 dos-5edit after salyut 6 manned operations were discontinued in 1981 a heavy unmanned spacecraft called tks developed using hardware left from the canceled almaz programme was docked to the station as a hardware test some unconfirmed reports saywho? the station was functionally capable of even more missions but combating the ever-increasing mold in living quarters was becoming impossible and in practice caused the retirement decision salyut 6 was deorbited on 29 july 1982 salyut 7 dos-6edit on 12 february 1985 during an unmanned period contact with salyut 7 was lost the station had become crippled by electrical problems all systems shut down and the station began to drift it was decided to put together a salvage mission and on june 1985 the soyuz t-13 mission in what was in the words of author david s f portree one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history managed to bring the station online again.10 the soyuz t-15 mission was the last to visit salyut 7 in 1986 ferrying equipment from salyut 7 to the new mir space station this was so far the only ferry flight between two space stations aside from the many experiments and observations made on salyut 7 the station also tested the docking and use of large modules with an orbiting space station these modules called heavy cosmos modules helped engineers develop technology necessary to build mir salyut 7 was deorbited on 7 february 1991 salyut's heritage  modular space stationsedit after the second generation plans for the next generation of salyut stations called for the cores dos-7 and dos-8 to allow for the first time in spaceflight the addition of several modules to a station core and to create a modular space station.citation needed for this the dos modules were to be equipped with a total of four docking ports one docking port at the aft of the station as in the second generation salyuts and the replacement of the front docking port with a docking sphere containing a front port and starboard docking port.citation needed while the station cores dos-7 and dos-8 were built and flown they never received the salyut designation instead dos-7 evolved into the mir core module for the mir space station that followed the salyut programme and dos-8 was used as the zvezda service module for the international space station iss which followed mir the heritage from the almaz program is present even today while the last space station from the almaz programme was flown as salyut 5 in 1976 the development of the almaz tks spacecraft evolved into the functional cargo block which formed the basis for several mir modules the experimental polyus orbital weapons platform and the zarya module of the iss.citation needed mir core module dos-7edit dos-7 continued to be developed during salyut 7 becoming the mir core module of the mir space station  the first modular space station with crewed operations lasting from 1986 to 2000 the station featured upgraded computers and solar arrays and accommodations for two cosmonauts each having their own cabin a total of six docking ports were available on the mir core module which were used for space station modules and visiting spacecraft  the docking sphere design had been upgraded from its initial salyut design to contain a maximum of five docking ports front port starboard zenith and nadir and finally the modules for mir were derived from the functional cargo block design of the almaz programme while the russian federation became the successor to much of the dissolved soviet union and was in a position to continue the soviet space program with the russian federal space agency it faced severe difficulties imports and exports had steeply declined as the economic exchange with comecon nations had crumbled away leaving the industry of the former soviet union in shambles not only did the political change in eastern europe signify an end of contributions to the space program by eastern european nations such as the east german carl zeiss jena but parts of the soviet space industry were located in the newly independent ukraine which was similarly cash-strapped as russia and started to demand hard currency for its contributions zvezda iss service module dos-8edit dos-8 evolved into the mir-2 project intended to replace mir finally it became the international space station iss zvezda service module and formed the core of the early iss together with the zarya module which was derived from almaz functional

drizzle  contents  effectsedit while most drizzle has only a minor immediate impact upon humans freezing drizzle can lead to treacherous conditions freezing drizzle occurs when supercooled drizzle drops land on a surface whose temperature is below freezing.3 these drops immediately freeze upon impact leading to the buildup of sheet ice sometimes called black ice on the surface of roads occurrenceedit drizzle tends to be the most frequent form of precipitation over large areas of the world's oceans particularly in the colder regions of the subtropics these regions are dominated by shallow marine stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus clouds which exist entirely within the marine boundary layer despite the low rates of surface accumulation it has become apparent that drizzle actually exerts a major influence over the cloud structure coverage and radiative properties in these regions this has motivated scientists to design more sophisticated sensitive instruments such as high frequency radars that can detect drizzle these studies have shown that the quantity of drizzle is strongly linked to cloud morphology and tends to be associated with updrafts within the marine boundary layer increased amounts of drizzle tend to be found in marine clouds that form in clean airmasses that have low concentrations of cloud droplets this interconnection between clouds and drizzle can be explored using high resolution numerical modelling such as large eddy simulation influence of aerosolsedit it has been hypothesized that increasing the amounts of particulates in the atmosphere through human activities may lead to a suppression of drizzle according to this hypothesis because drizzle can be an effective means of removing moisture from a cloud its suppression could help to increase the thickness coverage and longevity of marine stratocumulus clouds this would lead to increased cloud albedo on the regional to global scale and a cooling effect on the atmosphere estimates using complex global climate models suggest that this effect may be partially masking the effects of greenhouse gas increases on the global surface temperature however it is not clear that the representation of the chemical and physical processes needed to accurately simulate the interaction between aerosols clouds and drizzle in our current climate models is sufficient to fully understand the global impacts of changes in particulates.4 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

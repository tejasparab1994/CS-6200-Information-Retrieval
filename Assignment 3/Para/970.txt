atmospheric pressure  contents  mechanismedit atmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount of gas and its vertical distribution in the atmosphere.citation needed it is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in composition.citation needed standard atmosphereedit mean sea level pressureedit the mean sea level pressure mslp is the average atmospheric pressure at sea level this is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the internet when barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports they measure pressure adjusted to sea level not the actual local atmospheric pressure the altimeter setting in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment altitude variationedit where the constant parameters are as described below local variationedit atmospheric pressure varies widely on earth and these changes are important in studying weather and climate see pressure system for the effects of air pressure variations on weather recordsedit measurement based on depth of wateredit boiling point of wateredit measurement and mapsedit an important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices while in 1774 maskelyne was confirming newton's theory of gravitation at and on schiehallion in scotland using plumb bob deviation to show the effect of gravity and accurately measure elevation william roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations the agreement being to within one meter 3.28 feet this was then a useful tool for survey work and map making and long has continued to be useful it was part of the application of science which gave practical people the insight that applied science could easily and relatively cheaply be useful.12 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit experimentsedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

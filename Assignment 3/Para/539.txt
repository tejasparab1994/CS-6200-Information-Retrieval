romney hythe and dymchurch railway  contents  historyedit planningedit the railway was the dream of millionaire racing drivers captain john edwards presgrave jack howey and count louis zborowski the latter had constructed a railway at higham park his home at bridge kent and agreed to donate the rolling stock and infrastructure to the project however he was killed on 19 october 1924 in a motor racing accident at the monza grand prix before the romney marsh site was chosen and howey continued the project alone after howey had unsuccessfully attempted to buy the ravenglass  eskdale railway and extend it he investigated a greenfield site between burnham-on-sea and weston-super-mare in somerset and offered to buy the hundred of manhood  selsey tramway in sussex henry greenly drew howey's attention to the potential for a 15-inch gauge line between new romney and hythe howey first visited new romney on 8 september 1925 and decided there and then that it was an ideal location for his proposed railway.1 because it involved crossing public highways and acquiring land from a number of different owners a light railway order made under the light railways act 1896 was necessary and application for this was made in november 1925 a public inquiry was held by the light railway commissioners in the assembly rooms at new romney on 15 and 16 january 1926.2 the minister of transport indicated his intention to approve the application on 19 february 1926 and the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway order 1926 was made on 26 may.3 this incorporated the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway company as a statutory public utility undertaking gave it powers to construct and work the proposed railway and also included compulsory purchase powers over the land required which ultimately had to be used to acquire six plots of land on the proposed route.1 during construction the railway was visited on 5 august 1926 by the duke of york later king george vi who drove the northern chief hauling a train of approximately 100 passengers from jesson halt to new romney and back.4 openingedit the railway was opened on 16 july 1927 by lord warden of the cinque ports william lygon 7th earl beauchamp.5 the locomotives were designed by henry greenly who was commissioned by howey to work on the construction of the entire railway 6 and became the railway's first chief engineer until his abrupt resignation in march 1929.1 mountain class hercules hauled the inaugural train from hythe to new romney with guests including the mayors of the two towns and general sir ivor maxse second world waredit in 1940 the railway was taken over by the military during world war ii and a miniature armoured train was used on the line.9 it was also used by the department of petroleum warfare in the construction of pluto pipe line under the ocean intended to supply fuel to the allied forces after the d-day normandy landings during the latter stages of the construction of pluto considerable damage was caused to the track on the extension when to speed up the work lengths of pipe were dragged along the trackbed by bulldozers resulting in its reduction to a single track after the war.1 post waredit the line re-opened between hythe and new romney in 1946 the new romney to dungeness section following with a formal opening by laurel and hardy on 21 march 1947.10 regular services started on 29 march 1947 from 7 september 1977 until 24 july 2015 the railway provided school trains to transport children to and from the marsh academy in new romney the service was finally withdrawn due to falling usage.13 the railway's role as part of the local public transport network was extended when warren halt re-opened in 2009 providing a link to the romney marsh visitor centre further discussions with local councils took place regarding the possible expansion of burmarsh road and the provision of a new station at the gravel pits in west hythe in connection with both the proposed extensive new housing construction and the need to provide alternative transport to the a259 coast road.14 the railway which carries over 150000 passengers each year15 celebrated its 80th birthday in 2007 with a week of celebrations including reconstructions of scenes on the railway from the previous eight decades smallest public railway in the worldedit the railway has featured in several television and radio shows including an episode of the bbc series the inspector lynley mysteries in 200617 harry secombe's highway on 8 september 199118 michael bentine's it's a square world in 196419 bbc's multicoloured swapshop filmed on 20 february 1978 20 and children's show rainbow.citation needed the romney hythe  dymchurch railway associationedit formed in 1967 as a supporters association and regarded with some suspicion by the railway's management of the time the association has become a significant contributor to the railway's continuance and refurbishment it is now the largest single shareholder in the railway and its members provide a significant input of voluntary labour on both operating and maintenance work.not in citation given it became a registered charity on 23 january 2009.21 at 31 december 2015 its membership stood at 3355.22 stationsedit stations currently openedit stations in full or limited use stations closededit those shown as 'halt never had a higher status all stations below became halts prior to their closure stations proposededit stations which never existed but were at one time proposed by the directors or are currently under consideration way and worksedit permanent wayedit the original sleepers were creosoted baltic fir spaced at 22 inch centres.24 these have now been entirely replaced by second-hand standard gauge sleepers cut into thirds creosoted douglas fir or jarrah and karri australian hardwoods from the eucalyptus family the railway has a permanent way team with a full-time staff of platelayers it forms part of the larger engineering department some platelayers work all year round whilst others are diverted to other seasonal employment within the engineering department for example as summer drivers when more drivers are required than during the out of season periods additionally the permanent way team is strengthened on many days of the year especially in the winter months by volunteer workers way and works dataedit the ruling gradient and tightest curve are the results of post-1972 reconstruction work pre-1990 references to these give out of date figures statements in a number of books claiming the summit of the line is at star dyke a point approximately midway between burmarsh road level crossing and willop sewer are only partly correct whilst it is the highest point between hythe and new romney 30 it is not the highest on the entire line signallingedit signal boxesedit there were originally six signal boxes on the first section of the line to open hythe to new romney all were equipped with greenly designed fully interlocked lever frames constructed by jackson rigby ltd at new romney these were hythe  16 levers controlling points and signals within the station area now the only original jackson rigby lever frame in existence palmarsh  although this building is known to have existed there is doubt about whether the 8 lever jackson rigby frame it contained was ever fully connected up the frame was later transferred to greatstone see below the box itself had vanished by the late-1940s burmarsh road  2 levers located in the booking office and controlling signals the station building had vanished by the mid-1950s dymchurch  confusion surrounds the number of levers in this box with different sources quoting 1031 12 32 and 16.33 the box had vanished by 1963 and signalling is controlled here today by a push button electronic panel in the booking office and a 2 lever ground frame released by an annett's key normally held in the signal panel new romney  17 levers controlling points and signals within the station area the lever frame was enlarged to the present 24 levers when the line was extended to dungeness in 1928.24 the extension to dungeness led to the enlargement of the lever frame at new romney as mentioned above and also the opening of two new signal boxes greatstone  the 8 lever frame originally at palmarsh was transferred here and installed in the booking office.35 dungeness  like dymchurch it is uncertain how many levers this box actually contained arrangements for working the temporary turning wye at the pilot are not known locomotivesedit the rh&dr is still the only user of the 4-8-2 mountain type locomotive in the uk with no 6 samson and no 5 hercules in regular service the fleet includes two diesels no 12 j b snell delivered in february 1983 and renamed from its original john southland in may 2014 and no 14 delivered november 1989 and later named captain howey locomotives in serviceedit including engines serviceable under overhaul awaiting overhaul or reserved to shunting or engineering duties.37 a drivers vigilance device dvd has been installed on all main line locomotives except no 6 which will be fitted during overhaul.needs update no 1 green goddess passes hythe signal box with an evening departure for new romney no 7 typhoon at st mary's bay station locomotive namesedit locomotives withdrawn from serviceedit this list includes engines sold scrapped failed in trials or otherwise withdrawn all engines were internal combustion locomotives locomotives on siteedit in addition to the railway's 17 own locomotives one additional engine is currently housed at new romney this is a partially constructed third-scale reproduction of an lms princess coronation class locomotive commonly known as the 'duchess type although of the 38 engines of this class only 10 were named after duchesses the replica was commissioned by paul riley a director of the railway as a private project and is currently stored in an engineers depot.45 following the unexpected death of mr riley on 4 june 2008 the future of this locomotive is currently unknown it is understood that the machine is more than half complete.46 passenger trafficedit passenger servicesedit the railway was conceived and constructed as a public service not as a tourist attraction although it now relies on tourist trade school children were transported under contract to kent county council to the marsh academy known as southland's comprehensive school until 2007 this service was provided all year during term time the contract ceased due to falling passenger numbers after the summer term in july 2015 local residents are transported to shopping centres and the railway has operated 'shoppers specials' holiday camp trains have operated with camps at romney sands st mary's bay and dymchurch charters are operated as required during the second world war the railway was operated by the royal engineers and later the somerset light infantry as a military railway and there was extensive transport of soldiers on troop trains passenger vehiclesedit at the outset the railway was equipped with four-wheeled 8-seater coaches designed by henry greenly and his son kenneth 117 of these had been built by 1928.1 with only half height doors and no glazing except in the end bulkheads these were totally unsuitable for winter operation especially to dungeness in 1928 the railway took delivery of eight fully enclosed 12-seat bogie coaches built by the clayton carriage  wagon company of lincoln which incorporated electric lighting and steam heating in 1934 howey decided to scrap all the original four-wheelers and replace them with fully enclosed bogie vehicles the 16 foot underframes for these were constructed by robert hudson ltd of leeds and the bodies were built locally by the hythe cabinet  joinery works ltd by june 1936 54 of these together with two matching vans had been taken into stock.1 the rh&dr now operates 20-seat and 16-seat open and closed coaches these have been built on four different types of underframe the first batch of 20-seater closed coaches were bodied with utile an african hardwood  pronounced you-till-eye and numbered 51 to 61 inclusive from coach 62 onwards aluminium has been used over 80 years the coach livery has changed from all-over green to brown and cream blue blue and cream green and cream chocolate and cream and red and cream in the late 1980s from 2000 rakes of coaches trains of around a dozen coaches have been painted in individual liveries and there are now maroon green blue crimson and teak coaches 'heritage coaches are chocolate and cream the railway has built several coaches to accommodate wheelchair users starting with driving trailer coach 105 heavily re-built after extensive accident damage in 1993 and later named marjorie followed by 601 elsie then 602 winn and 603 may a new coach design featuring a lower floor for easier loading and a higher roof-line giving better headroom for wheelchair users was introduced in 2015 the first phylis is painted lined brown and normally runs with the teak coaches two further coaches iris for the green set and edith may for the teak/chocolate set are under construction and will carry batteries in a compartment over one end bogie for coach lighting as well as the wheelchair compartment which has tip-up seats each will have a guard's compartment with emergency brake valve vacuum gauge side ducket lookouts and a standard seating compartment the guard's compartment has four seats and may be used by passengers when not in use by the guard in addition to the main stock the 'heritage set is made up of freight trafficedit freight servicesedit from the outset the railway's owners and designers envisaged freight services two of the original locomotives no 5 hercules and no 6 samson were built to the 'mountain wheel arrangement 4-8-2 unique on any british railway and giving the ability to haul heavy freight with only a small loss of speed when used on passenger work in the early years the railway carried a limited amount of freight mainly shingle and fish traffic a goods shed was built at new romney and featured dual gauge track allowing easy transfer between the standard and 15 inch gauges this was seldom used and was demolished in about 1934 the greater part of the railway's freight traffic in the early years was carried for the war department who made extensive use of the line to convey materials and equipment for the construction of the reinforced concrete sound ranging detectors they were experimenting with near greatstone a special siding was laid in joining their working site with the rhdr main line the course of which can still be traced today 2016 and the wd constructed their own locomotive to work their trains from time to time the railway has had short term ad hoc freight contracts for example one in 1975 to transport drainage pipes the most recent freight workings involved delivering gas mains from new romney to greatstone in 1989 as a publicity stunt the first gas main train was steam hauled using no 4 the bug which appeared on the local tv news that evening the railway operates its own engineering and permanent way trains which now form the majority of its non-passenger workings dungeness fish tradeedit there are several disused sidings on the beach at dungeness these were used by fishermen to help move their hauls across the shingle this joint provision was to allow transport of fish from dungeness to hythe and there to transfer it to road the company had four-wheel fish wagons stencilled fish only the service was developed from 1937 following closure of the south eastern railway's dungeness line that year the fish trade developed in a small way and was withdrawn two such sidings are still in place but are both in a very poor state of repair although they were used by fishermen to transport fish across the beach for many years after the main railway service was withdrawn to facilitate the transfer of this traffic from rail to road on its arrival at hythe the track serving platform 1 there extended into the car park for some years.8 uncrushed shingle transportedit the most successful freight service was the uncrushed ballast service following withdrawal of war department operations over their siding near maddieson's camp the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains in 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed tipper wagons skips were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line and then up the main line to hythe often lying over in the sidings at dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks at hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp after the war the hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding in what is now new romney station car park the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders this practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of new romney on the dungeness line the fence line can still be seen in 1951 after 14 years the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline.1 at hythe the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding postal serviceedit the railway is licensed by the post office for rail postal services and is entitled to issue postage stamps a number of first day covers have been issued a four-wheel secure postage wagon was constructed parcels serviceedit the railway operates a casual parcels service parcels handed in at one station will be delivered to another for collection this is the last remnant of the railway's freight services freight vehiclesedit the railway has permanent way stock examples of which include armoured trainedit during world war ii a miniature armoured train was used on the line to patrol the coast in case of invasion the train was armed with a boys anti-tank rifle and lewis guns.948 proposed extension to sandlingedit supposition that the 4-8-2 locomotives hercules and samson were ordered for the project which involved steep inclines is unfounded as the engines were intended for freight traffic in particular a contract with kent county council to transport up to 30000 tons of ballast a year from their pits at palmarsh in the end this contract failed to materialize.50 tendersedit the following tenders are in use greenly tendersedit ashford tendersedit until 1959 when its tender was cut down in size hercules ran with the cab roof raised on blocks of wood to match the height of the tender.52 tender shortageedit hercules was out of service after the burmarsh road level crossing incident in 2003 and samson was withdrawn from service for an intermediate overhaul shortly afterwards once both locomotives were back in service the railway was faced with a tender shortage samson was kept from mainline service while hercules was coupled to the tender from green goddess while it was stored prior to overhaul during the 2007 season samson saw service using the tender from hurricane while it was being overhauled a situation that had also happened in 1949 when samson was used for ballast train duties safetyedit the railway has an exceptionally good safety recordcitation needed and all staff both employed and volunteer undergo extensive training incidentsedit there have been a number of serious accidents over the railway's 90 year operation with an extensive mainline timetable the majority of these have been related to level crossings and in every documented case the road user has either admitted liability or been found to have been in the wrong by the subsequent investigation despite the presence of large numbers of visitors and tourists almost all recorded level crossing incidents have involved local car drivers the more serious incidents including those at level crossings have been level crossingsedit ownership and operationedit ownershipedit it is usual for the two companies to share the same board of directors with the anomaly that whilst the romney hythe  dymchurch railway association has been granted a seat on the statutory company's board it has no direct representation on the plc's board directorsedit the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway order 1926 85 restricted the maximum number of directors of the statutory company to five and named captain john edwards presgrave howey gladys may howey captain john alexander holder major william bertram bell and henry greenly as the first directors greenly never owned more than 50 shares in the company so was ineligible to sit on the board and holder did not achieve the qualifying holding of 250 shares until 30 december 1929.1 gladys howey was also ineligible until 1931 when her shareholding reached 250 and she was able to join the board section 5 of the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway amendment order 1974 83 increased the maximum number of directors from five to 10 and also set the minimum number of directors at three operationedit the day-to-day operation of the railway is in the hands of a full-time permanent staff of around 35 assisted by 5 part-time permanent staff.86 these include a general manager departmental managers engineering commercial and operations and a large number of engineering staff from locomotive fitters to permanent way gangers and catering staff the new romney and dungeness cafes and the light railway restaurant adjoining hythe station are open all year round some of the railway's other commercial outlets are more seasonal in addition to this core staff seasonal employees are taken on through the summer season particularly to increase the staffing of the shops and catering outlets and to provide the required levels of staffing at stations at the height of the operating season there are over 60 staff on the payroll.1 the railway depends upon a dedicated team of fully trained but unpaid volunteer staff members who work on the railway in their own spare time volunteer staff work throughout the railway in engineering posts operating positions commercial outlets and

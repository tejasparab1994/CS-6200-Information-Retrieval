carnot heat engine every thermodynamic system exists in a particular state a thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state in the process of going through this cycle the system may perform work on its surroundings thereby acting as a heat engine a heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and in the process converting some of that energy to mechanical work the cycle may also be reversed the system may be worked upon by an external force and in the process it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine  contents  carnot's diagramedit in the adjacent diagram from carnot's 1824 work reflections on the motive power of fire3 there are two bodies a and b kept each at a constant temperature that of a being higher than that of b these two bodies to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric we will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.4 carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power i.e. work by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body a to body b it also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator modern diagramedit the previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by carnot in discussing his ideal engines the figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine such as the carnot engine in the diagram the working body system a term introduced by clausius in 1850 can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat q can be introduced or transmitted to produce work carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion such as vapor of water vapor of alcohol vapor of mercury a permanent gas or air etc although in these early years engines came in a number of configurations typically qh was supplied by a boiler wherein water was boiled over a furnace qc was typically supplied by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine the output work w here is the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm which was then typically used to turn a pulley so to lift water out of flooded salt mines carnot defined work as weight lifted through a height  carnot cycleedit the carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps carnot's theoremedit carnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact no engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs  a corollary to carnot's theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient since the working fluid comes back to the same state after one cycle and entropy of the system is a state function the change in entropy of the working fluid system is 0 thus it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum this derivation is carried out in the next section the coefficient of performance cop of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency efficiency of real heat enginesedit for a real heat engine the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible the working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0 but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0 the internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable so its total change in one cycle is 0 so the total work done by the systemwdisplaystyle w is equal to the heat put into the systemqhdisplaystyle q_texth minus the heat taken outqcdisplaystyle q_textc for real engines sections 1 and 3 of the carnot cycle in which heat is absorbed by the working fluid from the hot reservoir and released by it to the cold reservoir respectively no longer remain ideally reversible and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place where the temperature of the fluidtdisplaystyle t is always slightly lesser thanthdisplaystyle t_texth in this process so one would get where during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir the temperature of the fluidtdisplaystyle t is always slightly greater thantcdisplaystyle t_textc we have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is 0 we must have the previous three equations combine to give equations 2 and 7 combine to give hence hence the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal carnot engine equation 7 signifies that the total entropy of the total systemthe two reservoirs  fluid increases for the real engine because the entropy gain of the cold reservoir

temperaturethdisplaystyle t_texth the inequality in equation 7 is essentially the statement of the clausius theorem according to the second theorem the efficiency of the carnot engine is independent

virginia the area's history begins with several indigenous groups including the powhatan in 1607 the london company established the colony of virginia as the first permanent new world english colony slave labor and the land acquired from displaced native american tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy virginia was one of the 13 colonies in the american revolution and joined the confederacy in the american civil war during which richmond was made the confederate capital and virginia's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of west virginia although the commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following reconstruction both major national parties are competitive in modern virginia.9 the virginia general assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the new world.10 the state government was ranked most effective by the pew center on the states in both 2005 and 2008.11 it is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally manages local roads and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms virginia's economy has many sectors agriculture in the shenandoah valley federal agencies in northern virginia including the headquarters of the u.s department of defense and central intelligence agency cia and military facilities in hampton roads the site of the region's main seaport  contents  geography geology and terrain the chesapeake bay separates the contiguous portion of the commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of virginia's eastern shore the bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the susquehanna river and the james river.17 many of virginia's rivers flow into the chesapeake bay including the potomac rappahannock york and james which create three peninsulas in the bay.1819 coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 45 distinct coal beds near mesozoic basins.28 over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources such as slate kyanite sand or gravel were also mined in virginia in 2012.29 the state's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4000 caves ten of which are open for tourism.30 35 million years ago a bolide impacted what is now eastern virginia the resulting crater may explain sinking and earthquakes in the region.31 climate in recent years the expansion of the southern suburbs of washington d.c into northern virginia has introduced an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas.37 in the american lung association's 2011 report 11 counties received failing grades for air quality with fairfax county having the worst in the state due to automobile pollution.3839 haze in the mountains is caused in part by coal power plants.40 ecosystem forests cover 65 of the state primarily with deciduous broad leaf trees in the western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of virginia.41 lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance with hickory and oak in the blue ridge.32 however since the early 1990s gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests.42 in the lowland tidewater and piedmont yellow pines tend to dominate with bald cypress wetland forests in the great dismal and nottoway swamps other common trees and plants include red bay wax myrtle dwarf palmetto tulip poplar mountain laurel milkweed daisies and many species of ferns the largest areas of wilderness are along the atlantic coast and in the western mountains where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in north america are found.3243 the atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the south atlantic pine forests and lower southeast coastal plain maritime flora the latter found primarily in eastern and central virginia mammals include white-tailed deer black bear beaver bobcat coyote raccoon skunk groundhog virginia opossum gray fox red fox and eastern cottontail rabbit.44 other mammals include nutria fox squirrel gray squirrel flying squirrel chipmunk brown bat and weasel birds include cardinals the state bird barred owls carolina chickadees red-tailed hawks ospreys brown pelicans quail seagulls bald eagles and wild turkeys virginia is also home to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker the peregrine falcon was reintroduced into shenandoah national park in the mid-1990s.45 walleye brook trout roanoke bass and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish.46 running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders.32 the chesapeake bay is host to many species including blue crabs clams oysters and rockfish also known as striped bass.47 history jamestown 2007 marked virginia's quadricentennial year celebrating 400 years since the establishment of the jamestown colony the celebrations highlighted contributions from native americans africans and europeans each of which had a significant part in shaping virginia's history.5354 warfare including among these groups has also had an important role virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the french and indian war the american revolution and the civil war to the cold war and the war on terrorism.55 stories about historic figures such as those surrounding pocahontas and john smith george washington's childhood or the plantation elite in the slave society of the antebellum period have also created potent myths of state history and have served as rationales for virginia's ideology.56 colony several european expeditions including a group of spanish jesuits explored the chesapeake bay during the 16th century.60 in 1583 queen elizabeth i of england granted walter raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of spanish florida.61 in 1584 raleigh sent an expedition to the atlantic coast of north america.62 the name virginia may have been suggested then by raleigh or elizabeth perhaps noting her status as the virgin queen and may also be related to a native phrase wingandacoa or name wingina.63 initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from south carolina to maine plus the island of bermuda.64 later subsequent royal charters modified the colony's boundaries the london company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary charter of 1606 which granted land rights to this area the company financed the first permanent english settlement in the new world jamestown named for king james i it was founded in may 1607 by christopher newport.65 in 1619 colonists took greater control with an elected legislature called the house of burgesses with the bankruptcy of the london company in 1624 the settlement was taken into royal authority as an english crown colony.66 statehood the british parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the french and indian war were deeply unpopular in the colonies in the house of burgesses opposition to taxation without representation was led by patrick henry and richard henry lee among others.78 virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773 and sent delegates to the continental congress the following year.79 after the house of burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774 virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the virginia conventions on may 15 1776 the convention declared virginia's independence from the british empire and adopted george mason's virginia declaration of rights which was then included in a new constitution.80 another virginian thomas jefferson drew upon mason's work in drafting the national declaration of independence.81 when the american revolutionary war began george washington was selected to head the colonial army during the war the capital was moved to richmond at the urging of governor thomas jefferson who feared that williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to british attack.82 in 1781 the combined action of continental and french land and naval forces trapped the british army on the virginia peninsula where troops under george washington and comte de rochambeau defeated british general cornwallis in the siege of yorktown his surrender on october 19 1781 led to peace negotiations in paris and secured the independence of the colonies.83 virginians were instrumental in writing the united states constitution james madison drafted the virginia plan in 1787 and the bill of rights in 1789.81 virginia ratified the constitution on june 25 1788 the three-fifths compromise ensured that virginia with its large number of slaves initially had the largest bloc in the house of representatives together with the virginia dynasty of presidents this gave the commonwealth national importance in 1790 both virginia and maryland ceded territory to form the new district of columbia though the virginian area was retroceded in 1846.84 virginia is called mother of states because of its role in being carved into states like kentucky which became the 15th state in 1792 and for the numbers of american pioneers born in virginia.85 civil war and aftermath in addition to agriculture slave labor was increasingly used in mining shipbuilding and other industries.86 the execution of gabriel prosser in 1800 nat turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and john brown's raid on harpers ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the plantation economy by 1860 almost half a million people roughly 31 of the total population of virginia were enslaved.8788 this division contributed to the start of the american civil war virginia voted to secede from the united states on april 17 1861 after the battle of fort sumter and abraham lincoln's call for volunteers on april 24 virginia joined the confederate states of america which chose richmond as its capital.85 after the 1861 wheeling convention 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of west virginia which chose to remain loyal to the union virginian general robert e lee took command of the army of northern virginia in 1862 and led invasions into union territory ultimately becoming commander of all confederate forces during the war more battles were fought in virginia than anywhere else including bull run the seven days battles chancellorsville and the concluding battle of appomattox court house.89 after the capture of richmond in april 1865 the state capital was briefly moved to lynchburg90 while the confederate leadership fled to danville.91 virginia was formally restored to the united states in 1870 due to the work of the committee of nine.92 during the post-war reconstruction era virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools and guaranteed political civil and voting rights.93 the populist readjuster party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white democratic party gained power after 1883.94 it passed segregationist jim crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the constitution of virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most african americans and many poor european americans.95 though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation african americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in virginia society.96 post-reconstruction new economic forces also changed the commonwealth virginian james albert bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered on richmond in 1886 railroad magnate collis potter huntington founded newport news shipbuilding which was responsible for building six major world war i-era battleships for the u.s navy from 1907 to 1923.97 during the war german submarines like u-151 attacked ships outside the port.98 in 1926 dr w.a.r goodwin rector of williamsburg's bruton parish church began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of john d rockefeller jr.99 though their project like others in the state had to contend with the great depression and world war ii work continued as colonial williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.100 protests started by barbara rose johns in 1951 in farmville against segregated schools led to the lawsuit davis v county school board of prince edward county this case filed by richmond natives spottswood robinson and oliver hill was decided in 1954 with brown v board of education which rejected the segregationist doctrine of separate but equal but in 1958 under the policy of massive resistance led by the influential segregationist senator harry f byrd and his byrd organization the commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding.101 the civil rights movement gained many participants in the 1960s it achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 in 1964 the united states supreme court ordered prince edward county and others to integrate schools.102 in 1967 the court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with loving v virginia from 1969 to 1971 state legislators under governor mills godwin rewrote the constitution after goals such as the repeal of jim crow laws had been achieved in 1989 douglas wilder became the first african american elected as governor in the united states.103 the cold war led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in northern virginia near washington d.c. and correlative population growth.104 the central intelligence agency in langley was involved in various cold war events including as the target of soviet espionage activities also among the federal developments was the pentagon built during world war ii as the headquarters for the department of defense it was one of the targets of the september 11 attacks 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane was crashed into the building.105 cities and towns virginia is divided into 95 counties and 38 independent cities the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents.107 this general method of treating cities and counties on par with each other is unique to virginia only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the united states each in a different state.108 virginia limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand laws expressly allowed by the virginia general assembly under what is known as dillon's rule.109 in addition to independent cities there are also incorporated towns which operate under their own governments but are part of a county finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties

effectiveness and infrastructure tied with utah and washington this was the second consecutive time that virginia received the highest grade in the nation.11 since 1971 the government has functioned under the seventh constitution of virginia which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system similar to the federal structure the government is divided in three branches legislative executive and judicial the legislature is the general assembly a bicameral body whose 100-member house of delegates and 40-member senate write the laws for the commonwealth the assembly is stronger than the executive as it selects judges and justices the governor and lieutenant governor are elected every four years in separate elections incumbent governors cannot run for re-election however the lieutenant governor and attorney general can and governors may serve non-consecutive terms.285 the judicial system the oldest in america consists of a hierarchy from the supreme court of virginia and the court of appeals of virginia to the circuit courts the trial courts of general jurisdiction and the lower general district courts and juvenile and domestic relations district courts.286 politics over the 20th century virginia shifted from a largely rural politically southern and conservative state to a more urbanized pluralistic and politically moderate environment up until the 1970s virginia was a racially divided one-party state dominated by the byrd organization.293 the legacy of slavery in the state effectively disfranchised african americans until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.294 enfranchisement and immigration of other groups especially hispanics have placed growing importance on minority voting295 while voters that identify as white working-class declined by three percent between 2008 and 2012.296 regional differences play a large part in virginia politics.297 rural southern and western areas moved to support the republican party in response to its southern strategy while urban and growing suburban areas including much of northern virginia form the democratic party base.298299 democratic support also persists in union-influenced roanoke in southwest virginia college towns such as charlottesville and blacksburg and the southeastern black belt region.300 in federal elections since 2006 both parties have seen successes republican senator george allen lost close races in 2006 to democratic newcomer jim webb and again in 2012 to webb's replacement former governor tim kaine.310 in 2008 democrats won both united states senate seats former governor mark warner was elected to replace retiring republican john warner.311 the state went republican in 13 out of 14 presidential elections from 1952 to 2004 including 10 in a row from 1968 to 2004 however democrat barack obama carried virginia's 13 electoral votes in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.296 in the 2010 elections republicans won three united states house of representatives seats from the democrats of the state's eleven seats in the house of representatives republicans hold seven and democrats hold four virginia is considered a swing state in future presidential elections.9 in the 2016 presidential election democrat hillary clinton carried virginia marking the third consecutive win for the democratic party at the presidential level and the first time the state gave its electoral votes to a democrat who did not win the national electoral vote since 1924 in contrast the state gave donald j trump the smallest percentage of virginian votes for any republican party presidential nominee since thomas e dewey in 1948 sports virginia is the most populous u.s state without a major professional sports league

isentropic process in thermodynamics an isentropic process is an idealized thermodynamic process that is both adiabatic and reversible.123456 the work transfers of the system are frictionless and there is no transfer of heat or matter such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes.7 the word 'isentropic is occasionally though not customarily interpreted in another way reading it as if its meaning were deducible from its etymology this is contrary to its original and customarily used definition in this occasional reading it means a process in which the entropy of the system remains unchanged for example because work done on the system includes friction internal to the system and heat is withdrawn from the system in just the right amount to compensate for the internal friction so as to leave the entropy unchanged.8  contents  backgroundedit the second law of thermodynamics states that for reversible processes an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally insulating the system from its surroundings temperature is the thermodynamic conjugate variable to entropy thus the conjugate process would be an isothermal process in which the system is thermally connected to a constant-temperature heat bath isentropic processes in thermodynamic systemsedit isentropic efficiencies of steady-flow devices in thermodynamic systemsedit most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic process.the parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency.12 isentropic efficiency of turbines isentropic efficiency of compressors isentropic efficiency of nozzles for all the above equations isentropic devices in thermodynamic cyclesedit ideal rankine cycle 1->2 isentropic compression in a pumpideal rankine cycle 3->4 isentropic expansion in a turbineideal carnot cycle 2->3 isentropic expansionideal carnot cycle 4->1 isentropic compressionideal otto cycle 1->2 isentropic compressionideal otto cycle 3->4 isentropic expansionideal diesel cycle 1->2 isentropic compressionideal diesel cycle 3->4 isentropic expansionideal brayton cycle 1->2 isentropic compression in a compressorideal brayton cycle 3->4 isentropic expansion in a turbineideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle 1->2 isentropic compression in a compressornote the isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics real systems are not truly isentropic but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes isentropic flowedit in fluid dynamics an isentropic flow is a fluid flow that is both adiabatic and reversible that is no heat is added to the flow and no energy transformations occur due to friction or dissipative effects for an isentropic flow of a perfect gas several relations can be derived to define the pressure density and temperature along a streamline note that energy can be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation as long as it doesn't happen as heat exchange an example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow for an isentropic flow entropy density can vary between different streamlines if the entropy density is the same everywhere then the flow is said to be homentropic derivation of the isentropic relationsedit for a closed system the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added the reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is wherepdisplaystyle p is the pressure andvdisplaystyle v is the volume the change in enthalpy hupvdisplaystyle h=u+pv! is given by next a great deal can be computed for isentropic processes of an ideal gas for any transformation of an ideal gas it is always true that using the general results derived above fordudisplaystyle du anddhdisplaystyle dh then so for an ideal gas the heat capacity ratio can be written as using the equation of state for an ideal gaspvnrtdisplaystyle pv=nrt! also for constantcpcvrdisplaystyle c_p=c_v+r per mole thus for isentropic processes with an ideal gas table of isentropic relations for an ideal gasedit derived from below is the abbreviation of the above formulae see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

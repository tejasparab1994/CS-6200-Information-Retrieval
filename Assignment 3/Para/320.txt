evacuation for kayangel and although most residents ignored the warning they all survived the storm.16 as haiyan progressed westward the easternmost advisories were gradually discontinued.28 as haiyan intensified into a typhoon on november 5 warnings were raised across palau and yap state.2930 government offices in melekeok were used as an evacuation building for palau.31 despite mandatory evacuation orders most residents on kayangel remained on the island and rode out the typhoon.32 philippinesedit officials placed police officers in the bicol region ahead of the storm.38 in the

council ndrrmc as of april 17 2014.3 typhoon haiyan called typhoon yolanda in the philippines caused catastrophic damage throughout much of the islands of leyte where cities and towns were largely destroyed.53 as of april 17 2016 the national disaster risk reduction and management council ndrrmc confirmed 6300 fatalities across the country 5877 of those taking place in the eastern visayas.3 the true death toll remains unclear being claimed to be at least 10000 by some victims from tacloban city leyte as of november 13 2015 the philippine red cross estimated that 22000 people were missing haiyan's first landfall was at guiuan in eastern samar where the typhoon touched down at 4:40am.6061 nearly all structures in the township suffered at least partial damage many of which were completely flattened.62 for several days following haiyan's first landfall the damage situation in the fishing town remained unclear due to lack of communication in and out of the area.63 the damage could finally be assessed after philippine air force staff arrived in guiuan on november 10.64 prior to this a local priest was able to take his motorbike from guiuan to the towns of cabalogan and calbayog also in samar armed with photos of the devastation shot on his mobile phone.65 although wind speeds were extreme the major cause of damage and loss of life appears to have been storm surge the major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of samar and leyte with a particular focus on tacloban because of its location between samar and leyte and the large population in low-lying areas.59 philippine department of the interior and local government dilg secretary mar roxas said the scale of the relief operation that was now required was overwhelming with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris.69 sebastian rhodes stampa head of a un disaster assessment co-ordination team said there was destruction on a massive scale in tacloban there are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris the last time i saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami.58 there is little communication in the city and no mobile phone coverage up the east coast of the leyte there are numerous towns and villages that are completely cut off without any assistance large parts of leyte and samar are without power and may have no power for a month.66 the storm crossed the visayas region for almost a day causing widespread flooding in cebu and bohol struck by a magnitude 7.2 earthquake two weeks before cities were also severely devastated.70 during the morning of november 8 media stations across the country were able to broadcast live the destruction of haiyan however before afternoon all communications on the visayas region failed the presidential communications department of president benigno aquino iii had difficulty contacting dilg secretary mar roxas and defense secretary voltaire gazmin in tacloban city to plan relief.71 widespread power interruptions landslides and flash floods were also reported major roads were blocked by trees and impassable 453 domestic and international airline flights were canceled some airports were also closed on november 8 and 9 ferries were affected relief and rescue efforts were underway by november 9 but some places remained isolated and out of communication due to severe damage.72 china and taiwanedit vietnamedit aftermathedit due to extensive damage and high death toll pagasa announced that the name yolanda would be stricken off the typhoon naming lists.8485 pagasa chose the name yasmin to replace yolanda for the 2017 season during their 2014 annual session the escap/wmo typhoon committee announced that the name haiyan would also be retired from its naming lists on january 1 2015 and was therefore replaced by the name bailu.86 philippinesedit world health organization representative in the philippines dr julie hall noted that while many survivors requiring medical attention in the first week suffer from trauma and fractures the concern shifts toward chronic conditions as the weeks pass the who coordinated the massive international response to help the philippine government meet the acute need for healthcare services in the affected areas.89 extreme damage to infrastructure throughout the region posed logistical problems that greatly slowed relief efforts though aid was flown into local airports most of it remained there as roads remained closed.90 according to estimates on november 13 only 20 percent of the affected population in tacloban city was receiving aid with lack of access to clean water some residents dug up water pipes and boiled water from there in order to survive thousands of people sought to evacuate the city via c-130 cargo planes however the slow process fueled further aggravation reports of escaped prisoners raping women in the city prompted a further urgency to evacuate one resident was quoted as saying tacloban is a dead city.53 due to the lack of electricity planes could only operate during the daylight further slowing the evacuations at dawn on november 12 thousands of people broke through fences and rushed planes only to be forced back by police and military personnel a similar incident occurred later that day as a u.s cargo plane was landing.91 on november 14 a correspondent from the bbc reported tacloban to be a war zone although the situation soon stabilized when the presence of government law enforcement was increased safety concerns prompted several relief agencies to back out of the operation and some united nations staff were pulled out for safety reasons a message circulating among the agencies urged them to not go into tacloban for this reason.92 on the west coast of leyte island residents in ormoc were fearing that the focus on tacloban city would leave them without aid though not as hard hit roughly 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed and supplies were running low hospitals in the city were either shut down or working at partial capacity leaving many of the nearly 2000 injured in the city without medical assistance in nearby baybay lack of assistance fueled anger and incited looting for survival.93 in the coastal community guiuan which took the full brunt of the typhoon mayor christopher gonzalez is credited with saving countless lives after he incessantly urged residents to evacuate he referred to the storm as delubyo deluge which roughly translates to armageddon of the town's 45000 residents 87 died 931 were injured and 23 others were listed as missing u.s navy capt russell hays a medical officer estimated that a storm of haiyan's caliber could have killed as many as 4500 in guiuan alone had it not been for the mayor's efforts.94 on november 18 the government of the philippines launched an online portal called the foreign aid transparency hub faith that provides the public a transparency view of the funds and other aids received by the government from the international community.9596 to lead the management and rehabilitation efforts of the central provinces in the philippines affected

residents were allowed to return to their homes by the department of health on december 7 2013 after an air quality test found out that benzene levels in affected areas reached near-zero parts per million earlier residents were asked to evacuate affected areas as the benzene levels had reached unhealthy amounts.103 looting and violenceedit throughout tacloban city widespread looting took place in the days following haiyan's passage in some instances relief trucks were attacked and had food stolen in the city two of the city's malls and numerous grocery stores were subjected to looting a fuel depot in the city was guarded by armed police while 200 additional officers were dispatched to assist.104 security checkpoints had since been set up all over tacloban and a curfew was imposed on residents to prevent more attacks.105 philippine military forces also prevented members of the new people's army from ambushing a relief convoy bound for samar in matnog sorsogon killing two.106 president benigno aquino iii considered declaring martial law in hopes of restoring order in affected areas.107108 criticism of government responseedit condemnations of slow government action in the relief effort in response to the typhoon mounted days after the storm had passed media reports criticized the aquino administration for apparent lack of preparation and coordination among government agencies in the aid operation.109110 up until november 12 five days after the typhoon struck survivors continued to struggle with basic necessities such as food water and shelter while remote towns in leyte and samar were yet to be reached by aid.111 the philippine government responded by saying that they have dealt with the tragedy quite well but the response had been slow due to the breakdown of the local governance in affected areas where officials and employees who were usually the first to respond in these events were victims of the typhoon themselves.112 cabinet secretary jose rene almendras said that the national government had to take over despite logistical challenges and assured it is working toward providing aid the quickest way possible to the survivors.113 the national government was also criticized for putting the responsibility of handling the dead to the bureau of fire instead to the department of health dr racquel fortun one of the forensic experts to go to the area three days after the typhoon insisted that handling of the bodies is a health matter and therefore a responsibility of doh.114 one of the biggest controversies of typhoon haiyan is probably the number of the victims or the body count according to the philippine government sources the number of those killed during the typhoon ranges from 4000 to 6000 individuals while some sources claim that the body count reaches up to 15000.115116117 humanitarian crisis and population displacementedit the philippines faced a humanitarian crisis days after the typhoon hit much of the visayas with 1.9 million homeless and more than 6000000 displaced.118 in tacloban alone ninety percent of the structures are either destroyed or damaged while other cities such as ormoc are reporting similar damage.119 the united nations fear that the possibility of the spread of disease is high due to the lack of food water shelter and medication casualties have been reported as a result of the lack of aid in affected areas and the number of dead is likely to rise.120 as a result of the damage in tacloban and much of leyte thousands of people who once lived in the area left and made their way into less affected areas such as cebu and manila.121 catbalogan reported that their population more than doubled after the typhoon with the influx of refugees into the city.122 around 20000 people have fled to manila as a result of the storm.123 international responseedit 190191192 193 aircraft from the republic of china air force and republic of china navy vessel deployed with supplies the united nations said it was going to increase critical relief operations as a result of the devastation caused by the typhoon its manila office issued a statement that read access remains a key challenge as some areas are still cut off from relief operations unknown numbers of survivors do not have basic necessities such as food water and medicines and remain inaccessible for relief operations as roads airports and bridges were destroyed or covered in wreckage.214 the united nations also began relief operations by this time however the severe damage to infrastructure hampered efforts to distribute supplies.104 the un activated the cluster system in which groups of humanitarian organizations un and non-un work to restore health shelter nutrition and economic activity.215 the world health

philippines.259 apart from having the two largest economies in the world both countries are involved in a complex relationship with the island country china is currently disputing the spratly islands in the south china sea with the philippines while the united states used to be an occupying power and currently has a mutual defense treaty with the islands.260 china was initially criticized for its meager contribution of us $100000 cash each from the government and the chinese red cross to the typhoon victims which led to commentary about its disputes with the philippines.261 earlier in 2013 the philippines sued china over the nine-dotted line commentators attribute this low amount to china's intentions to isolate the philippines while strengthening its ties with the rest of southeast asia.262 the move had mixed reactions from the public of china with some commending its decision while others such as the global times insisted that china should be a responsible power china later increased its contributions by us$1.64 million in supplies 138263 and sent its naval hospital ship peace ark for disaster relief.139 the contributions of the united states was in contrast to that of

umbrella group of environmental non-governmental organisations also joined the hunger strike.270 the correlation between the increasing intensity of storms and the progression of climate change was discussed by climate scientists typhoons hurricanes and all tropical storms draw their vast energy from the warmth of the sea we know sea-surface temperatures are warming pretty much around the planet so that's a pretty direct influence of climate change on the nature of the storm said will steffen director of the australian national university climate change institute.271 myles allen head of the climate dynamics group at the university of oxford said that the current consensus is that climate change is not making the risk of hurricanes any greater but there are physical arguments and evidence that there is a risk of more intense hurricanes.271 the huffington post made the point that the 70 deforestation of the philippines since 1900 as reported by the national forest management bureau made far more lethal flooding from cyclones like haiyan more likely.272 the ipcc fifth assessment report had stated in september of the same year that time series of cyclone indices such as power dissipation an aggregate compound of tropical cyclone frequency duration and intensity that measures total wind energy by tropical cyclones show upward trends in the north atlantic and weaker upward trends in the western north pacific since the late 1970s.271 in popular mediaedit a detailed analysis of typhoon haiyan and its destruction in the philippines was featured in a documentary called

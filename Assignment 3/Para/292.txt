greek language during antiquity greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the mediterranean world and many places beyond it would eventually become the official parlance of the byzantine empire and develop into medieval greek.5 in its modern form the greek language is the official language in two countries greece and cyprus a recognised minority language in seven other countries and is one of the 24 official languages of the european union the language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in greece cyprus italy albania turkey and the greek diaspora greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages greek and latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary  contents  historyedit greek has been spoken in the balkan peninsula since around the 3rd millennium bc6 or possibly earlier.7 the earliest written evidence is a linear b clay tablet found in messenia that dates to between 1450 and 1350 bc8 making greek the world's oldest recorded living language among the indo-european languages its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now extinct anatolian languages periodsedit the greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods diglossiaedit in the modern era the greek language entered a state of diglossia the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language what came to be known as the greek language question was a polarization between two competing varieties of modern greek dimotiki the vernacular form of modern greek proper and katharevousa meaning 'purified' a compromise between dimotiki and ancient greek which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed greek state in 1976 dimotiki was declared the official language of greece having incorporated features of katharevousa and giving birth to standard modern greek which is used today for all official purposes and in education.12 historical unityedit the historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the greek language is often emphasised although greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages never since classical antiquity has its cultural literary and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language.13 it is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages according to one estimation homeric greek is probably closer to demotic than 12-century middle english is to modern spoken english.14 geographic distributionedit greek is spoken by about 13 million people mainly in greece albania and cyprus but also worldwide by the large greek diaspora there are traditional greek-speaking settlements and regions in the neighbouring countries of albania bulgaria and turkey as well as in several countries in the black sea area such as ukraine russia romania georgia armenia and azerbaijan and around the mediterranean sea southern italy syria israel egypt lebanon libya and ancient coastal towns along the levant the language is also spoken by greek emigrant communities in many countries in western europe especially the united kingdom and germany canada the united states australia argentina brazil chile south africa and others official statusedit greek is the official language of greece where it is spoken by almost the entire population.15 it is also the official language of cyprus nominally alongside turkish.16 because of the membership of greece and cyprus in the european union greek is one of the organization's 24 official languages.17 furthermore greek is officially recognised as a minority language in parts of italy and official in dropull and himara albania and as a minority language all over albania18 as well as in lebanon syria armenia romania and ukraine as a regional or minority language in the framework of the european charter for regional or minority languages.19 greeks are also a recognised ethnic minority in hungary characteristicsedit the phonology morphology syntax and vocabulary of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period the division into conventional periods is as with all such periodisations relatively arbitrary especially because at all periods ancient greek has enjoyed high prestige and the literate borrowed heavily from it phonologyedit across its history the syllabic structure of greek has varied little greek shows a mixed syllable structure permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas it has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts the main phonological changes occurred during the hellenistic and roman period see koine greek phonology for details morphologyedit in all its stages the morphology of greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes a limited but productive system of compounding20 and a rich inflectional system although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time morphological changes are present throughout particularly in the nominal and verbal systems the major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case its functions being largely taken over by the genitive the verbal system has lost the infinitive the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood many have been replaced by periphrastic analytical forms nouns and adjectivesedit pronouns show distinctions in person 1st 2nd and 3rd number singular dual and plural in the ancient language singular and plural alone in later stages and gender masculine feminine and neuter and decline for case from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language.21 nouns articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun verbsedit the inflectional categories of the greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression greek verbs have synthetic inflectional forms for syntaxedit many aspects of the syntax of greek have remained constant verbs agree with their subject only the use of the surviving cases is largely intact nominative for subjects and predicates accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions genitive for possessors articles precede nouns adpositions are largely prepositional relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial however the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the modern form of the language ancient greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions and uses participles more restrictively the loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well ancient greek tended to be verb-final but neutral word order in the modern language is vso or svo vocabularyedit greek is a language distinguished by an extensive vocabulary most of the vocabulary of ancient greek was inherited but it includes a number of borrowings from the languages of the populations that inhabited greece before the arrival of proto-greeks.23 words of non-indo-european origin can be traced into greek from as early as mycenaean times they include a large number of greek toponyms the vast majority of modern greek vocabulary is directly inherited from ancient greek but in some cases words have changed meanings loanwords words of foreign origin have entered the language mainly from latin venetian and turkish during the older periods of greek loanwords into greek acquired greek inflections thus leaving only a foreign root word modern borrowings from the 20th century on especially from french and english are typically not inflected greek loanwords in other languagesedit classificationedit greek is an independent branch of the indo-european language family the ancient language most closely related to it may be ancient macedonian25 which many scholars suggest may have been a dialect of greek itself but it is so poorly attested that it is difficult to conclude anything about it.26 independently of the macedonian question some scholars have grouped greek into graeco-phrygian as greek and the extinct phrygian share features that are not found in other indo-european languages.27 among living languages some indo-europeanists suggest that greek may be most closely related to armenian see graeco-armenian or the indo-iranian languages see graeco-aryan but little definitive evidence has been found for grouping the living branches of the family.28 in addition albanian has also been considered somewhat related to greek and armenian by some linguists if proven and recognised the three languages would form a new balkan sub-branch with other dead european languages.29 writing systemedit linear bedit linear b attested as early as the late 15th century bc was the first script used to write greek.30 it is basically a syllabary which was finally deciphered by michael ventris and john chadwick in the 1950s its precursor linear a has not been deciphered to this day.30 the language of the linear b texts mycenaean greek is the earliest known form of greek.30 cypriot syllabaryedit another similar system used to write the greek language was the cypriot syllabary also a descendant of linear a via the intermediate cypro-minoan syllabary which is closely related to linear b but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences the cypriot syllabary is attested in cyprus from the 11th century bc until its gradual abandonment in the late classical period in favor of the standard greek alphabet.31 greek alphabetedit greek has been written in the greek alphabet since approximately the 9th century bc it was created by modifying the phoenician alphabet with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the vowels the variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late ionic variant introduced for writing classical attic in 403 bc in classical greek as in classical latin only upper-case letters existed the lower-case greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster more convenient cursive writing style with the use of ink and quill diacriticsedit in addition to the letters the greek alphabet features a number of diacritical signs three different accent marks acute grave and circumflex originally denoting different shapes of pitch accent on the stressed vowel the so-called breathing marks rough and smooth breathing originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/ and the diaeresis used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong these marks were introduced during the course of the hellenistic period actual usage of the grave in handwriting saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century and it has only been retained in typography after the writing reform of 1982 most diacritics are no longer used since then greek has been written mostly in the simplified monotonic orthography or monotonic system which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis the traditional system now called the polytonic orthography or polytonic system is still used internationally for the writing of ancient greek punctuationedit ancient greek texts often used scriptio continua 'continuous writing' which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries.33 latin alphabetedit see alsoedit referencesedit

spacex dragon dragon is a reusable spacecraft developed by spacex an american private space transportation company based in hawthorne california dragon is launched into space by the spacex falcon 9 two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle and spacex is developing a crewed version called the dragon v2 formerly dragonrider the dragon spacecraft was originally designed for human travel but so far has only been used to deliver cargo to the international space station iss while carrying out resupply missions to the iss space x has continued to work on the production of a human rated model this model will be able to be controlled by the command center in hawthorne ca as well as by the crew of the spacecraft during its maiden flight in december 2010 dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit.2 on 25 may 2012 a cargo variant of dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the international space station iss.101112 spacex is contracted to deliver cargo to the iss under nasa's commercial resupply services program and dragon began regular cargo flights in october 2012.13141516 with the dragon spacecraft and the orbital atk cygnus nasa seeks to increase its partnerships with domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry.17 on 3 june 2017 the crs-11 capsule largely assembled from previously flown components from the crs-4 mission in september 2014 was launched again for the first time with the hull structural elements thrusters harnesses propellant tanks plumbing and many of the avionics reused while the heat shield batteries and components exposed to sea water upon splashdown for recovery were replaced.18  contents  nameedit spacex's ceo elon musk named the spacecraft after the 1963 song puff the magic dragon by peter paul and mary reportedly as a response to critics who considered his spaceflight projects impossible.19 historyedit spacex began developing the dragon spacecraft in late 2004 making a public announcement in 2006 with a plan of entering service in 2009.20 also in 2006 spacex won a contract to use the dragon spacecraft for commercially supplied resupply services to the international space station for the american federal space agency nasa.21 nasa iss resupply contractedit commercial orbital transportation servicesedit in 2005 nasa solicited proposals for a commercial iss resupply cargo vehicle to replace the then-soon-to-be-retired space shuttle through its commercial orbital transportation services cots development program the dragon spacecraft was a part of spacex's proposal submitted to nasa in march 2006 spacex's cots proposal was issued as part of a team which also included md robotics the canadian company that had built the iss's canadarm2 on 18 august 2006 nasa announced that spacex had been chosen along with kistler aerospace to develop cargo launch services for the iss.21 the initial plan called for three demonstration flights of spacex's dragon spacecraft to be conducted between 2008 and 2010.2223 spacex and kistler were to receive up to $278 million and $207 million respectively23 if they met all nasa milestones but kistler failed to meet its obligations and its contract was terminated in 2007.24 nasa later re-awarded kistler's contract to orbital sciences.2425 commercial resupply services phase 1edit on 23 february 2009 spacex announced that its chosen phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator heat shield material pica-x had passed heat stress tests in preparation for dragon's maiden launch.2728 the primary proximity-operations sensor for the dragon spacecraft the dragoneye was tested in early 2009 during the sts-127 mission when it was mounted near the docking port of the space shuttle endeavour and used while the shuttle approached the international space station the dragoneye's lidar and thermography thermal imaging abilities were both tested successfully.2930 the cots uhf communication unit cucu and crew command panel ccp were delivered to the iss during the late 2009 sts-129 mission.31 the cucu allows the iss to communicate with dragon and the ccp allows iss crew members to issue basic commands to dragon.31 in summer 2009 spacex hired former nasa astronaut ken bowersox as vice president of their new astronaut safety and mission assurance department in preparation for crews using the spacecraft.32 as a condition of the nasa crs contract spacex analyzed the orbital radiation environment on all dragon systems and how the spacecraft would respond to spurious radiation events that analysis and the dragon design  which uses an overall fault-tolerant triple-redundant computer architecture rather than individual radiation hardening of each computer processor  was reviewed by independent experts before being approved by nasa for the cargo flights.33 during march 2015 it was announced that spacex had been awarded an additional three missions under commercial resupply services phase 1.34 these additional missions are spacex crs-13 spacex crs-14 and spacex crs-15 and would cover the cargo needs of 2017 on 24 february 2016 spacenews disclosed that spacex had been awarded a further five missions under commercial resupply services phase 1.35 this additional tranche of missions had spacex crs-16 and spacex crs-17 manifested for fy2017 while spacex crs-18 spacex crs-19 and spacex crs-20 and were notionally manifested for fy2018 commercial resupply services phase 2edit the commercial resupply services 2 crs2 contract definition/solicitation period commenced in 2014 and a result announced on 14 january 2016 the crs2 launches are expected to commence in 2019 and extend to at least 2024 on 14 january 2016 nasa announced that three companies had been awarded contracts for a minimum of six launches each spacex orbital atk and sierra nevada corporation won contracts.36 37 the maximum potential value of all the contracts was indicated to be $14bn but the minimum requirements would be considerably less no further financial information was disclosed the missions involved would be from late 2019 through to 2024 demonstration flightsedit the first flight of the falcon 9 a private flight occurred in june 2010 and launched a stripped-down version of the dragon capsule this dragon spacecraft qualification unit had initially been used as a ground test bed to validate several of the capsule's systems during the flight the unit's primary mission was to relay aerodynamic data captured during the ascent.3839 it was not designed to survive re-entry and did not nasa contracted for three test flights from spacex but later reduced that number to two the first dragon spacecraft launched on its first mission  contracted to nasa as cots demo flight 1  on 8 december 2010 and was successfully recovered following re-entry to earth's atmosphere the mission also marked the second flight of the falcon 9 launch vehicle.40 the dragoneye sensor flew again on sts-133 in february 2011 for further on-orbit testing.41 in november 2010 the federal aviation administration faa had issued a re-entry license for the dragon capsule the first such license ever awarded to a commercial vehicle.42 the second dragon flight also contracted to nasa as a demonstration mission launched successfully on 22 may 2012 after nasa had approved spacex's proposal to combine the cots 2 and 3 mission objectives into a single falcon 9/dragon flight renamed cots 2+.343 dragon conducted orbital tests of its navigation systems and abort procedures before being grappled by the iss canadarm2 and successfully berthing with the station on 25 may to offload its cargo.1044454647 dragon returned to earth on 31 may 2012 landing as scheduled in the pacific ocean and was again successfully recovered.4849 on 23 august 2012 nasa administrator charles bolden announced that spacex had completed all required milestones under the cots contract and was cleared to begin operational resupply missions to the iss.50 operational flightsedit from october 2012 to august 2017 dragon successfully completed 11 of 12 attempted resupply missions to the international space station dragon was launched on its first operational crs-contract mission on 8 october 201213 and completed the mission successfully on 28 october.51 spacex crs-2 the second crs mission from spacex was successfully launched on 1 march 2013 spacex crs-3 spacex's third crs mission was launched on 18 april 2014 and was berthed with the iss from 20 april 2014 through 18 may 2014.52 spacex crs-4 successfully launched on sunday 21 september 2014 and berthed with the iss on tuesday 23 september it splashed down in the pacific ocean carrying 3276 pounds of cargo and science samples.53 spacex crs-5 spacex's fifth crs mission was scheduled for launch on december 9 2014 but was delayed over several dates in december the launch was rescheduled to saturday january 10 2015 which completed successfully at 4:47 am central time.54 spacex crs-6 spacex's sixth crs mission was successfully launched on april 14 2015 at 20:10:41 utc from cape canaveral air force station in florida spacex crs-7 spacex's seventh crs mission was attempted on june 28 2015 from cape canaveral air force station in florida the mission was unsuccessful with an anomaly occurring during the ascent of the first stage resulting in an explosion and a total loss of the vehicle spacex crs-8 spacex's eighth crs mission was successfully launched on april 8 2016 from cape canaveral air force station in florida the first stage landed successfully on spacex's drone ship in the atlantic ocean and was subsequently reused to launch ses-10 on march 30 2017 spacex crs-9 spacex's ninth crs mission was successfully launched on july 18 2016 from cape canaveral air force station in florida the first stage landed successfully at landing zone 1 spacex crs-10 spacex's tenth crs mission was aborted on february 18 2017 due to an anomaly in the thrust vector control tvc of the second stage but successfully launched on the february 19th from kennedy space center in florida the first stage landed successfully on landing zone 1 spacex crs-11 spacex's eleventh crs mission was successfully launched on june 3 2017 from kennedy space center lc-39a being the 100th mission to be launched from that pad this mission was the first to re-fly a recovered dragon capsule that previously flew on crs-4 mission this mission delivered 2708 kilograms55 of cargo to the international space station including nicer.56 the first stage of the falcon 9 launch vehicle landed successfully at landing zone 1 spacex crs-12 spacex's twelfth crs mission was successfully launched on the first 'block 4 version of the falcon 9 on august 14 2017 from kennedy space center lc-39a at the first attempt this mission delivered 2349 kg 5179 lb of pressurized mass and 961 kg 2119 lb unpressurized the external payload manifested for this flight was the cream cosmic-ray detector last flight of a newly-built dragon capsule further missions will use refurbished spacecraft.57 crewed development programedit in 2006 elon musk stated that spacex had built a prototype flight crew capsule including a thoroughly tested 30-man-day life-support system.20 a video simulation of this escape system's operation was released in january 2011.58 musk stated in 2010 that the developmental cost of a crewed dragon and falcon 9 would be between $800 million and $1 billion.59 in 2009 and 2010 musk suggested on several occasions that plans for a crewed variant of the dragon were proceeding and had a two-to-three-year timeline to completion.6061 spacex submitted a bid for the third phase of ccdev ccicap.6263 nasa commercial crew development programedit spacex was not awarded funding during the first phase of nasa's commercial crew development ccdev milestone-based program however the company was selected on 18 april 2011 during the second phase of the program to receive an award valued at $75 million to help develop its crew system.6465 their ccdev2 milestones involved the further advancement of the falcon 9/dragon crew transportation design the advancement of the launch abort system propulsion design completion of two crew accommodations demos full-duration test firings of the launch abort engines and demonstrations of their throttle capability.66 spacex's launch abort system received preliminary design approval from nasa in october 2011.67 in december 2011 spacex performed its first crew accommodations test the second such test is expected to involve spacesuit simulators and a higher-fidelity crewed dragon mock-up.6869 in january 2012 spacex successfully conducted full-duration tests of its superdraco landing/escape rocket engine at its rocket development facility in mcgregor texas.70 in a planned in-flight abort test dragon will use its launch abort engines to escape from a modified falcon 9 that is already in flight.7980 the launch is planned to occur from slc-4e.77 this test will occur at the point of worst-case dynamic loads which is also when dragon has the smallest performance margin for separation from its launch vehicle.79 the falcon 9 planned to be used will only have three engines on the first stage and will have no second stage.77 an uncrewed test mission to the iss spx-dm1 is planned to be launched in november 2017.8182 it will be a 30-day mission that will spend the majority of its time docked to the space station.82 it will then land in the ocean and be retrieved.82 a crewed test mission to the iss spx-dm2 is planned to be launched in may 2018 and last for 14 days.83 development fundingedit in 2014 spacex released the total combined development costs for both the falcon 9 launch vehicle and the dragon capsule nasa provided us$396 million while spacex provided over us$450 million to fund both development efforts.84 productionedit in december 2010 the spacex production line was reported to be manufacturing one new dragon spacecraft and falcon 9 rocket every three months elon musk stated in a 2010 interview that he planned to increase production turnover to one dragon every six weeks by 2012.85 composite materials are extensively used in the spacecraft's manufacture to reduce weight and improve structural strength.86 variants and derivativesedit dragon crsedit the dragon spacecraft consists of a nose-cone cap that jettisons after launch a conventional blunt-cone ballistic capsule and an unpressurized cargo-carrier trunk equipped with two solar arrays.88 the capsule uses a pica-x heat shield based on a proprietary variant of nasa's phenolic impregnated carbon ablator pica material designed to protect the capsule during earth atmospheric entry even at high return velocities from lunar and martian missions.899091 the dragon capsule is re-usable and can fly multiple missions.88 the trunk is not recoverable it separates from the capsule before re-entry and burns up in earth's atmosphere.92 the trunk section which carries the spacecraft's solar panels and allows the transport of unpressurized cargo to the iss was first used for cargo on the spacex crs-2 mission the spacecraft is launched atop a falcon 9 booster.93 the dragon capsule is equipped with 18 draco thrusters.90 during its initial cargo and crew flights the dragon capsule will land in the pacific ocean and be returned to the shore by ship.94 for the iss dragon cargo flights the iss's canadarm2 grapples its flight-releasable grapple fixture and berths dragon to the station's us orbital segment using a common berthing mechanism.95 the crs dragon does not have an independent means of maintaining a breathable atmosphere for astronauts and instead circulates in fresh air from the iss.96 for typical missions dragon is planned to remain berthed to the iss for about 30 days.97 the crs dragon design was modified beginning with the fifth dragon flight on the spacex crs-3 mission to the iss in march 2014 while the outer mold line of the dragon was unchanged the avionics and cargo racks were redesigned to supply substantially more electrical power to powered cargo devices including the glacier and merlin freezer modules for transporting critical science payloads.100 dragonlabedit dragon 2edit a successor of dragon called dragon 2 is under development by spacex designed to support crewed missions it will be able to carry up to seven astronauts or some mix of crew and cargo to and from low earth orbit the dragon 2 heat shield is designed to withstand earth re-entry velocities from lunar and martian spaceflights.89 spacex has received several u.s government contracts to develop the dragon 2 crewed variant including a commercial crew development 2 ccdev 2-funded space act agreement in april 2011 and a commercial crew integrated capability ccicap-funded space act agreement in august 2012  red dragonedit in addition to spacex's privately funded plans for an eventual mars mission nasa ames research center had developed a concept called red dragon a low-cost mars mission that would use falcon heavy as the launch vehicle and trans-martian injection vehicle and the dragon 2-based capsule to enter the atmosphere of mars the concept was originally envisioned for launch in 2018 as a nasa discovery mission then alternatively for 2022 but as of september 2015update it has not been yet formally submitted for funding within nasa.103 the objectives of the mission would be return the samples from mars to earth at a fraction of the cost of the nasa own return-sample mission now projected at 6 billion dollars.103 on 27 april 2016 spacex announced its plan to go ahead and launch a modified dragon lander to mars in 2018.104105 on july 19th 2017 however elon musk announced that spacex had abandoned plans to continue the red dragon program.108 list of dragon missionsedit list includes only completed or currently manifested missions launch dates are listed in utc specificationsedit dragonlabedit the following specifications are published by spacex for the non-nasa non-iss commercial flights of the refurbished dragon capsules listed as dragonlab flights on the spacex manifest the specifications for the nasa-contracted dragon cargo were not included in the 2009 dragonlab datasheet.5 radiation toleranceedit dragon uses a radiation-tolerant design in the electronic hardware and software that make up its flight computers the system uses three pairs of computers each constantly checking on the others to instantiate a fault-tolerant design in the event of a radiation upset or soft error one of the computer pairs will perform a soft reboot.33 including the six computers that make up the main flight computers dragon employs a total of 18 triple-processor computers.33 see alsoedit cargo crew transport referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal

and the muslim-majority population the permanent settlement made millions of muslim peasants tenants of hindu estates and resentment of the hindu landed gentry grew.42 supported by the muslim aristocracy the british government created the province of eastern bengal and assam in 1905 the new province received increased investment in education transport and industry however the first partition of bengal created an uproar in calcutta and the indian national congress in response to growing hindu nationalism the all india muslim league was formed in dhaka during the 1906 all india

opposition alliance which included the awami league.53 the indo-pakistani war of 1965 blocked cross-border transport links with neighboring india in what is described as a second partition.54 in 1966

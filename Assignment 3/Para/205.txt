philippines filipino masculine or neutralfilipina femininepinoy colloquial masculinepinay colloquial feminine it is a founding member of the united nations world trade organization association of southeast asian nations the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum and the east asia summit it also hosts the headquarters of the asian development bank.27 the philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country28 which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing.29 it is one of the only two predominantly christian nations in southeast asia the other being east timor  contents  etymology history prehistory the metatarsal of the callao man reliably dated by uranium-series dating to 67000 years ago is the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date.36 this distinction previously belonged to the tabon man of palawan carbon-dated to around 26500 years ago.3738 negritos were also among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants but their first settlement in the philippines has not been reliably dated.39 precolonial epoch the discovery of iron at around the 1st century ad created significant social and economic changes which allowed settlements to grow larger and develop new social patterns characterized by social stratification and specialization.49 some of these polities particularly the coastal settlements at or near the mouths of large rivers50 eventually developed substantial trade contacts with the early trading powers of southeast asia most importantly the indianized kingdoms of malaysia and java the various dynasties of china50 thailand51 and later the muslim sultanate of brunei.52 they also traded with vietnam51 japan53 and other austronesian islands.54 based on archeological findings trade with china is believed to have begun in the tang dynasty but grew more extensive during the song dynasty.52 by the 2nd millennium ce some but not all philippine polities were known to have sent trade delegations which participated in the tributary system enforced by the chinese imperial court.52 these tributary states nominally acknowledged the sinocentric system which saw china and the imperial court as the cultural center of the world among the early philippine polities this arrangement fulfilled the requirements for trade with china but did not actually translate into political or military control.5250 regarding the relations of early philippine polities with the various state-level polities of indonesia and malaysia legendary accounts often mention the interaction of early philippine polities with the srivijaya empire but there is not much archeological evidence to definitively support such a relationship.49 considerable evidence exists on the other hand for extensive trade with the majapahit empire.55 the exact scope and mechanisms of indian cultural influences on early philippine polities are still the subject of some debate among southeast asian historiographers4956 but the current scholarly consensus is that there was probably little or no direct trade between india and the philippines4956 and indian cultural traits such as linguistic terms and religious practices55 filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries through early philippine polities relations with the hindu majapahit empire.49 the philippine archipelago is thus one of the countries others include afghanistan and southern vietnam just at the outer edge of what is considered the greater indian cultural zone.56 the early polities of the philippine archipelago were typically characterized by a three-tier social structure.4950 although different cultures had different terms to describe them this three-tier structure invariably consisted of an apex nobility class a class of freemen and a class of dependent debtor-bondsmen called alipin or oripun.4950 among the members of the nobility class were leaders who held the political office of datu which was responsible for leading autonomous social groups called barangay or dulohan.49 whenever these barangays banded together either to form a larger settlement49 or a geographically looser alliance group50 the more senior or respected among them would be recognized as a paramount datu variedly called a lakan sultan rajah or simply a more senior datu.524957 early historic coastal polities the 1300s saw the arrival and eventual spread of islam in the philippine archipelago in 1380 karim ul makdum and shari'ful hashem syed abu bakr an arab trader born in johore arrived in sulu from malacca and established the sultanate of sulu by converting sulu's rajah rajah baguinda ali and marrying his daughter.7778 at the end of the 15th century shariff mohammed kabungsuwan of johor introduced islam in the island of mindanao and established the sultanate of maguindanao the sultanate form of government extended further into lanao.79 islam then started to spread out of mindanao in the south and went into luzon in the north manila in luzon was islamized during the reign of sultan bolkiah in 1485 to 1521 this was accomplished because the sultanate of brunei subjugated tondo by defeating rajah gambang in battle and thereafter installing the muslim rajah rajah salalila to the throne and by establishing the bruneian puppet-state of the rajahnate of maynila.80818283 sultan bolkiah also married laila mecana the daughter of sulu sultan amir ul-ombra to expand brunei's influence in both luzon and mindanao.84 the muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the visayans.85 participating in the muslim raids the sultanate of ternate consequently destroyed the kedatuan of dapitan in bohol.86 the rajahnates of butuan and cebu also endured slave raids from and waged wars against the sultanate of maguindanao.87 the rivalries between the datus rajahs sultans and lakans eventually eased spanish colonization furthermore the islands were sparsely populated88 due to consistent natural disasters89 and inter-kingdom conflicts therefore colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the spanish empire and were hispanicized and christianized.90 colonial era spanish rule they also defeated the chinese warlord limahong.9495 to counteract the islamization of the philippines the spanish then conducted the castilian war which was aimed against the sultanate of brunei9697 and war was also waged against the sultanate of ternate and tidore in response to ternatean slaving and piracy against spain's allies bohol and butuan.98 the spanish considered their war with the muslims in southeast asia an extension of the reconquista a centuries-long campaign to retake and rechristianize the spanish homeland which was invaded by the muslims of the umayyad caliphate the spanish expeditions into the philippines were also part of a larger ibero-islamic world conflict99 that included a rivalry with the ottoman caliphate which had a center of operations at its nearby vassal the sultanate of aceh.100 consequently fortifications were also set up in taiwan and the maluku islands these were abandoned and the spanish soldiers along with the newly christianized papuan natives of the moluccas withdrew back to the philippines in order to re-concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the japan-born ming-dynasty loyalist koxinga ruler of the kingdom of tungning.101 however the planned invasion was aborted meanwhile settlers were sent to the pacific islands of palau and the marianas.102 spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago from 1565 to 1821 the philippines was governed as a territory of the mexico-based viceroyalty of new spain and then was administered directly from madrid after the mexican war of independence the manila galleons the largest wooden ships ever built were constructed in bicol and cavite.103 the manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and from manila and acapulco.104 the galleons sailed once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th centuries.105 the manila galleons brought with them goods106 settlers107 and military reinforcements destined for the philippines from latin america.108 trade introduced foodstuffs such as maize tomatoes potatoes chili peppers chocolate and pineapples from mexico and peru within the philippines the marquisate of buglas was established and the rule of it was awarded to sebastian elcano and his crew the survivors of the first circumnavigation of the world as well as his descendants new towns were also created95 and catholic missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to christianity.109 they also founded schools a university hospitals and churches which were built along the earthquake baroque architectural style.110 to defend their settlements the spaniards constructed and manned a network of military fortresses called presidios across the archipelago.111 the spanish also decreed the introduction of free public schooling in 1863.112 as a result of these policies the philippine population increased exponentially.113114 in the 19th century philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within filipino society many spaniards born in the philippines criollos117 and those of mixed ancestry mestizos became wealthy and an influx of latin american immigrants118 opened up government positions traditionally held by spaniards born in the iberian peninsula peninsulares the ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 cavite mutiny that was a precursor to the philippine revolution.90119120121 american rule the americans then suppressed other rebellious sub-states mainly the waning sultanate of sulu as well as the insurgent tagalog republic the cantonal republic of negros in the visayas and the republic of zamboanga in mindanao.129130 during this era a renaissance in philippine culture occurred with the expansion of philippine cinema and literature.131132133 daniel burnham built an architectural plan for manila which would have transformed it into a modern city.134 in 1935 the philippines was granted commonwealth status with manuel quezon as president he designated a national language and introduced women's suffrage and land reform.135136 japanese rule from mid-1942 through mid-1944 the filipino guerrilla resistance138139 had been supplied and encouraged by u.s navy submarines and a few parachute drops so that the guerrillas could harass the japanese army and take control of the rural areas jungles and mountains  thus the japanese empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces.140 while remaining loyal to the united states many filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence eventually the largest naval battle in history according to gross tonnage sunk the battle of leyte gulf occurred when allied forces started the liberation of the philippines from the japanese empire.141142 allied troops defeated the japanese in 1945 by the end of the war it is estimated that over a million filipinos had died.143144145 postcolonial period on october 11 1945 the philippines became one of the founding members of the united nations.146 the following year on july 4 1946 the philippines was officially recognized by the united states as an independent nation through the treaty of manila during the presidency of manuel roxas.5 disgruntled remnants of the communist hukbalahap147 continued to roam the countryside but were put down by president elpidio quirino's successor ramon magsaysay.148149 magsaysay's successor carlos p garcia initiated the filipino first policy150 which was continued by diosdado macapagal with celebration of independence day moved from july 4 to june 12 the date of emilio aguinaldo's declaration151152 while furthering the claim on the eastern part of north borneo.153154 in 1965 macapagal lost the presidential election to ferdinand marcos early in his presidency marcos initiated numerous infrastructure projects but was accused of massive corruption and embezzling billions of dollars in public funds.155 nearing the end of his term marcos declared martial law on september 21 1972.156 this period of his rule was characterized by political repression censorship and human rights violations but the us were steadfast in their support.157 on august 21 1983 marcos chief rival opposition leader benigno aquino jr. was assassinated on the tarmac at manila international airport marcos eventually called snap presidential elections in 1986.158 marcos was proclaimed the winner but the results were widely regarded as fraudulent leading to the people power revolution marcos and his allies fled to hawaii and aquino's widow corazon aquino was recognized as president.158159 contemporary history the return of democracy and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt government corruption coup attempts disasters a persistent communist insurgency160 and a military conflict with moro separatists.161 during corazon aquino's administration u.s forces withdrew from the philippines due to the rejection of the u.s bases extension treaty162163 and leading to the official transfer of clark air base in november 1991 and subic bay to the government in december 1992.164165 the administration also faced a series of natural disasters including the eruption of mount pinatubo in june 1991.166167 after introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term aquino did not stand for re-election in arroyo's 9-year administration the economy experienced gdp growth from 4 in 2002 to 7 growth in 2007 with the completion of infrastructure projects like the lrt line 2 in 2004180 and managed to avoid the great recession.181 nevertheless it was tied with graft and political scandals like the hello garci

atmospheric river an atmospheric river ar is a narrow corridor or filament of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere atmospheric rivers consist of narrow bands of enhanced water vapor transport typically along the boundaries between large areas of divergent surface air flow including some frontal zones in association with extratropical cyclones that form over the oceans.1234 pineapple express storms are the most commonly represented and recognized type of atmospheric rivers they are given the name due to the warm water vapor plumes originating over the hawaiian tropics that follow a path towards california.56 atmospheric rivers have a central role in the global water cycle on any given day atmospheric rivers account for over 90 of the global meridional north-south water vapor transport yet they cover less than 10 of the earth's circumference.2 they also are the major cause of extreme precipitation events that cause severe flooding in many mid-latitude westerly coastal regions of the world including the west coast of north america1112138 western europe141516 and the west coast of north africa.3 the significance atmospheric rivers have for the control of coastal water budgets juxtaposed against their creation of detrimental floods can be constructed and studied by looking at california and the surrounding coastal region of the western united states in this region atmospheric rivers have contributed 30-50 of total annual rainfall.17 in conjunction californian land falling atmospheric rivers have been historically associated with approximately all major flooding events.58 the inconsistency of california's rainfall is due to the variability in strength and quantity of these storms which can produce strenuous effects on california's water budget the factors described above make california a perfect case study to show the importance of proper water management and prediction of these storms.6 see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

sts-132  sts-132 iss assembly flight ulf45 was a nasa space shuttle mission during which space shuttle atlantis docked with the international space station on 16 may 2010.6 sts-132 was launched from the kennedy space center on 14 may 2010.3 the primary payload was the russian rassvet mini-research module along with an integrated cargo carrier-vertical light deployable icc-vld atlantis landed at the kennedy space center on 26 may 2010 sts-132 was initially scheduled to be the final flight of atlantis provided that the sts-335/sts-135 launch on need rescue mission would not be needed however in february 2011 nasa declared that the final mission of atlantis and of the space shuttle program sts-135 would be flown regardless of the funding situation.7  contents  crewedit crew seat assignmentsedit mission payload edit mini-research module 1 mrm 1edit sts-132 carried the russian rassvet mini-research module 1 to the international space station.11 rassvet means dawn in russian the module was built by russian aerospace company energia.12 rassvet arrived at the kennedy space center ksc aboard an antonov 124 cargo plane on 17 december 2009 at about 13:00 est.13 after it was unloaded from the antonov the module was transported to an astrotech processing bay in cape canaveral to undergo preparations for launch an airlock and radiation heat exchanger to be used for outfitting the russian nauka module to be launched in 2012 a spare elbow part of the european robotic arm era and a portable work platform for science hardware for performing experiments in outer space were externally mounted on rassvet in its launch configuration.14 russian and us cargo to be delivered will also be accommodated inside the module the volume for cargo and science inside mrm1 is 5 cubic meters.15 rassvet was outfitted with iss standard grapple fixtures that allowed the module to be unloaded from the payload bay of atlantis using the station's robotic arm integrated cargo

sgant boom assembly an enhanced orbital replacement unit oru temporary platform eotp for the canadian dextre robotic arm extension video and power grapple fixtures pvgf and six new battery orus the six new batteries replaced older ones on the p6 truss of the iss the old batteries were placed on the icc-vld pallet for return to earth the eotp was built by macdonald dettwiler and associates ltd mda of brampton ontario canada for nasa.16 the icc-vld was berthed in the center of the shuttle's payload bay for both launch and reentry.17 other itemsedit in addition to the standard official flight kit ofk flown inside a locker on the mid-deck two light weight tool stowage assemblies were modified to fly memorabilia and then were stowed to the left and right of atlantis airlock in the shuttle's payload bay.18 a compact disk cd containing the digital copies of all entries submitted to nasa's space shuttle program commemorative patch contest19 was also flown aboard atlantis.20 the contest was organized by the space shuttle program to mark the end of the shuttle era the winning patch was designed by mr blake dumesnil of hamilton sundstrand johnson space center.21 a panel of nasa judges including shuttle program manager john shannon leroy cain and three other shuttle program managers including former astronaut john casper selected the winning patch from a pool of 85 entries by nasa employees and contractors seventeen handcrafted beads made by nine different artists across north america were also on board atlantis during the sts-132 mission.2223 nasa teamed up with beads of courage inc. an approved public charity to bring hope and inspiration to children coping with serious illnesses through the beads in space project the beads in space project is the brainchild of jamie newton an employee at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama the 17 beads weigh eight ounces and were selected after a contest organized by beads of courage that attracted 54 beads also on board atlantis was a 4-inch long wood sample of sir isaac newton's apple tree.24 the piece from the original tree that supposedly inspired newton's theory of gravity along with a picture of newton were taken into orbit by astronaut piers sellers the wood is part of the collection of the royal society archives in london and was returned there following the flight.25 additionally a flag from clarkson university potsdam new york flew on board shuttle atlantis.26 it was there in honor of sts-132 lead shuttle flight director michael l sarafin who is an alumnus of the clarkson university

space center mrm 1 in the astrotech payload processing facility icc-vld was first carried on sts-127 in july 2009 winner of the space shuttle program commemorative patch contest mission background and milestonesedit the mission marked nasa arranged a tweetup to cover the launch of the sts-132 mission 150 people attended the event from more than 30 us states the district of columbia puerto rico belgium the netherlands new zealand and the united kingdom the tweetup participants met with shuttle technicians managers engineers and astronauts took a tour of the kennedy space center and viewed the launch of atlantis.28 mission experimentsedit atlantis crew worked with several short-term experiments during their mission the shuttle transported new long-term experiments to the iss at the end of the mission atlantis returned some of the completed experiments from the iss short-term experiments included shuttle processingedit on 29 march 2010 workers attached et-136 to its solid rocket boosters a crane lifted the et into high bay no 1 inside the vab the day-long process was completed around 18:00 edt as the tank was bolted to atlantis's twin solid rocket boosters.35 atlantis rolled out of its processing bay opf-1 around 07:00 edt on 13 april 2010 the shuttle entered the vab around 11:00 edt for attachment to its external tank and solid rocket boosters.36 given that this was at the time believed to be atlantis final rollover for a mission the shuttle stopped for several hours en route to the vab allowing engineers and technicians to pose for photographs with the orbiter.37 the rollover occurred exactly 25 years after atlantis first arrived at the kennedy space center after a cross-country trip from the shuttle factory in palmdale california.38 the path to the rollover was without any incidents of major concern with only 22 interim problem reports iprs noted during atlantis flow since its return from the sts-129 mission in november 2009 sts-132's payload was installed in the shuttle's cargo bay on 25 april 2010.43 pad engineers preparing atlantis had noticed paint peeling from shuttle's main payload the mrm-1 module although the problem was declared to have no impact on the operation of mrm-1 it holds a potential threat of releasing debris on orbit.44 engineers also noted mrm-1 cycled its fire and smoke detector self test several times similar events occurred during atlantis sts-129 mission in november 2009 when shuttle and station crew were awakened consecutive nights by false depressurization and fire alarms that originated from the mrm-2 poisk module an agency-wide flight readiness review frr was held at ksc in florida on 5 may 2010 to discuss atlantis launch preparations at the end of the review top nasa managers made the decision to officially set the launch for 14 may 2010 at 14:20 edt.4546 nasa held a post news conference to brief about the results of the frr the briefing was broadcast on nasa tv and was attended by nasa's associate administrator for space operations william gerstenmaier space shuttle program manager john shannon and space shuttle launch director michael leinbach mr shannon mentioned that firstly ceramic inserts around atlantis windows and forward rocket pod were tested after an insert loosened during discovery's re-entry on sts-131 posing a potential impact threat the inserts had been re-installed on to atlantis using a thicker braided cord to reduce the chances of a backing out secondly it was mentioned that engineers had reviewed work to confirm that all systems on atlantis ku band antenna were in place the testing had been provoked after the failure of that communication system during sts-131 mr leinbach also acknowledged the skills and experience of the engineering teams and thanked the engineers who had successfully resolved hypergolic loading issues.47 hypergolics are chemicals that ignite when they come in contact with each other the propellants are used in the reaction control system that steers the shuttle in space a booster rocket segment that had first flown 25 years before on atlantis maiden flight sts-51-j was used to help fly sts-132.48 the aft dome on the left solid rocket booster that lifted off to support atlantis sts-132 mission first launched sts-51-j on 3 october 1985 including sts-132 18 of atlantis 32 flights were represented by the boosters segments launch preparationsedit atlantis astronauts traveled from johnson space center houston to the ksc launch site on 10 may 2010 to prepare for the launch the crew arriving in four northrop t-38 talon jets landed on the shuttle landing facility around 18:49 edt.49 the official countdown to liftoff started on 11 may 2010 after the countdown clocks at ksc were activated at 16:00 edt ticking backward from the t-43 hour mark program managers completed the l-2 mission management team mmt meeting on 12 may 2010.50 at the end of the 18-minute-long meeting management team officially cleared atlantis for launch nasa held a pre-launch news conference to reveal the outcomes of the mmt and to brief the press on the upcoming launch the news conference was attended by chair pre-launch mission management team mike moses mike leinbach and sts-132 weather officer todd mcnamara the weather officer spoke of a favorable launch weather forecast due to a high pressure weather pattern and despite a low cloud ceiling calling a 70 percent chance of favorable conditions at launch time he further elaborated on the predicted weather conditions at the transoceanic abort landing tal sites zaragoza and moron in spain and istres france in case of an emergency the space shuttle program mmt met at 04:15 edt on 14 may 2010 and gave a go to begin loading atlantis et with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen the fuel tanking operation began on time at 04:55 edt and was completed within three hours at 07:56 edt with replenishment fuel being added throughout the countdown crew preparations for the launch day began at 05:00 edt following an eight-hour overnight sleep an hour later they completed their final medical check ups crew suiting began around 10:00 edt and the astronauts departed for the launch pad at 10:30 edt at around 11:00 edt first commander ham ingressed the shuttle first and strapped into his seat followed by pilot antonelli mission specialists bowen sellers reisman and good in order inside the orbiter all six astronauts performed checks with ground controllers to verify that communications links work properly with all astronauts on board atlantis hatch was closed and latched for the flight inside the white room the closeout crew finished their job by pressurizing the crew cabin and checking for leaks before leaving the pad launch day countdown procedures went without any major problems however atlantis encountered two minor issues the final inspection team looking for ice and frost buildup on the et had spotted a small stress fracture on an umbilical strut later during the post-launch news conference the chair of nasa's pre-launch mission management team mike moses said that this was not unusual engineers also resolved any concerns about a loose ball bearing found near the shuttle's payload bay days earlier the bearing was determined to likely be from a camera system and was ultimately ruled out as a concern mission timelineedit 14 may flight day 1  launchedit nasa held a post-launch news conference with bill gerstenmaier alexey krasnov chief of the piloted programs directorate at the russian federal space agency mike moses and mike leinbach during the conference gerstenmaier made mention of a piece of space junk that could potentially have impacted atlantis planned arrival at the iss.54 more than 39000 guests including television host david letterman ex-apollo astronaut buzz aldrin and former nasa administrator michael griffin witnessed the launch.55 the russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the head of the russian space federal agency anatoly perminov were also present at ksc.56 once in orbit the crew opened the shuttle's payload bay doors activated the radiators and deployed the ku band antenna successfully they also completed a checkout of the orbiter's shuttle remote manipulator system srms the crew was also successful in downlinking all imagery from atlantis umbilical well cameras along with crew video of et-136 for review by imagery experts in the ground.57 preliminary inspections showed that et-136 was very clean and had performed well during the ascent with only a few foam liberation incidents visible 15 may flight day 2  tps surveyedit commander kenneth ham installed the center-line camera in the orbiter docking system ods to help him during atlantis approach to the iss down on the shuttle's middeck good and bowen spent several hours checking out spacesuits and preparing them for transfer to the station reisman spent much of his day working with antonelli and ham on the tps survey he also assisted with the suit and spacewalk equipment checkouts the crew furthermore performed the ods ring extension that would connect the shuttle's docking port to the station's harmony module the last portion of the crew's day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools to be used during the rendezvous meanwhile mission control managers determined that the iss would not need an avoidance maneuver to avoid a piece of orbital debris updated tracking information showed that the iss and the debris would not pass close enough the following day to require any action snagged cable in the sensor package pan and tilt unit garrett big g reisman in the middeck of atlantis blue and white part of earth as photographed by a crew member tony antonelli 16 may flight

the shuttle's underside rotated into view three iss crew members  oleg kotov using a camera with a 400mm lens and timothy creamer and soichi noguchi using two 800mm-lens cameras  took 398 photographs of atlantis belly as part of post-launch inspections of the thermal protection system sellers and expedition 23/24 astronaut tracy caldwell dyson got to work on their joint task to relocate the icc-vld cargo pallet.66 the duo used the station's robotic arm to transfer the pallet from atlantis to the station's mobile base system to prepare for the spacewalks in preparation for the following day's spacewalk all atlantis crew members gathered for an hour-long spacewalk procedure review mission specialists reisman and bowen spent the night in the quest airlock as part of the overnight campout procedure to help them get prepared for the spacewalk the crewlock was depressurized from 14.7 to 10.2 psi the depressurization was required to avoid the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the astronauts blood which could result in decompression sickness flying above the atlantic coast of spain and the gulf of cadiz atlantis approaches the iss for docking underside of atlantis is revealed during the rpm atlantis docks with the space station 4 mins 30 secs flight day 3 highlights 26 mins 1 sec 17 may flight day 4  eva 1edit after the morning wakeup call mission control capcom shannon lucid informed the shuttle crew that no detailed flight inspection would be required on the next day however the crew were requested to utilize that time to do inspections on various sections of atlantis that were not inspected on flight day 2 flight day 4 saw mission specialists garret reisman and steve bowen perform the first of three planned spacewalks.67 the pair installed a spare space to ground antenna sgant a new enhanced tool platform for the special purpose dexterous manipulator spdm also known as dextre and released torque on the six new batteries for the port 6 p6 truss segment expedition 23 flight engineer creamer helped the duo with their suit-up preparations mike good joined sts-132 pilot antonelli the intravehicular officer to assist during the spacewalk mission specialist sellers and station flight engineer caldwell dyson operated the robotic arm.68 throughout eva 1 commander ken ham oversaw the extravehicular activities during the spacewalk several problems were encountered69 the first of which was during installation of the sgant a slight gap was observed between the antenna dish and its mounting pole the spacewalkers loosened the bolts and used a higher torque setting which managed to close the gap to a smaller width the launch locks were left on the sgant to allow engineers on the ground to determine if the gap was acceptable or if more troubleshooting would be needed the second problem occurred during the installation of the sgant and was related to the command and control cnc computers.70 during installation when steve bowen removed a cover from a connector the prime cnc computer detected an error and shut down the cap was a special cap which allowed the circuit for that connector to be closed so when it was opened the sensor detected an error the shut down of the cnc caused a 2-minute loss of communications the safeing of the computer also stopped the canadarm2 for a reconfiguration of the cameras being used during the spacewalk by both the robotic arm operators and observers on the ground.71 the spacewalk ended at 19:19 utc after reisman and bowen made an inventory of the tools they brought with them and made their way back into the quest airlock sts-132's eva 1 was the 237th conducted by u.s astronauts the second for reisman and the fourth for bowen it was also the 144th in support of iss assembly and maintenance for eva 1 lead spacewalker reisman had a spacesuit with no stripes bowen spacesuit was marked with a red stripe the shuttle's robotic arm also successfully grappled the mrm-1 module in

bowen works on the installation of the ku band antenna system 18 may flight day 5  mrm1 installationedit on flight day 5 the crew focused on the addition of the mrm-1 module to the space station.72 commander ken ham and pilot tony antonelli maneuvered atlantis robotic arm to unberth mrm-1 from the shuttle's payload bay at 09:49 utc and handed it off to the station's canadarm2 at 10:14 utc mission specialists garrett reisman and piers sellers working from inside the station's cupola then maneuvered the canadarm2 arm to deliver mrm-1 to its new position the earth-facing port of the zarya service module the docking occurred at 12:20 utc73 when the shuttle-station stack was flying above argentina following the successful docking sellers reported to mission control that during the docking he did not see the expected capture 1 confirmation signal appear on his laptop to which capcom steve swanson replied and station that error's expected the reason you didn't get 'contact 1 is because garrett did too good of a job flying he went right down the middle and got a hole in one.74 expedition 23 commander oleg kotov also monitored the activities from the russian segment as the mrm-1 began its automated docking sequence for the final attachment to the zarya module the berthing marked the first time that the russian automated docking system has been used along with the station's robotic arm at 17:20 utc shuttle crew members ham reisman sellers along with station crew members kotov skvortsov and caldwell dyson gathered in the space station's harmony module to talk with reporters from msnbc fox news and cnn.75 the two crews answered questions related to their stay in orbit medical experiments being conducted on the iss spacewalking experiences and the gulf of mexico oil spill.76 after midday reisman and sellers used canadarm2 to unberth the obss from the sill of atlantis cargo bay and handed it off to the shuttle's robotic arm operated by ham and antonelli mission specialists bowen and good prepared for next day's eva 2 configuring their tools and preparing their spacesuits at the end of the workday atlantis crew along with three station crew members met for an hour-long spacewalk procedure review at 21:45 utc good and bowen began their campout inside the quest airlock with pressure reduced to 10.2 psi to reduce the risk of decompression sickness

the mission's second spacewalk eva 2 was to remove and replace batteries on the station's port 6 truss.77 the spacewalk got under way at 10:38 utc78 more than 25 minutes ahead of the scheduled start which already had been moved up 30 minutes lead spacewalker bowen's first task was to remove a cable snag in the obss's pan and tilt mechanism bowen looped a tie wrap on two cables to relieve the snag and completed the task in less than 30 minutes while good began work with the batteries.79 although the initial plan was to replace three batteries the two astronauts managed to replace an additional fourth battery during eva 2 the batteries bowen and good replaced had originally been launched in november 2000 after the battery work and cleanup of the area bowen and good moved on to the new backup ku band antenna on the z1 truss they tightened bolts holding the antenna's dish to its boom closing a gap left there after eva 1 good performed a wiggle test and confirmed that two spacewalkers did not see any signs of motion in the antenna-mast interface they then removed the antenna's launch locks leaving the antenna ready to operate.80 during eva 2 commander ken ham provided photo and television support and pilot tony antonelli served as the spacewalk choreographer iss crew member tracy caldwell dyson also assisted with spacewalk preparations eva 2 marked the 238th conducted by u.s astronauts the fifth for bowen and the third for good it was also the 145th in support of international space station assembly and maintenance 20 may flight day 7  mrm-1 initial checks transfers and off-dutyedit on flight day 7 the crew spent a few hours of off-duty time in the afternoon but otherwise were largely focused on preparations for eva 3 earlier in the day at 10:52 utc following leak checks iss expedition 23 commander oleg kotov and flight engineer alexander skvortsov opened the hatch to the mrm-1 module.81 they wore eye and breathing protection as a standard precaution when entering a new module kotov reported that some metal filings were drifting around inside the new module as unpacking activities gathered pace although initially he reported the interior of mrm-1 looked clean flight controllers both in houston and moscow worked with the crew to develop a technique for safely removing the floating debris at 12:25 utc shuttle crew members ken ham tony antonelli piers sellers and iss flight engineer tracy caldwell dyson talked with the associated press fox news radio and cbs news.82 ham also joined in with past and present members of mission control to recognize lonnie j schmitt as the first flight controller to reach his 100th shuttle mission during the day ham antonelli and sellers transferred equipment supplies and experiments between atlantis

wind wind is the flow of gases on a large scale on the surface of the earth wind consists of the bulk movement of air in outer space solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the sun through space while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale their speed the types of forces that cause them the regions in which they occur and their effect the strongest observed winds on a planet in the solar system occur on neptune and saturn winds have various aspects an important one being its velocity wind speed another the density of the gas involved another its energy content or wind energy in meteorology winds are often referred to according to their strength and the direction from which the wind is blowing short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts strong winds of intermediate duration around one minute are termed squalls long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength such as breeze gale storm and hurricane wind occurs on a range of scales from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on earth the two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles and the rotation of the planet coriolis effect within the tropics thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations in coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds in areas that have variable terrain mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds in human civilization wind has inspired mythology influenced the events of history expanded the range of transport and warfare and provided a power source for mechanical work electricity and recreation wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across earth's oceans hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft when winds become strong trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed winds can shape landforms via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils such as loess and by erosion dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions wind also affects the spread of wildfires winds can disperse seeds from various plants enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species as well as flying insect populations when combined with cold temperatures wind has a negative impact on livestock wind affects animals food stores as well as their hunting and defensive strategies  contents  causesedit wind is caused by differences in the atmospheric pressure when a difference in atmospheric pressure exists air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area resulting in winds of various speeds on a rotating planet air will also be deflected by the coriolis effect except exactly on the equator globally the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns the atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces and the rotation of the planet outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance near the earth's surface friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.12 winds defined by an equilibrium of physical forces are used in the decomposition and analysis of wind profiles they are useful for simplifying the atmospheric equations of motion and for making qualitative arguments about the horizontal and vertical distribution of winds the geostrophic wind component is the result of the balance between coriolis force and pressure gradient force it flows parallel to isobars and approximates the flow above the atmospheric boundary layer in the midlatitudes.3 the thermal wind is the difference in the geostrophic wind between two levels in the atmosphere it exists only in an atmosphere with horizontal temperature gradients.4 the ageostrophic wind component is the difference between actual and geostrophic wind which is responsible for air filling up cyclones over time.5 the gradient wind is similar to the geostrophic wind but also includes centrifugal force or centripetal acceleration.6 measurementedit wind direction is usually expressed in terms of the direction from which it originates for example a northerly wind blows from the north to the south.7 weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind.8 at airports windsocks indicate wind direction and can also be used to estimate wind speed by the angle of hang.9 wind speed is measured by anemometers most commonly using rotating cups or propellers when a high measurement frequency is needed such as in research applications wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire.10 another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure which is then used to compute the wind speed.11 to determine winds aloft rawinsondes determine wind speed by gps radio navigation or radar tracking of the probe.16 alternatively movement of the parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites.17 remote sensing techniques for wind include sodar doppler lidars and radars which can measure the doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules and radiometers and radars can be used to measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next wind engineering describes the study of the effects of the wind on the built environment including buildings bridges and other man-made objects wind force scaleedit enhanced fujita scaleedit the enhanced fujita scale ef scale rates the strength of tornadoes in the united states based on the damage they cause

steel-reinforced concrete structures are critically damaged tall buildings collapse or have severe structural deformations station modeledit the station model plotted on surface weather maps uses a wind barb to show both wind direction and speed the wind barb shows the speed using flags on the end wind poweredit differentiating with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy we find that the total wind power is wind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity theoretical power captured by a wind turbineedit total wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero in a realistic wind turbine this is impossible as the captured air must also leave the turbine a relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered using the concept of stream tube the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is 59 of the total theoretical wind power25 see betz law practical wind turbine poweredit further insufficiencies such as rotor blade friction and drag gearbox losses generator and converter losses reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine the basic relation that the turbine power is approximately proportional to the third power of velocity remains global climatologyedit easterly winds on average dominate the flow pattern across the poles westerly winds blow across the mid-latitudes of the earth polewards of the subtropical ridge while easterlies again dominate the tropics directly under the subtropical ridge are the doldrums or horse latitudes where winds are lighter many of the earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge where descent reduces the relative humidity of the air mass.26 the strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics tropicsedit the trade winds also called trades are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics towards the earth's equator.27 the trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the northern hemisphere and from the southeast in the southern hemisphere.28 the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical cyclones that form over the world's oceans.29 trade winds also steer african dust westward across the atlantic ocean into the caribbean as well as portions of southeast north america.30 a monsoon is a seasonal prevailing wind that lasts for several months within tropical regions the term was first used in english in india bangladesh pakistan and neighboring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the indian ocean and arabian sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area.31 its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off a heat low over the asian african and north american continents during may through july and over australia in december.323334 westerlies and their impactedit polar easterliesedit the polar easterlies also known as polar hadley cells are dry cold prevailing winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at the north and south poles towards the low-pressure areas within the westerlies at high latitudes unlike the westerlies these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west and are often weak and irregular.42 because of the low sun angle cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas forcing an equatorward outflow of air;43 that outflow is deflected westward by the coriolis effect local considerationsedit sea and land breezesedit at night the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their specific heat values this temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate when the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land establishing a land breeze as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.45 near mountainsedit over elevated surfaces heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed4647 and changing the wind circulation of the region in areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow the wind circulation between mountains and valleys is the most important contributor to the prevailing winds hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography which is known as a barrier jet this barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%.48 wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.49 if there is a pass in the mountain range winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure the airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside these conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes.49 cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names in central america examples include the papagayo wind the panama wind and the tehuano wind in europe similar winds are known as the bora tramontane and mistral when these winds blow over open waters they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool nutrient rich waters to the surface which leads to increased marine life.50 average wind speedsedit as described earlier prevailing and local winds are not spread evenly across the earth which means that wind speeds also differ by region in addition the wind speed also increases with the altitude wind power densityedit shearedit wind shear sometimes referred to as windshear or wind gradient is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the earth's atmosphere.59 wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast60 and vertical shear typically near the surface61 though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.62 wind shear itself is a microscale meteorological phenomenon occurring over a very small distance but it can be associated with mesoscale or synoptic scale weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts it is commonly observed near microbursts and downbursts caused by thunderstorms63 weather fronts areas of locally higher low level winds referred to as low level jets near mountains64 radiation inversions that occur because of clear skies and calm winds buildings65 wind turbines66 and sailboats.67 wind shear has a significant effect during take-off and landing of aircraft because of their effects on control of the aircraft68 and was a significant cause of aircraft accidents involving large loss of life within the united states.63 sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear which can bend the wave front causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not or vice versa.69 strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development70 but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather.71 the thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences and explains the existence of the jet stream.72 usageedit historyedit transportationedit there are many different forms of sailing ships but they all have certain basic things in common except for rotor ships using the magnus effect every sailing ship has a hull rigging and at least one mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship.83 ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months84 and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind85 or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction.86 a severe storm could lead to shipwreck and the loss of all hands.87 sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions including fresh water.88 for aerodynamic aircraft which operate relative to the air winds affect groundspeed89 and in the case of lighter-than-air vehicles wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track.90 the velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport and airfield runways are aligned to account for the common wind directions of the local area while taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances a headwind is generally desirable a tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.91 power sourceedit recreationedit wind figures prominently in several popular sports including recreational hang gliding hot air ballooning kite flying snowkiting kite landboarding kite surfing paragliding sailing and windsurfing in gliding wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches also known as winch launches or wire launches if the wind gradient is significant or sudden or both and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude the indicated airspeed will increase possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed the pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.98 when landing wind shear is also a hazard particularly when the winds are strong as the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing airspeed decreases while sink rate increases and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact the pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.99 role in the natural worldedit in arid climates the main source of erosion is wind.100 the general wind circulation moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin101 which is known as deflation westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds spores pollen etc although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants erosionedit erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind there are two main effects first wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region this is called deflation second these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion ecological succession wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation an example is the formation of sand dunes on a beach or in a desert.102 loess is a homogeneous typically nonstratified porous friable slightly coherent often calcareous fine-grained silty pale yellow or buff windblown aeolian sediment.103 it generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.104 loess tends to develop into highly rich soils under appropriate climatic conditions areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world.105 loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature and will erode very readily therefore windbreaks such as big trees and bushes are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.100 desert dust migrationedit during mid-summer july in the northern hemisphere the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the caribbean into southeastern north america when dust from the sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates.106 over 50 of the african dust that reaches the united states affects florida.107 since 1970 dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in africa there is a large variability in the dust transport to the caribbean and florida from year to year.108 dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the caribbean and florida primarily since the 1970s.109 similar dust plumes originate in the gobi desert which combined with pollutants spread large distances downwind or eastward into north america.101 there are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms the calima carries dust on southeast winds into the canary islands.110 the harmattan carries dust during the winter into the gulf of guinea.111 the sirocco brings dust from north africa into southern europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the mediterranean.112 spring storm systems moving across the eastern mediterranean sea cause dust to carry across egypt and the arabian peninsula which are locally known as khamsin.113 the shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the persian gulf states.114 effect on plantsedit wind dispersal of seeds or anemochory is one of the more primitive means of dispersal wind dispersal can take on one of two primary forms seeds can float on the breeze or alternatively they can flutter to the ground.115 the classic examples of these dispersal mechanisms include dandelions taraxacum spp. asteraceae which have a feathery pappus attached to their seeds and can be dispersed long distances and maples acer genus spp. sapindaceae which have winged seeds and flutter to the ground an important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for germination there are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism for instance species in the asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities i.e. larger seed mass and smaller pappus relative to the same species on the mainland.116 reliance upon wind dispersal is common among many weedy or ruderal species unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include tumbleweeds a related process to anemochory is anemophily which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind large families of plants are pollinated in this manner which is favored when individuals of the dominant plant species are spaced closely together.117 effect on animalsedit sound generationedit wind causes the generation of sound the movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects such as leaves or grass these objects will produce sound if they touch each other even a soft wind will cause a low level of environmental noise if the wind is blowing harder it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies this may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object.134 especially on high buildings many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions examples of these parts are balconies ventilation openings roof openings or cables related damageedit in outer spaceedit the solar wind is quite different from a terrestrial wind in that its origin is the sun and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere similar to the solar wind the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres over long periods of time the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres planetary windedit the hydrodynamic wind within the upper portion of a planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to move up to the exobase the lower limit of the exosphere where the gases can then reach escape velocity entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas this type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind.146 such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the earth to evolve into planets like venus.147 additionally planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.148 solar

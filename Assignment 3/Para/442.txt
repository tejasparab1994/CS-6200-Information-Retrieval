united states naval research laboratory  contents  researchedit the naval research laboratory conducts a wide variety of basic and scientific research and technological development of importance to the navy it has a long history of scientific breakthroughs and technological achievements dating back to its foundation in 1923.3 in many instances the laboratory's contributions to military technology are declassified decades after those technologies have become widely adopted in 2011 nrl researchers published 1398 unclassified scientific  technical articles book chapters and conference proceedings.2 in 2008 the nrl was ranked no 3 among all u.s institutions holding nanotechnology-related patents behind ibm and the university of california.4 current areas of research at nrl include:2 the laboratory houses a wide range of r&d facilities the most recent additions include the nrl nanoscience institute's 5000sqft class 100 nanofabrication cleanroom6 and quiet measurement labs and the laboratory for autonomous systems research lasr.7 notable accomplishmentsedit space sciencesedit the naval research laboratory has a long and ongoing history of major contributions to spacecraft development it placed the second fifth and seventh american satellites in earth orbit including the first solar-powered satellite the first surveillance satellite the first meteorological satellite and the first gps satellite project vanguard the first american satellite program tasked nrl with the design construction and launch of an artificial satellite which was accomplished in 1958 as of 2013 vanguard i is still in orbit making it the longest-lived man-made satellite vanguard ii was the first satellite to observe the earth's cloud cover and therefore the first meteorological satellite nrl's recently declassified galactic radiation and background i grab i was the first u.s intelligence satellite mapping out soviet radar networks from space the global positioning system gps was invented at nrl and tested by nrl's timation series of satellites the first operational gps satellite timation iv nts-ii was designed and constructed at nrl.8 nrl pioneered the study of the sun ultraviolet and x-ray spectrum and continues to contribute to the field with satellites like coriolis satellite launched in 2003 nrl is also responsible for the tactical satellite program with spacecraft launched in 2006 2009 and 2011 along with project vanguard nrl also designed the first satellite tracking system minitrack which became the prototype for future satellite tracking networks prior to the success of surveillance satellites the iconic parabolic antenna atop nrl's main headquarters in washington d.c was part of communication moon relay a project that succeeded in sending and receiving signals bounced off the moon both for long-distance communications research and surveillance of internal soviet transmissions during the cold war meteorologyedit the marine meteorology division which is located in monterey california makes important contributions to weather forecasting in the united states and around the world by making publicly available imagery from 18 weather satellites satellite images of hurricanes and cyclones that provide advanced warning of impending severe weather often originate the from naval research lab monterey as seen recently during hurricane harvey 9 nrl is also involved in weather forecasting models such as the hurricane weather research and forecasting model released in 2007 nrl's spacecraft development program continues today with the tacsat-4 experimental tactical reconnaissance  communication satellite in addition to spacecraft design nrl also designs and operates research instruments such as the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph experiment lasco10 aboard the solar and heliospheric observatory soho nasa's gamma-ray large area space telescope glast was tested at nrl spacecraft testing facilities.11 nrl scientists have most recently contributed leading research to the study of novas1213 and gamma ray bursts.14151617 materials scienceedit nrl has a long history of contributions to materials science dating back to the use of industrial radiography with gamma rays for the nondestructive inspection of metal casings and welds on navy vessels beginning in the 1920s modern mechanical fracture mechanics were pioneered at nrl and were subsequently applied to solve fracture problems in navy vessels commercial aircraft and polaris missiles that knowledge is in widespread use today in applications ranging from design of nuclear reactors to aircraft submarines and toxic material storage tanks.3 nrl developed the synthesis of high-purity gaas crystals used in a myriad of modern high frequency transceivers including cellular phones satellite communication systems commercial and military radar systems including those aboard all us combat aircraft and arm phoenix aim-9l and amraam missiles nrl's gaas inventions were licensed by rockwell westinghouse texas instruments and hughes research.18 high-purity gaas is also used for high-efficiency solar cells like those aboard nasa's spirit and opportunity rovers currently on mars.19 fundamental aspects of stealth technology were developed at nrl including the radar absorption mechanisms in ferrite-containing materials.18 metal bearing surface treatments using cr ion implantation researched at nrl nearly tripled the service life of navy turbine engine parts and was adopted for army helicopter parts as well.18 fluorinated polyurethane coatings developed at nrl are used to line fuel storage tanks throughout the us navy reducing leakage and environmental and fuel contamination the same polymer films are used in los angeles-class submarine radomes to repel water and enable radar operation soon after surfacing.18 scientists at nrl frequently contribute theoretical and experimental research on novel materials202122 particularly magnetic materials232425262728 and nanomaterials29303132 and thermoplastic.33 radaredit the first modern u.s radar was invented and developed at nrl in washington dc in 1922 by 1939 nrl installed the first operational radar aboard the uss new york in time for radar to contribute to naval victories of the coral sea midway and guadalcanal nrl then further developed over-the-horizon radar as well as radar data displays.3 nrl's radar division34 continues important research  development contributing to us navy and us department of defense capabilities tactical electronic warfareedit nrl's tactical electronic warfare tew division35 is responsible for research and development in support of the navy's tactical electronic warfare requirements and missions these include electronic warfare support measures electronic countermeasures and supporting counter-countermeasures as well as studies analyses and simulations for determining and improving the performance of electronic warfare systems nrl tew includes aerial surface and ground ew within its scope nrl is responsible for the identification friend or foe iff system and a number of other advances information securityedit the information technology division36 has a world-class information security r&d group which is where the ietf's ip security ipsec protocols were originally developed the encapsulating security payload esp protocol developed at nrl is widely used for virtual private network vpn connections worldwide.37 the projects developed by the laboratory often become mainstream applications without public awareness of the developer an example in computer science is onion routing the core principle of the anonymizing tor software.38 nuclear researchedit nuclear power research was initiated at nrl as early as 19393 six years before the first atomic bomb for the purpose of powering submarines uranium enrichment methods sponsored by nrl over the course of world war ii were adopted by the manhattan project39 and guided the design of oak ridge national laboratory's uranium enrichment plant nrl is currently developing laser focusing techniques aimed at inertial confinement fusion technology.40 physical sciencesedit the static discharger seen on trailing edges of virtually all modern aircraft was originally developed by nrl scientists during world war ii after the war the laboratory developed modern synthetic lubricants4142 initially for use in the navy's jet aircraft but they were subsequently adopted by the commercial jet industry.3 in the late 1960s nrl researched low-temperature physics achieving for the first time a temperature within one millionth of a degree of absolute zero in 1967 in 1985 two scientists at the laboratory herbert a hauptman and jerome karle won the nobel prize for devising direct methods employing x-ray diffraction analysis in the determination of crystal structures.43 their methods form the basis for the computer packages used in pharmaceutical labs and research institutions worldwide for the analysis of more than 10000 new substances each year.44 nrl has most recently published research on quantum computing4546 quantum dots47 plasma shockwaves48 thermodynamics of liquids49 modeling of oil spills50 and other topics nrl operates a small squadron of research aircraft termed scientific development squadron one vxs-1 its missions include for example rampant lion which used sophisticated airborne instrumentation gravimeters magnetometers and hyperspectral cameras to collect precise 3d topography of two-thirds of aghanistan and locate natural resources underground gas and mineral deposits vegetation types etc there 51 and in iraq and colombia 52 plasma scienceedit the division of plasma science conducts research and development into ionized matter nrl currently holds the world record for most energetic rail gun projectile 33 mj 53 and fastest manmade projectile 334 million mph 54 organizationedit the laboratory is divided into four research directorates one financial directorate and one executive directorate all the directorates are headquartered in washington d.c many directorates have other facilities elsewhere primarily at either the stennis space center in bay st louis mississippi or in monterey california staffedit most nrl staff are civilians in the civil service with a relatively small number of navy enlisted personnel or officers in addition there are some support contractors that work on-site at nrl as of 31 december 2015 across all nrl locations nrl had 2540 civilian employees i.e. not including civilian contractors.55 on the same date there were 35 military officers on-board nrl and 58 enlisted on-board nrl most of whom are with nrl's vxs-1 scientific flight detachment which is located aboard the patuxent river 'pax river' naval air station nas in southern maryland.56 nrl has special authority to use a pay-band pay system instead of using the traditional general schedule gs pay system for its civilian employees.5758 this gives nrl more ability to pay employees based on performance and merit rather than time-in-grade or some other seniority metric there are several different pay-band groups at nrl each being for different categories of civilian employees as of 31 december 2015 nrl had 1615 civilian scientists/engineers in the np pay system 103 civilian technicians in the nr pay system 383 civilian administrative specialists/professionals in the no pay system and 238 civilian administrative support staff in the nc pay system.56 nrl scientists  engineers typically are in the np pay group in nrl's pay band system.57 the np-ii pay band is equivalent to gs-5 step 1 through gs-10 step 10 the np-iii pay band is equivalent to gs-11 step 1 through gs-13 step 10 nrl's pay band iv corresponds to the gs-14 step 1 to gs-15 step 10 pay grades inclusive while nrl's pay band v can pay above gs-15 step 10 and corresponds to the senior technologist st pay grade elsewhere in the us government's civil service a new graduate scientist or engineer with a bachelor of science degree typically is hired with a salary equivalent to a gs-7 while a new graduate scientist or engineer with a master of science degree typically at the equivalent of a gs-11 according to the nrl fact book 2016 nrl had 870 employees with a doctorate 417 employees with a master's degree as their highest degree and 576 employees with a bachelor's degree as their highest degree.56 the laboratory also hosts post-doctoral researchers and was voted #15 in the best places to work postdocs 2013 survey.59 research directoratesedit the four research directorates within nrl are support directoratesedit the two support directorates are locationsedit the main campus of nrl is in washington dc near the southernmost part of the district it is on the potomac river and is immediately south of but is not part of joint base anacostia-bolling this campus is immediately north of the blue plains site of the dc water authority exit 1 of northbound i-295 leads directly to overlook avenue and the nrl main gate in addition nrl operates several field sites and satellite facilities:262 historyedit early historyedit artifacts found on the nrl campus such as stone tools and ceramic shards show that the site had been inhabited since the late archaic period cecil calvert 2nd baron baltimore granted the tract of land including the present nrl campus to william middleton in 1663 it became part of the district of columbia in 1791 and was purchased by thomas grafton addison in 1795 who named the area bellevue and built a mansion on the highlands to the east zachariah berry purchased the land in 1827 who rented it out for various purposes including a fishery at blue plains the mansion was demolished during the civil war to build fort greble in 1873 the land was purchased by the federal government as the bellevue annex to the naval gun factory and several buildings were constructed including the commandant's house quarters a which is still in use today.65 foundationedit the naval research laboratory came into existence from an idea that originated from thomas edison in a may 1915 editorial piece in the new york times magazine edison wrote the government should maintain a great research laboratory.. in this could be developed...all the technique of military and naval progression without any vast expense.66 this statement addressed concerns about world war i in the united states.67 the u.s naval research laboratory the first modern research institution created within the united states navy began operations at 1100 on 2 july 1923 the laboratory's two original divisions  radio and sound  performed research in the fields of high-frequency radio and underwater sound propagation.67 they produced communications equipment direction-finding devices sonar sets and perhaps most significant of all the first practical radar equipment built in the united states they performed basic research participating for example in the discovery and early exploration of the ionosphere moreover the nrl was able to work gradually toward its goal of becoming a broadly based research facility by the beginning of world war ii five new divisions had been added physical optics chemistry metallurgy mechanics and electricity and internal communications.67 world war ii years and growthedit after wwiiedit as a result of the scientific accomplishments of the wwii the united states emerged into the postwar era determined to consolidate its wartime gains in science and technology and to preserve the working relationship between its armed forces and the scientific community while the navy was establishing the office of naval research onr as a liaison with and supporter of basic and applied scientific research the navy encouraged nrl to broaden its scope since it was the navy department's corporate research laboratory nrl was placed under the administrative oversight of onr after onr was created nrl's commanding officer reports to the navy's chief of naval research cnr the chief of naval research leads the office of naval research which primarily is located in the ballston area of arlington virginia the reorganization also caused a parallel shift of the laboratory's emphasis to one of long-range basic and applied research in the full range of the physical sciences.2 however rapid expansion during the war had left nrl improperly structured to address long-term navy requirements one major task  neither easily nor rapidly accomplished  was that of reshaping and coordinating research this was achieved by transforming a group of largely autonomous scientific divisions into a unified institution with a clear mission and a fully coordinated research program the first attempt at reorganization vested power in an executive committee composed of all the division superintendents this committee was impracticably large so in 1949 a civilian director of research was named and given full authority over the program positions for associate directors were added in 1954.2 modern eraedit in 1992 the previously separate naval oceanographic and atmospheric research laboratory noarl with centers in bay st louis mississippi and monterey california was merged into nrl since then nrl is also the lead navy center for research in oceanographic and atmospheric sciences with special strengths in physical oceanography marine geosciences ocean acoustics marine meteorology and remote oceanic and atmospheric sensing.67 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects

severe weather severe weather refers to any dangerous meteorological phenomena with the potential to cause damage serious social disruption or loss of human life.1 types of severe weather phenomena vary depending on the latitude altitude topography and atmospheric conditions high winds hail excessive precipitation and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather as are thunderstorms downbursts tornadoes waterspouts tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards snowstorms ice storms and duststorms.2  contents  terminologyedit meteorologists generally define severe weather as any aspect of the weather that poses risks to life property or requires the intervention of authorities a narrower definition of severe weather is any weather phenomena relating to severe thunderstorms.23 according to the world meteorological organization wmo severe weather can be categorized into two groups general severe weather and localized severe weather.1 nor'easters european wind storms and the phenomena that accompany them form over wide geographic areas these occurrences are classified as general severe weather.1 downbursts and tornadoes are more localized and therefore have a more limited geographic effect these forms of weather are classified as localized severe weather.1 the term severe weather is technically not the same phenomenon as extreme weather extreme weather describes unusual weather events that are at the extremes of the historical distribution for a given area.4 causesedit organized severe weather occurs from the same conditions that generate ordinary thunderstorms atmospheric moisture lift often from thermals and instability.5 a wide variety of conditions cause severe weather several factors can convert thunderstorms into severe weather for example a pool of cold air aloft may aid in the development of large hail from an otherwise innocuous appearing thunderstorm however the most severe hail and tornadoes are produced by supercell thunderstorms and the worst downbursts and derechos straight-line winds are produced by bow echoes both of these types of storms tend to form in environments high in wind shear.5 floods hurricanes tornadoes and thunderstorms are considered to be the most destructive weather-related natural disasters although these weather phenomena are all related to cumulonimbus clouds they form and develop under different conditions and geographic locations the relationship between these weather events and their formation requirements are used to develop models to predict the most frequent and possible locations this information is used to notify affected areas and save lives categoriesedit severe thunderstorms can be assessed in three different categories these are approaching severe severe and significantly severe both severe and significant severe events warrant a severe thunderstorm warning from the united states national weather service excludes flash floods the environment canada the australian bureau of meteorology or the meteorological service of new zealand if the event occurs in those countries if a tornado is occurring a tornado has been seen by spotters or is imminent doppler weather radar has observed strong rotation in a storm indicating an incipient tornado the severe thunderstorm warning will be superseded by a tornado warning in the united states and canada.9 a severe weather outbreak is typically considered to be when ten or more tornadoes some of which will likely be long-tracked and violent and many large hail or damaging wind reports occur within one or more consecutive days severity is also dependent on the size of the geographic area affected whether it covers hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.10 high windsedit high winds are known to cause damage depending upon their strength wind gusts may cause poorly designed suspension bridges to sway when wind gusts harmonize with the frequency of the swaying bridge the bridge may fail as occurred with the tacoma narrows bridge in 1940.13 hurricane-force winds caused by individual thunderstorms thunderstorm complexes derechos tornadoes extratropical cyclones or tropical cyclones can destroy mobile homes and structurally damage buildings with foundations winds of this strength due to downslope winds off terrain have been known to shatter windows and sandblast paint from cars.14 tornadoedit a dangerous rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and the base of a cumulonimbus cloud thundercloud or a cumulus cloud in rare cases tornadoes come in many sizes but typically form a visible condensation funnel whose narrowest end reaches the earth and surrounded by a cloud of debris and dust.17 tornadoes despite being one of the most destructive weather phenomena are generally short-lived a long-lived tornado generally lasts no more than an hour but some have been known to last for 2 hours or longer for example the tri-state tornado due to their relatively short duration less information is known about the development and formation of tornadoes.21 downburst and derechoedit downbursts are created within thunderstorms by significantly rain-cooled air which upon reaching ground level spreads out in all directions and produce strong winds unlike winds in a tornado winds in a downburst are not rotational but are directed outwards from the point where they strike land or water squall lineedit a squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along or ahead of a cold front.2930 the squall line typically contains heavy precipitation hail frequent lightning strong straight line winds and possibly tornadoes or waterspouts.31 severe weather in the form of strong straight-line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line forms a bow echo in the farthest portion of the bow.32 tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern lewp where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present.33 somewhich? summer bow echoes are called derechos and move quickly over large territories.25 a wake low or a mesoscale low-pressure area forms behind the rain shield a high pressure system under the rain canopy of a mature squall line and is sometimes associated with a heat burst.34 squall lines often cause severe straight-line wind damage and most non-tornadic wind damage is caused from squall lines.35 although the primary danger from squall lines is straight-line winds some squall lines also contain weak tornadoes.35 tropical cycloneedit very high winds can be caused by mature tropical cyclones called hurricanes in the united states and canada and typhoons in eastern asia a tropical cyclone's heavy surf created by such winds may cause harm to marine life either close to or upon the surface of the water such as coral reefs.36 coastal regions may receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone while inland regions are relatively safe from the strong winds due to their rapid dissipation over land however severe flooding can occur even far inland because of high amounts of rain from tropical cyclones and their remnants waterspoutedit waterspouts are generally defined as tornadoes or non-supercell tornadoes that develop over bodies of water.37 waterspouts are not known for inflicting much damage because they are not commonly exposed to land but they are capable of traveling over land some waterspouts are known to produce hurricane-strength winds and are capable of producing equivalent damage vegetation weakly constructed buildings and other infrastructure may be destroyed by waterspouts automobiles may be lifted by advancing waterspouts heavy precipitation may be noted developed from the water raised by the wind currents waterspouts do not generally last long over terrestrial environments as the friction produced easily dissipates the winds strong horizontal winds cause waterspouts to dissipate38 destroying the concentration of the updrafts while not generally as dangerous as classic tornadoes waterspouts can overturn boats and they can cause severe damage to larger ships.9 strong extratropical cyclonesedit severe local windstorms in europe that develop from winds off the north atlantic these windstorms are commonly associated with the destructive extratropical cyclones and their low pressure frontal systems.39 european windstorms occur mainly in the seasons of autumn and winter.40 a synoptic-scale extratropical storm along the east coast of the united states and atlantic canada is called a nor'easter they are so named because their winds come from the northeast especially in the coastal areas of the northeastern united states and atlantic canada more specifically it describes a low-pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the east coast and whose leading winds in the left forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast nor'easters may cause coastal flooding coastal erosion and hurricane-force winds dust stormedit an unusual form of windstorm that is characterized by the existence of large quantities of sand and dust particles carried by the wind.41 dust storms frequently develop during periods of droughts or over arid and semi-arid regions dust storms have numerous hazards and are capable of causing deaths visibility may be reduced dramatically so risks of vehicle and aircraft crashes are possible additionally the particulates may reduce oxygen intake by the lungs42 potentially resulting in suffocation damage can also be inflicted upon the eyes due to abrasion.43 dust storms can many issues for agricultural industries as well soil erosion is one of the most common hazards and decreases arable lands dust and sand particles can cause severe weathering of buildings and rock formations nearby bodies of water may be polluted by settling dust and sand killing aquatic organisms decrease in exposure to sunlight can affect plant growth as well as decrease in infrared radiation may cause decreased temperatures  wildfiresedit hailedit any form of thunderstorm that produces precipitating hailstones is known as a hailstorm.53 hailstorms are generally capable of developing in any geographic area where thunderclouds cumulonimbus are present although they are most frequent in tropical and monsoon regions.54 the updrafts and downdrafts within cumulonimbus clouds cause water molecules to freeze and solidify creating hailstones and other forms of solid precipitation.55 due to their larger density these hailstones become heavy enough to overcome the density of the cloud and fall towards the ground the downdrafts in cumulonimbus clouds can also cause increases in the speed of the falling hailstones the term hailstorm is usually used to describe the existence of significant quantities or size of hailstones heavy rainfall and floodingedit heavy rainfall can lead to a number of hazards most of which are floods or hazards resulting from floods flooding is the inundation of areas that are not normally under water it is typically divided into three classes river flooding which relates to rivers rising outside their normals banks flash flooding which is the process where a landscape often in urban and arid environments is subjected to rapid floods;59 and coastal flooding which can be caused by strong winds from tropical or non-tropical cyclones.60 meteorologically excessive rains occur within a plume of air with high amounts of moisture also known as an atmospheric river which is directed around an upper level cold-core low or a tropical cyclone.61 flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and are usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it flash floods are most common in dense populated urban environments where less plants and bodies of water are presented to absorb and contain the extra water flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure such as bridges and weakly constructed buildings plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water automobiles parked within experiencing areas can also be displaced soil erosion can occur as well exposing risks of landslide phenomena like all forms of flooding phenomenon flash flooding can also spread and produce waterborne and insect-borne diseases cause by microorganisms flash flooding can be caused by extensive rainfall released by tropical cyclones of any strength or the sudden thawing effect of ice dams.6263 monsoonsedit seasonal wind shifts lead to long-lasting wet seasons which produce the bulk of annual precipitation in areas such as southeast asia australia western africa eastern south america mexico and the philippines widespread flooding occurs if rainfall is excessive64 which can lead to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas.65 floods cause rivers to exceed their capacity with nearby buildings becoming submerged.66 flooding may be exacerbated if there are fires during the previous dry season this may cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic and repel water.67 government organizations help their residents deal with wet-season floods though floodplain mapping and information on erosion control mapping is conducted to help determine areas that may be more prone to flooding.68 erosion control instructions are provided through outreach over the telephone or the internet.69 flood waters that occur during monsoon seasons can often host numerous protozoa bacterial and viral microorganisms.70 mosquitoes and flies will lay their eggs within the contaminated bodies of water these disease agents may cause infections of foodborne and waterborne diseases diseases associated with exposure to flood waters include malaria cholera typhoid hepatitis a and the common cold.71 possible trenchfoot infections may also occur when personnel are exposed for extended periods of time within flooded areas.72 tropical cycloneedit although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they are also important factors in the precipitation regimes of areas they affect they bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.74 areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.75 tropical cyclones can also relieve drought conditions.76 they also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism as a result tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the earth's troposphere  severe winter weatheredit heavy snowfalledit lake-effect snow is produced in the winter in the shape of one or more elongated bands this occurs when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores.82 for more information on this effect see the main article conditions within blizzards often include large quantities of blowing snow and strong winds which may significantly reduce visibility reduced viability of personnel on foot may result in extended exposure to the blizzard and increase the chance of becoming lost the strong winds associated with blizzards create wind chill that can result in frostbites and hypothermia the strong winds present in blizzards are capable of damaging plants and may cause power outages frozen pipes and cut off fuel lines.83 strong extratropical cyclonesedit the precipitation pattern of nor'easters is similar to other mature extratropical storms nor'easters can cause heavy rain or snow either within their comma-head precipitation pattern or along their trailing cold or stationary front nor'easters can occur at any time of the year but are mostly known for their presence in the winter season.84 severe european windstorms are often characterized by heavy precipitation as well.40 ice stormedit ice storms are also known as a silver storm referring to the color of the freezing precipitation.85 ice storms are caused by liquid precipitation which freezes upon cold surfaces and leads to the gradual development of a thickening layer of ice.85 the accumulations of ice during the storm can be extremely destructive trees and vegetation can be destroyed and in turn may bring down power lines causing the loss of heat and communication lines.86 roofs of buildings and automobiles may be severely damaged gas pipes can become frozen or even damaged causing gas leaks avalanches may develop due to the extra weight of the ice present visibility can be reduced dramatically the aftermath of an ice storm may result in severe flooding due to sudden thawing with large quantities of displaced water especially near lakes rivers and bodies of water.87 heat and droughtedit droughtedit another form of severe weather is drought which is a prolonged period of persistently dry weather that is absence of precipitation.88 although droughts do not develop or progress as quickly as other forms of severe weather89 their effects can be just as deadly in fact droughts are classified and measured based upon these effects.88 droughts have a variety of severe effects they can cause crops to fail89 and they can severely deplete water resources sometimes interfering with human life.88 a drought in the 1930s known as the dust bowl affected 50 million acres of farmland in the central united states.88 in economic terms they can cost many billions of dollars a drought in the united states in 1988 caused over $40 billion in losses90 exceeding the economic totals of hurricane andrew the great flood of 1993 and the 1989 loma prieta earthquake.89 in addition to the other severe effects the dry conditions caused by droughts also significantly increase the risk of wildfires.88 heat wavesedit although official definitions vary a heat wave is generally defined as a prolonged period with excessive heat.91 although heat waves do not cause as much economic damage as other types of severe weather they are extremely dangerous to humans and animals according to the united states national weather service the average total number of heat-related fatalities each year is higher than the combined total fatalities for floods tornadoes lightning strikes and hurricanes.92 in australia heat waves cause more fatalities than any other type of severe weather.91 as in droughts plants can also be severely affected by heat waves which are often accompanied by dry conditions can cause plants to lose their moisture and die.93 heat waves are often more severe when combined with high humidity.92 see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

mississippi the state has a population of approximately 3 million it is the 32nd most extensive and the 32nd most populous of the 50 united states located in the center of the state jackson is the state capital and largest city with a population of approximately 175000 people the state is heavily forested outside of the mississippi delta area between the mississippi and yazoo rivers before the american civil war most development in the state was along riverfronts where slaves worked on cotton plantations after the war the bottomlands to the interior were cleared mostly by freedmen by the end of the 19th century african americans made up two-thirds of the delta's property owners but timber and railroad companies acquired much of the land after a financial crisis clearing altered the delta's ecology increasing the severity of flooding along the mississippi much land is now held by agribusinesses a largely rural state with agricultural areas dominated by industrial farms mississippi is ranked low or last among the states in such measures as health educational attainment and median household income.678 the state's catfish aquaculture farms produce the majority of farm-raised catfish consumed in the united states.9 since the 1930s and the great migration mississippi has been majority white albeit with the highest percentage of black residents of any u.s state from the early 19th century to the 1930s its residents were mostly black a population that before the american civil war was composed largely of african american slaves democratic party whites retained political power through jim crow laws in the first half of the 20th century nearly 400000 rural blacks left the state for work and opportunities in northern and midwestern cities with another wave of migration around world war ii to west coast cities in 2010 37 of mississippians were african americans the highest percentage of african americans in any u.s state since gaining enforcement of their voting franchise in the late 1960s most african americans support democratic candidates in local state and national elections conservative whites have shifted to the republican party african americans are a majority in many counties of the mississippi-yazoo delta an area of historic settlement during the plantation era since 2011 mississippi has been ranked as the most religious state in the country.10  contents  etymologyedit the state's name is derived from the mississippi river which flows along its western boundary settlers named it after the ojibwe word misi-ziibi great river geographyedit mississippi is bordered to the north by tennessee to the east by alabama to the south by louisiana and a narrow coast on the gulf of mexico and to the west across the mississippi river by louisiana and arkansas in addition to its namesake major rivers in mississippi include the big black river the pearl river the yazoo river the pascagoula river and the tombigbee river major lakes include ross barnett reservoir arkabutla lake sardis lake and grenada lake with the largest lake being sardis lake most of mississippi is part of the east gulf coastal plain the coastal plain is generally composed of low hills such as the pine hills in the south and the north central hills the pontotoc ridge and the fall line hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations yellow-brown loess soil is found in the western parts of the state the northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the alabama black belt the coastline includes large bays at bay st louis biloxi and pascagoula it is separated from the gulf of mexico proper by the shallow mississippi sound which is partially sheltered by petit bois island horn island east and west ship islands deer island round island and cat island the northwest remainder of the state consists of the mississippi delta a section of the mississippi alluvial plain the plain is narrow in the south and widens north of vicksburg the region has rich soil partly made up of silt which had been regularly deposited by the flood waters of the mississippi river areas under the management of the national park service

from the gulf of mexico especially in the southern part of the state hurricane camille in 1969 and hurricane katrina in 2005 which killed 238 people in the state were the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state both caused nearly total storm surge destruction of structures in and around gulfport biloxi and pascagoula as in the rest of the deep south thunderstorms are common in mississippi especially in the southern part of the state on average mississippi has around 27 tornadoes annually the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year two of the five deadliest tornadoes in u.s history have occurred in the state these storms struck natchez in southwest mississippi see the great natchez tornado and tupelo in the northeast corner of the state about seven f5 tornadoes have been recorded in the state   ecologyedit mississippi is heavily forested with over half of the state's area covered by wild trees including mostly pine as well as cottonwood elm hickory oak pecan sweetgum and tupelo ecological problemsedit floodingedit due to seasonal flooding possible from december to june the mississippi and yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the mississippi delta the river's flooding created natural levees which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops temporary workers built levees along the mississippi river on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded from 1858 to 1861 the state took over levee building accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor in those years planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work contractors hired gangs of irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land many of the irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established.15 before the american civil war the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height although in some areas they reached twenty feet flooding has been an integral part of mississippi history but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth the banks of the river were denuded becoming unstable and changing the character of the river after the civil war major floods swept down the valley in 1865 1867 1874 and 1882 such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by confederate and union fighting during the war as well as those constructed after the war.16 in 1877 the state created the mississippi levee district for southern counties in 1879 the united states congress created the mississippi river commission whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees both white and black transient workers were hired to build the levees in the late 19th century by 1882 levees averaged seven feet in height but many in the southern delta were severely tested by the flood that year.16 after the 1882 flood the levee system was expanded in 1884 the yazoo-mississippi delta levee district was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern delta counties also included were some counties in arkansas which were part of the delta.17 even as scientific knowledge about the mississippi river has grown upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover strengthening the river's current the state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology historyedit near 10000 bc native americans or paleo-indians arrived in what today is referred to as the american south.20 paleoindians in the south were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that became extinct following the end of the pleistocene age in the mississippi delta native american settlements and agricultural fields were developed on the natural levees higher ground in the proximity of rivers the native americans developed extensive fields near their permanent villages together with other practices they created some localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the mississippi delta as a whole.21 after thousands of years succeeding cultures of the woodland and mississippian culture eras developed rich and complex agricultural societies in which surplus supported the development of specialized trades both were mound builder cultures those of the mississippian culture were the largest and most complex constructed beginning about 950ce the peoples had a trading network spanning the continent from the great lakes to the gulf coast their large earthworks which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts still stand throughout the mississippi and ohio river valleys descendant native american tribes of the mississippian culture in the southeast include the chickasaw and choctaw other tribes who inhabited the territory of mississippi and whose names were honored by colonists in local towns include the natchez the yazoo and the biloxi the first major european expedition into the territory that became mississippi was that of the spanish explorer hernando de soto who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540 in his second expedition to the new world colonial eraedit in april 1699 french colonists established the first european settlement at fort maurepas also known as old biloxi built in the vicinity of present-day ocean springs on the gulf coast it was settled by pierre le moyne d'iberville in 1716 the french founded natchez on the mississippi river as fort rosalie it became the dominant town and trading post of the area the french called the greater territory new france the spanish continued to claim part of the gulf coast area east of mobile bay of present-day southern alabama in addition to the entire area of present-day florida united states territoryedit from 1800 to about 1830 the united states purchased some lands treaty of doak's stand from native american tribes for new settlements of european americans they were mostly migrants from other southern states particularly virginia and north carolina where soils were exhausted.22 on september 27 1830 the treaty of dancing rabbit creek was signed between the u.s government and the choctaw the choctaw agreed to sell their traditional homelands in mississippi and alabama for compensation and removal to reservations in indian territory now oklahoma this opened up land for sale to european-american immigrant settlement article 14 in the treaty allowed those choctaw who chose to remain in the state to become u.s citizens the second major non-european ethnic group to do so the cherokee were the first.2324 today approximately 9500 choctaw live in neshoba newton leake and jones counties federally recognized tribes include the mississippi band of choctaw indians many slaveholders brought slaves with them or purchased them through the domestic slave trade especially in new orleans through the trade nearly one million slaves were transported to the deep south including mississippi in a forced internal migration that broke up many slave families of the upper south where planters were selling excess slaves the southerners imposed slave laws and restricted the rights of free blacks according to their view of white supremacy  beginning in 1822 slaves in mississippi were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishment by their owners.25 southern slave codes made the willful killing of a slave illegal in most cases.26 for example the 1860 mississippi case of oliver v state charged the defendant with murdering his own slave.27 on december 10 1817 mississippi was the 20th state admitted to the union david holmes was elected the first governor of the state.28 plantations were developed primarily along the major rivers where the waterfront provided access to the major transportation routes this is also where early towns developed linked by the steamboats that carried commercial products and crops to markets the backcountry remained largely undeveloped frontier until it was cleared by freedmen during reconstruction and later.29 by 1860 the enslaved african-american population numbered 436631 or 55 of the state's total of 791305 there were fewer than 1000 free people of color.30 the relatively low population of the state before the civil war reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the riverfronts which formed the main transportation corridors ninety percent of the delta bottomlands were frontier and undeveloped.29 the state needed many more settlers for development civil war to 20th centuryedit on january 9 1861 mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the union and it was one of the founding members of the confederate states the first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves during the war union and confederate forces struggled for dominance on the mississippi river critical to supply routes and commerce more than 80000 mississippians fought in the civil war and casualties were extremely heavy union general ulysses s grant's long siege of vicksburg finally gained the union control of the river in 1863 in the postwar period freedmen withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations the majority of blacks left the southern baptist church sharply reducing its membership they created independent black baptist congregations by 1895 they had established numerous black baptist state associations and the national baptist convention of black churches.31 in addition independent black denominations such as the african methodist episcopal church established in philadelphia pennsylvania and the african methodist episcopal zion church established in new york city sent missionaries to the south in the postwar years they quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the south southern congregations brought their own influences to those denominations as well.3132 during reconstruction the first mississippi constitutional convention in 1868 with delegates both black and white framed a constitution whose major elements would be maintained for 22 years.33 the convention was the first political organization in the state to include african-american representatives 17 among the 100 members 32 counties had black majorities at the time some among the black delegates were freedmen but others were educated free blacks who had migrated from the north the convention adopted universal suffrage did away with property qualifications for suffrage or for office a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites provided for the state's first public school system forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel.33 under the terms of reconstruction mississippi was restored to the union on february 23 1870 because the mississippi delta contained so much fertile bottomland that had not been developed before the civil war 90 percent of the land was still frontier after the civil war tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land in addition black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and raising timber and eventually advance to ownership the new farmers included many freedmen who achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the mississippi bottomlands by the late 19th century in the 1870s and 1880s many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.29 around the start of the 20th century two-thirds of the mississippi farmers who owned land in the delta were african american.29 many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the civil war as another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s however numerous african-american farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labor.29 democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1875 after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the white line campaign based on asserting white supremacy democratic whites became well armed and formed paramilitary organizations such as the red shirts to suppress black voting from 1874 to the elections of 1875 they pressured whites to join the democrats and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known riots in cities around the state to intimidate blacks and suppress their voting they killed a total of 150 blacks although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many a total of three white republicans and five white democrats were reported killed in rural areas deaths of blacks could be covered up riots better described as massacres of blacks took place in vicksburg clinton macon and in their counties as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and lynched known black leaders destroying local political organizations.34 seeing the success of this deliberate mississippi plan south carolina and other states followed it and also achieved white dominance in 1877 the last of federal troops were withdrawn from the region even in this environment black mississippians continued to be elected into local office however black residents were deprived of all political power after white legislators passed a new state constitution in 1890 specifically to eliminate the nigger from politics according to the state's democratic governor james k vardaman.35 it erected barriers to voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively disenfranchised most black mississippians and many poor whites estimates are that 100000 black and 50000 white men were removed from voter registration rolls in the state over the next few years.36 the loss of political influence contributed to the difficulties of african americans in their attempts to obtain extended credit in the late 19th century together with imposition of jim crow and racial segregation laws whites committed an increased rate of lynchings of blacks mostly men beginning in the 1890s and extending to 1930 cotton crops failed due to boll weevil infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913 creating crisis conditions for many african americans with control of the ballot box and more access to credit white planters bought out such farmers expanding their ownership of delta bottomlands they also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state.29 20th century to presentedit blacks also faced violence in the form of lynching shooting and the burning of churches in 1923 the national association for the advancement of colored people stated the negro feels that life is not safe in mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white man.37 in the early 20th century some industries were established in mississippi but jobs were generally restricted to whites including child workers the lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as chicago and detroit seeking employment where they also competed with european immigrants the state depended on agriculture but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work by 1900 many white ministers especially in the towns subscribed to the social gospel movement which attempted to apply christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day many strongly supported prohibition believing it would help alleviate and prevent many sins.38 african-american baptist churches grew to include more than twice the number of members as their white baptist counterparts the african-american call for social equality resonated throughout the great depression in the 1930s and world war ii in the 1940s the second great migration from the south started in the 1940s lasting until 1970 almost half a million people left mississippi in the second migration three-quarters of them black nationwide during the first half of the 20th century african americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs the second great migration included destinations in the west especially california where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to both african americans and whites blacks and whites in mississippi generated rich quintessentially american music traditions gospel music country music jazz blues and rock and roll all were invented promulgated or heavily developed by mississippi musicians many of them african american and most came from the mississippi delta many musicians carried their music north to chicago where they made it the heart of that city's jazz and blues so many african americans left in the great migration that after the 1930s they became a minority in mississippi in 1960 they made up 42 of the state's population.39 the whites maintained their discriminatory voter registration processes established in 1890 preventing most blacks from voting even if they were well educated court challenges were not successful until later in the century after world war ii african-american veterans returned with renewed commitment to be treated as full citizens of the united states and increasingly organized to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights the civil rights movement had many roots in religion and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism mississippi was a center of activity based in black churches to educate and register black voters and to work for integration in 1954 the state had created the mississippi state sovereignty commission a tax-supported agency chaired by the governor that claimed to work for the state's image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local white citizens councils to suppress black activism white citizens councils had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 united states supreme court ruling brown v board of education that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional they used intimidation and economic blackmail against activists and suspected activists including teachers and other professionals techniques included loss of jobs and eviction from rental housing in the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in mississippi and establish freedom schools the mississippi freedom democratic party was established to challenge the all-white democratic party of the solid south most white politicians resisted such changes chapters of the ku klux klan and its sympathizers used violence against activists most notably the murders of chaney goodman and schwerner in 1964 during the freedom summer campaign this was a catalyst for congressional passage the following year of the voting rights act of 1965 mississippi earned a reputation in the 1960s as a reactionary state.4041 after decades of disenfranchisement african americans in the state gradually began to exercise their right to vote again for the first time since the 19th century following the passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965 which ended de jure segregation and enforced constitutional voting rights registration of african-american voters increased and black candidates ran in the 1967 elections for state and local offices the mississippi freedom democratic party fielded some candidates teacher robert g clark of holmes county was the first african american to be elected to the state house since reconstruction he continued as the only african american in the state legislature until 1976 and was repeatedly elected into the 21st century including three terms as speaker of the house.42 in 1966 the state was the last to repeal officially statewide prohibition of alcohol before that mississippi had taxed the illegal alcohol brought in by bootleggers governor paul johnson urged repeal and the sheriff raided the annual junior league mardi gras ball at the jackson country club breaking open the liquor cabinet and carting off the champagne before a startled crowd of nobility and high-ranking state officials.43 on august 17 1969 category 5 hurricane camille hit the mississippi coast killing 248 people and causing us$1.5 billion in damage 1969 dollars in 1987 20 years after the u.s supreme court had ruled in 1967's loving v virginia that a similar virginian law was unconstitutional mississippi repealed its ban on interracial marriage also known as miscegenation which had been enacted in 1890 it also repealed the segregationist-era poll tax in 1989 in 1995 the state symbolically ratified the thirteenth amendment which had abolished slavery in 1865 though ratified in 1995 the state never officially notified the u.s archivist which kept the ratification unofficial until 2013 when ken sullivan contacted the office of secretary of state of mississippi delbert hosemann who agreed to file the paperwork and make it official.444546 in 2009 the legislature passed a bill to repeal other discriminatory civil rights laws which had been enacted in 1964 the same year as the federal civil rights act but ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by federal courts republican governor haley barbour signed the bill into law.47 the end of legal segregation and jim crow led to the integration of some churches but most today remain divided along racial and cultural lines having developed different traditions after the civil war most african americans left white churches to establish their own independent congregations particularly baptist churches establishing state associations and a national association by the end of the century they wanted to express their own traditions of worship and practice.48 in more diverse communities such as hattiesburg some churches have multiracial congregations.49 demographicsedit the center of population of mississippi is located in leake county in the town of lena.52 the united states census bureau estimates that the population of mississippi was 2992333 on july 1 2015 a 0.84 increase since the 2010 united states census.51 the state's economist characterized the state as losing population as job markets elsewhere have caused 3.2 per 1000 to migrate recently.53 from 2000 to 2010 the united states census bureau reported that mississippi had the highest rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race up 70 percent in the decade it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population.49 in addition mississippi led the nation for most of the last decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population the total population has not increased significantly but is young some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births but it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity a binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of racial segregation in the civil rights era people of african descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights as the demographer william frey noted in mississippi i think it's identifying as mixed race changed from within.49 historically in mississippi after indian removal in the 1830s the major groups were designated as black african american who were then mostly enslaved and white primarily european american matthew snipp also a demographer commented on the increase in the 21st century in the number of people identifying as being of more than one race in a sense they're rendering a more accurate portrait of their racial heritage that in the past would have been suppressed.49 after having comprised a majority of the state's population since well before the civil war and through the 1930s today african americans comprise approximately 37 percent of the state's population most have ancestors who were enslaved with many forcibly transported from the upper south in the 19th century to work on the area's new plantations some of these slaves were mixed race with european ancestors as there were many children born into slavery with white fathers some also have native american ancestry.54 during the first half of the 20th century a total of nearly 400000 african americans left the state during the great migration for opportunities in the north midwest and west they became a minority in the state for the first time since early in its development the state has had conservative laws related to sexuality the state's sodomy law criminalized consensual sex between adults of the same gender until 2003 but was seldom enforced when such laws were voided by the supreme court case lawrence v texas in 2004 voters in mississippi approved amendment 1 amending the state's constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage the measure passed with 86 of the vote the highest margin of victory in the nation this law was overturned by obergefell v hodges 2015 the decision of the u.s supreme court making same-sex marriage a constitutional right.55 despite conservative laws same-sex couples were forming families in the state according to the 2010 census approximately 33 of households led by same-sex couples in mississippi included at least one child the highest such percentage in the nation.56 ancestryedit at the 2010 u.s census the racial makeup of the population was ethnically 2.7 of the total population among all racial groups was of hispanic or latino origin they may be of any race.57 as of 2011 53.8 of mississippi's population younger than age 1 were minorities meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-hispanic white.58 for more information on racial and ethnic classifications in the united states see race and ethnicity in the united states census americans of scots-irish english and scottish ancestry are present throughout the state it is believed that there are more people with such ancestry than identify as such on the census in part because their immigrant ancestors are more distant in their family histories english scottish and scots-irish are generally the most under-reported ancestry groups in both the south atlantic states and the east south central states the historian david hackett fischer estimated that a minimum 20 of mississippi's population is of english ancestry though the figure is probably much higher and another large percentage is of scottish ancestry many mississippians of such ancestry identify simply as american on questionnaires because their families have been in north america for centuries.6263 in the 1980 census 656371 mississippians of a total of 1946775 identified as being of english ancestry making them 38 of the state at the time.64 the state in 2010 had the highest proportion of african americans in the nation the african-american percentage of population has begun to increase due mainly to a younger population than the whites the total fertility rates of the two races are approximately equal due to patterns of settlement and whites putting their children in private schools in almost all of mississippi's public school districts a majority of students are african american african americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern yazoo delta and the southwestern and the central parts of the state these are areas where historically african americans owned land as farmers in the 19th century following the civil war or worked on cotton plantations and farms.65 people of french creole ancestry form the largest demographic group in hancock county on the gulf coast the african-american choctaw mostly in neshoba county and chinese-american portions of the population are also almost entirely native born chinese came to mississippi as indentured laborers from cuba during the 1870s with others coming from mainland china in the later 19th century the majority entering the state immigrated directly from china to mississippi between 1910 and 1930 when they were recruited by planters as laborers while most first worked as sharecroppers the chinese worked as families to improve their lives many became small merchants and especially grocers in small towns throughout the delta.66 in these roles the ethnic chinese carved out a niche in the state between black and white where they were concentrated in the delta these small towns have declined since the late 20th century and many ethnic chinese have joined the exodus to larger cities including jackson their population in the state overall has increased in the 21st century.676869 in the early 1980s many vietnamese immigrated to mississippi and other states along the gulf of mexico where they became employed in fishing-related work.70 languageedit religionedit under french and spanish rule beginning in the 17th century european colonists were mostly roman catholics the growth of the cotton culture after 1815 brought in tens of thousands of anglo-american settlers each year most of whom were protestants from southeastern states due to such migration there was rapid growth in the number of protestant churches especially methodist presbyterian and baptist.73 the revivals of the great awakening in the late 18th and early 19th centuries initially attracted the plain folk by reaching out to all members of society including women and blacks both slaves and free blacks were welcomed into methodist and baptist churches independent black baptist churches were established before 1800 in virginia kentucky south carolina and georgia and later developed in mississippi as well in the post-civil war years religion became more influential as the south became known as the bible belt public opinion polls have consistently ranked mississippi as the most religious state in the united states with 59 of mississippians considering themselves very religious the same survey also found that 11 of the population were non-religious.76 in a 2009 gallup poll 63 of mississippians said that they attended church weekly or almost weekly  the highest percentage of all states u.s average was 42% and the lowest percentage was in vermont at 23%.77 another 2008 gallup poll found that 85 of mississippians considered religion an important part of their daily lives the highest figure among all states u.s average 65%.78 birth dataedit note births in table don't add up because hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race giving a higher overall number lgbtedit the 2010 united states census counted 6286 same-sex unmarried-partner households in mississippi an increase of 1512 since the 2000 united states census.83 33 contained at least one child giving mississippi the distinction of leading the nation in the percentage of same-sex couples raising children.84 mississippi has the largest percentage of african-american same-sex couples among total households the state capital jackson ranks tenth in the nation in concentration of african-american same-sex couples the state ranks fifth in the nation in the percentage of hispanic same-sex couples among all hispanic households and ninth in the highest concentration of same-sex couples who are seniors.85 with the passing of hb 1523 in april 2016 from july it became legal in mississippi to refuse service to same-sex couples based on one's religious beliefs.8687 the bill has become the subject of controversy.88 healthedit the state is ranked 50th or last place among all the states for health care according to the commonwealth fund a nonprofit foundation working to advance performance of the health care system.89 mississippi has the highest rate of infant and neonatal deaths of any u.s state age-adjusted data also shows mississippi has the highest overall death rate and the highest death rate from heart disease hypertension and hypertensive renal disease influenza and pneumonia.90 in 2011 mississippi and arkansas had the least number of dentists in the united states.91 for three years in a row more than 30 percent of mississippi's residents have been classified as obese in a 2006 study 22.8 percent of the state's children were classified as such mississippi had the highest rate of obesity of any u.s state from 2005 to 2008 and also ranks first in the nation for high blood pressure diabetes and adult inactivity.9293 in a 2008 study of african-american women contributing risk factors were shown to be lack of knowledge about body mass index bmi dietary behavior physical inactivity and lack of social support defined as motivation and encouragement by friends.94 a 2002 report on african-american adolescents noted a 1999 survey which suggests that a third of children were obese with higher ratios for those in the delta.95 the study stressed that obesity starts in early childhood extending into the adolescent years and then possibly into adulthood. it noted impediments to needed behavioral modification including the delta likely being the most underserved region in the state with african americans the major ethnic group lack of accessibility and availability of medical care and an estimated 60 of residents living below the poverty level.95 additional risk factors were that most schools had no physical education curriculum and nutrition education is not emphasized previous intervention strategies may have been largely ineffective due to not being culturally sensitive or practical.95 a 2006 survey found nearly 95 percent of mississippi adults considered childhood obesity to be a serious problem.96 economyedit the bureau of economic analysis estimates that mississippi's total state product in 2010 was $98 billion.97 gdp growth was .5 percent in 2015 and is estimated to be 2.4 in 2016 according to dr darrin webb the state's chief economist who noted it would make two consecutive years of positive growth since the recession.98 per capita personal income in 2006 was $26908 the lowest per capita personal income of any state but the state also has the nation's lowest living costs 2015 data records the adjusted per capita personal income at $40105.98 mississippians consistently rank as one of the highest per capita in charitable contributions.99 at 56 percent the state has one of the lowest workforce participation rates in the country approximately 70000 adults are disabled which is 10 percent of the workforce.98 mississippi's rank as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton agriculture before and after the civil war late development of its frontier bottomlands in the mississippi delta repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century that required massive capital investment in levees and ditching and draining the bottomlands and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities.100 in addition when democrats regained control of the state legislature they passed the 1890 constitution that discouraged corporate industrial development in favor of rural agriculture a legacy that would slow the state's progress for years.101 before the civil war mississippi was the fifth-wealthiest state in the nation its wealth generated by the labor of slaves in cotton plantations along the rivers.102 slaves were counted as property and the rise in the cotton markets since the 1840s had increased their value by 1860 a majority  55 percent  of the population of mississippi was enslaved.103 ninety percent of the delta bottomlands were undeveloped and the state had low overall density of population largely due to the domination of the plantation economy focused on the production of agricultural cotton the state's elite was reluctant to invest in infrastructure such as roads and railroads they educated their children privately industrialization did not reach many areas until the late 20th century the planter aristocracy the elite of antebellum mississippi kept the tax structure low for their own benefit making only private improvements before the war the most successful planters such as confederate president jefferson davis owned riverside properties along the mississippi and yazoo rivers in the mississippi delta away from the riverfronts most of the delta was undeveloped frontier during the civil war 30000 mississippi soldiers mostly white died from wounds and disease and many more were left crippled and wounded changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the south caused severe losses in wealth in 1860 assessed valuation of property in mississippi had been more than $500 million of which $218 million 43 percent was estimated as the value of slaves by 1870 total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177 million.104 poor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression the constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens the committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes.105 it took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles the upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war by 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state but the crop of 565000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.106 blacks cleared land selling timber and developing bottomland to achieve ownership in 1900 two-thirds of farm owners in mississippi were blacks a major achievement for them and their families due to the poor economy low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties two decades later the majority of african americans were sharecroppers the low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of african americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.29 entertainment and tourismedit the legislature's 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the mississippi river and the gulf coast has led to increased revenues and economic gains for the state gambling towns in mississippi have attracted increased tourism they include the gulf coast resort towns of bay st louis gulfport and biloxi and the mississippi river towns of tunica the third largest gaming area in the united states greenville vicksburg and natchez in 2012 mississippi had the sixth largest gambling revenue of any state with $2.25 billion.108 the federally recognized mississippi band of choctaw indians has established a gaming casino on its reservation which yields revenue to support education and economic development.citation needed manufacturingedit mississippi like the rest of its southern neighbors is a right-to-work state it has some major automotive factories such as the toyota

tightened and stricter employment criteria are imposed mississippi ranks as having the second-highest ratio of spending to tax receipts of any state in 2005 mississippi citizens received approximately $2.02 per dollar of taxes in the way of federal spending this ranks the state 2nd highest nationally and represents an increase from 1995 when mississippi received $1.54 per dollar of taxes in federal spending and was 3rd highest nationally.116 this figure is based on federal spending after large portions of the state were devastated by hurricane katrina requiring large amounts of federal aid from the federal emergency management agency fema however from 1981 to 2005 it was at least number four in the nation for federal spending vs taxes received.117 a proportion of federal spending in

u.s supreme court in torcaso v watkins 1961 political alignmentedit mississippi led the south in developing a disfranchising constitution passing it in 1890 by raising barriers to voter registration the state legislature disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites excluding them from politics until the late 1960s it established a one-party state dominated by white democrats in the mid-20th century mississippi white voters together with other southern white voters shifted their allegiance to the republican party first for national and then for state offices but may still vote for democrats at the local level mississippi was the last state to have presidential elections in which one candidate gained a popular vote exceeding 90 and 85% in 1944 and 1964 respectively in both years the voting reflected essentially only white voters in the state as most african americans were overwhelmingly still disenfranchised under the state's 1890 constitution and discriminatory practices in 1944 democrat franklin d roosevelt won nearly 94 of mississippi's popular vote in 1964 republican barry m goldwater carried the state with 87 of votes reflecting the shift among conservative white voters to supporting republican candidates most blacks were still disenfranchised as they were until after passage of the voting rights act of 1965 and concerted grassroots efforts to achieve

had a small number of schools and no educational institutions for african americans the first school for black students was not established until 1862 during reconstruction in 1871 black and white republicans drafted a constitution that was the first to provide for a system of free public education in the state the state's dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools in the early 20th century there were still few schools in rural areas particularly for black children with seed money from the julius rosenwald fund many rural black communities across mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children essentially many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities in many cases donating land and/or labor to build such schools.125 blacks and whites attended segregated and separate public schools in mississippi until the late 1960s although such segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the united states supreme court in its 1954 ruling in brown v board of education in the majority-black mississippi delta counties white parents worked through white citizens councils to set up private segregation academies where they enrolled their children often funding declined for the public schools.126 but in the state as a whole only a small minority of white children were withdrawn from public schools state officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new businesses after several years of integration whites often dominated local systems anyway maintaining white supremacy many black parents complained that they had little representation in school administration and that many of their former administrators and teachers had been pushed out they have had to work to have their interests and children represented.126 in the late 1980s the state had 954 public elementary and secondary schools with a total yearly enrollment of about 369500 elementary pupils and about 132500 secondary students some 45700 students attended

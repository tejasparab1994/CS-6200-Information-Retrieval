current pronunciation which is extremely unusual in english speaking countries is almost certainly a result of a printing error in some copies of the city charter of march 18 1816 though not on the original document the error was repeated commonly enough throughout the rest of the 19th century that the original pronunciation was lost and in 1890 the h was removed in order to make it easier to spell after a public campaign the original spelling was officially restored by the united states board on geographic names in 1911.21 the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee

monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to u.s steel's clairton coke works the nation's largest coke mill and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution

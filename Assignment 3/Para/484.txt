thermal low thermal lows or heat lows are non-frontal low-pressure areas that occur over the continents in the subtropics during the warm season as the result of intense heating when compared to their surrounding environments.1 thermal lows occur near the sonoran desert on the mexican plateau in california's great central valley the sahara over north-west argentina in south america over the kimberley region of north-west australia the iberian peninsula and the tibetan plateau  contents  formationedit role in the monsoon regimeedit monsoons are caused by the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle of land temperature compared to that of nearby oceans this differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a mixed layer that may be fifty meters deep through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated turbulence whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so additionally the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land together these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean the hot air over the land tends to rise creating an area of low pressure this creates a steady wind blowing toward the land bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it.15 similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains16 surface heating17 convergence at the surface18 divergence aloft or from storm-produced outflows at the surface.19 however the lifting occurs the air cools due expansion in lower pressure which in turn produces condensation in winter the land cools off quickly but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat the hot air over the ocean rises creating a low pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land increased by wintertime cooling.15 monsoons are similar to sea and land breezes a term usually referring to the localized diurnal daily cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere but they are much larger in scale stronger and seasonal.20 role in sea breeze formationedit along the california coast the cooler water sets up a surface marine layer that is much cooler than inland areas during the summer at the same time the intense heating inland creates a pronounced thermal trough aligned with the great central valley and typically linked to the broader thermal low across the north american deserts as a consequence a strong pressure gradient is created which draws cool marine air landward as temperatures plummet fog and stratus stream in and through the gaps of the coast ranges and especially through the golden gate at san francisco see san francisco fog the same thermal trough is sometimes pushed toward the coast especially in late fall as higher pressure develops to the east due to cooling further east this setup often brings the warmest temperatures of the year to the normally cool coastline as the seabreeze stops or is even replaced by a dangerously dry land breeze role in air pollutionedit in areas where it is hilly or mountainous near the coastline thermally-forced sea breezes combined with wind circulations up the sides of the mountains can encourage the production of chemicals which can lead to the development of smog pollution has been tracked into the mid-levels of the troposphere in the form of ozone which is concentrated over the circulation of the thermal low as well as adjacent oceanic areas.23 referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

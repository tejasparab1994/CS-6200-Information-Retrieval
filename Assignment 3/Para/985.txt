micro-g environment  contents  absence of gravityedit compare the gravitational potential at some of these locations free falledit what remains is a micro-g environment moving in free fall i.e there are no forces other than gravity acting on the people or objects in this environment to prevent air drag making the free fall less perfect objects and people can free-fall in a capsule that itself while not necessarily in free fall is accelerated as in free fall.citation needed this can be done by applying a force to compensate for air drag alternatively free fall can be carried out in space or in a vacuum tower or shaft the two cases that can be distinguished are that where the situation is only temporary because after some time the earth's surface is or would be reached and the case where the situation can go on indefinitely a temporary micro-g environment exists in a drop tube in a tower or shaft a sub-orbital spaceflight e.g with a sounding rocket and in an airplane such as used by nasa's reduced gravity research program aka the vomit comet and by the zero gravity corporation a temporary micro-g environment is applied for training of astronauts for some experiments for filming movies and for recreational purposes a micro-g environment for an indefinite time while also possible in a spaceship going to infinity in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit is most practical in an earth orbit this is the environment commonly experienced in the international space station space shuttle etc while this scenario is the most suitable for scientific experimentation and commercial exploitation it is still quite expensive to operate in mostly due to launch costs tidal and inertial accelerationedit objects in orbit are not perfectly weightless due to several effects commercial applicationsedit metal spheresedit in a shot tower now obsolete molten metal such as lead or steel was dripped through a sieve into free fall with sufficient height several hundred feet the metal would be solid enough to resist impact usually in a water bath at the bottom of the tower while the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage through the air and by impact at the bottom this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in shotgun shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy high-quality crystalsedit while not yet a commercial application there has been interest in growing crystals in micro-g as in a space station or automated artificial satellite in an attempt to reduce crystal lattice defects.4 such defect-free crystals may prove useful for certain microelectronic applications and also to produce crystals for subsequent x-ray crystallography comparison of boiling of water under earth's gravity 1 g left and microgravity right the source of heat is in the lower part of the photograph a comparison between the combustion of a candle on earth left and in a microgravity environment such as that found on the iss right protein crystals grown by american scientists on the russian space station mir in 1995.5 comparison of insulin crystals growth in outer space left and on earth right see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

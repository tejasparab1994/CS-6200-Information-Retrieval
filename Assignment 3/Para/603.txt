by jay brazeau he runs garkos enterprises and is known for using the name medusa as a pseudonym for some of his companies and breaking medusa-head staffs during moments of anger stavros garkos is the most persistent of the villains from hurricanes in most of his appearances he tries to steal the hurricanes status as world's greatest football team and/or make large sums of money garkos interests also include damaging the hurricanes image even when he doesn't seem to gain anything from this and his attempts in 'proving football as a greek sport stavros garkos holds many companies around the

satellite garkos enterprises has an office in london even though it was unclear which kind of activities he develops there wyn smithe and genghis khan wyn and genghis are stavros garkos best players and are the ones most often enlisted to assist stavros with his schemes it is rare to see the gorgons playing without them both except through injury and even rarer to see one of them appearing in an episode without the other one instance of this occurring is in when hurricanes collide when genghis appeared but wyn did not.citation needed even though stavros favours them they have little loyalty in return they once attempted to steal a gold mine so as to be able to stop working for stavros.citation needed rebo rebo's biggest role in stavros garkos's dirty schemes was in blood match when rebo stole dino allegro's lucky charm damaging his abilities as the hurricanes's main goalkeeper he also makes a cameo helping wyn and genghis to keep the hurricanes from playing a fund-raiser game to save inverfinnan park home to jock stone's former team inverfinnan celtics a spoof of celtic fc of scotland from being bought by garkos most of rebo's other appearances is simply playing football benny the viking this unpopular swede is hated by his fellow patriots for his dirty play stavros garkos tries to revert it by hiring a publicist who puts benny to compete against cal casey on a game show where casey not only defeats benny but also teaches him the value of good sportsmanship a lesson that he only practices at his home country this enhancing his popularity for a price stavros garkos didn't like to pay lobo lobo was once nominated for the title of spain's best football player his rival for the title was toro from the hurricanes to help his player to get the title stavros garkos kidnaps toro's sister maria as part of a plan to ruin his popularity the garkos familyedit stavros garkos sometimes enlists the help of some relatives for some dirty tactics here we have some of them spiro garkos stavros's brother spiro is nowhere to be seen without a uniform and on his very first appearance he's called by amanda a mister-in-charge-of-everything what could be noticed from his first appearance in stowaway when he was revealed to be the coach of the gorgons youth team the police chief of the island of garkos and the head of child welfare in around the world in 90 minutes spiro is the admiral of the garkon navy and helped his brother to take over the aircraft carrier the hurricanes were using to play football at sea he also makes a cameo appearance in there's only one jock stone as captain of stavros garkos's cruise ship melinda garkos stavros's sister melinda helps her brother in anything he wants to no matter how low she has to get her low acts include making people ruined by stavros garkos sell their homes to him water water everywhere stealing artifacts from ancient egyptian pyramids serpents of the nile passing herself as the legendary medusa the curse of the gorgon and helping the gorgons to forge evidence to blackmail referees on dino's snapshoot irena bole stavros's niece stavros garkos had a scheme involving a childhood friend of cal casey this friend had criminal records and is now a goalkeeper for the l.a lasers irena only agreed to help her uncle in exchange of becoming the first female vice-president of garkos enterprises when the plan fails garkos says he wouldn't hire her even as a coffee-lady since she's single she's called ms. and doesn't bear the name garkos we can assume spiro and melinda aren't stavros garkos's only siblings stavros garkos iv stavros's namesake and look-alike great-grandson from the future stavros garkos had mortgaged all his companies to bet against the hurricanes and lost because of that all stavros iv inherited was his football team to revert this situation stavros iv sends a robot player named the relegator to change the game results stavros garkos was reluctant about this because he couldn't have a great-grandson for not even having grandchildren as he stated but he started believing when the bet something he never expected to meet someone who already knew about was mentioned for a final test garkos asks the relegator what he thinks about rules and he says they must be broken this making stavros believe he's been sent by a garkos the robot fails and the plan b destroys a factory forcing garkos to pay for the damages creating an alternate future where stavros iv washes the hurricanes's uniforms since this was a dream of napper thompson it doesn't affect the continuity of the series dream or not this is so far the strongest clue pointing stavros garkos as a father of at least one child garkos enterprisesedit stavros garkos holds many companies around the world even though it was

hotel where the gorgons go to sleep when they are in hispanola it was never said if the hotel belongs to garkos or not but the name medusa and its connections to the gorgons make us assume it does

company helped stavros garkos to take over walker laboratories when its former owner mickey walker had missed the deadline to pay the mortgage medusa network objecting to have a television network

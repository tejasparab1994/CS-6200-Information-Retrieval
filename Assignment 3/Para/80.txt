jet stream jet streams are fast flowing narrow meandering air currents in the atmospheres of some planets including earth.1 on earth the main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds flowing west to east their paths typically have a meandering shape jet streams may start stop split into two or more parts combine into one stream or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet jet streams are the product of two factors the atmospheric heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale polar ferrel and hadley circulation cells and the action of the coriolis force acting on those moving masses the coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis on other planets internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams the polar jet stream forms near the interface of the polar and ferrel circulation cells while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the ferrel and hadley circulation cells.2 other jet streams also exist during the northern hemisphere summer easterly jets can form in tropical regions typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes low-level jets also are typical of various regions such as the central united states meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting the main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines often the airlines work to fly 'with the jet stream for this reason dynamic north atlantic tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users clear-air turbulence a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety is often found in a jet stream's vicinity but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times these are a narrow belt  contents  discoveryedit descriptionedit the width of a jet stream is typically a few hundred kilometres or miles and its vertical thickness often less than five kilometres 3.1 miles.17 the jet stream moves from west to east bringing changes of weather.22 meteorologists now understand that the path of jet streams affects cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere and so knowledge of their course has become an important part of weather forecasting for example in 2007 and 2012 britain experienced severe flooding as a result of the polar jet staying south for the summer.232425 the polar and subtropical jets merge at some locations and times while at other times they are well separated causeedit in general winds are strongest immediately under the tropopause except locally during tornadoes tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations if two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference which ultimately causes wind is highest within the transition zone the wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area but is deflected by the coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.26 all these facts are consequences of the thermal wind relation the balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force the balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic beyond the tropics the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction and the primary struggle is between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient force balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance one can derive the thermal wind relation the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient if two air masses one cold and dense to the north and the other hot and less dense to the south are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass the coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the east while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west the general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction as a result winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude therefore the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the equator is warmer than the north and south poles.26 polar jet streamedit the thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized into tight jets rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere one factor that contributes to the creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front this causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude at high altitudes lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole this results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic' the polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.18 subtropical jetedit a second factor which contributes to a concentrated jet that is more applicable to the subtropical jet which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude tropical air rises to the tropopause and moves poleward before sinking this is the hadley cell circulation as it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum since friction with the ground is significant air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the coriolis force true for either hemisphere which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds27 note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere other planetsedit jupiter's atmosphere has multiple jet streams caused by the convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure on jupiter these convection cells are driven by internal heating.21 the factors that control the number of jet streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology in models as one increases the planetary radius holding all other parameters fixed the number of jet streams decreases some effectsedit hurricane protectionedit the subtropical jet stream rounding the base of the mid-oceanic upper trough is thoughtcitation needed to be one of the reasons most of the hawaiian islands have been resistant to the long list of hawaii hurricanes that have approached for example when hurricane flossie 2007 approached and dissipated just before reaching landfall the u.s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa cited vertical wind shear as evidenced in the photo.28 usesedit on earth the northern polar jet stream is the most important one for aviation and weather forecasting as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the northern hemisphere while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of south america the term jet stream in these contexts thus usually implies the northern polar jet stream aviationedit associated with jet streams is a phenomenon known as clear-air turbulence cat caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams.31 the cat is strongest on the cold air side of the jet32 next to and just under the axis of the jet.33 clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents such as the death of one passenger on united airlines flight 826.3435 possible future power generationedit unpowered aerial attackedit near the end of world war ii the japanese fire balloon was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the pacific ocean to reach the west coast of canada and the united states they were relatively ineffective as weapons but they were used in one of the few attacks on north america during world war ii causing six deaths and a small amount of damage.39 changes due to climate cyclesedit effects of ensoedit dust bowledit evidence suggests the jet stream was at least partly responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s dust bowl in the midwest united states normally the jet stream flows east over the gulf of mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the great plains during the dust bowl the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal this starved the great plains and other areas of the midwest of rainfall causing extraordinary drought conditions.52 longer-term climatic changesedit climate scientists have hypothesized that the jet stream will gradually weaken as a result of global warming trends such as arctic sea ice decline reduced snow cover evapotranspiration patterns and other weather anomalies are expected to make the arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe this in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.53545556575859 other upper-level jetsedit polar night jetedit low level jetsedit there are wind maxima at lower levels of the atmosphere that are also referred to as jets barrier jetedit a barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains the mountain barrier increases the strength of the low level wind by 45 percent.64 in the north american great plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours.65 a similar phenomenon develops across australia which pulls moisture poleward from the coral sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.66 valley exit jetedit they are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit diurnal mountain wind systems such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the us deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.67 africaedit see alsoedit

bay of bengal  contents  extentedit the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the bay of bengal as follows:3 etymologyedit riversedit the irrawaddy or ayeyarwady river in myanmar flows into the andaman sea of the bay of bengal and once had thick mangrove forests of its own seaportsedit indian ports on the bay include kolkata port haldia port chennai visakhapatnam kakinada pondicherry dhamra gopalpur and bangladeshi ports on the bay are chittagong mongla payra port islandsedit the islands in the bay are numerous including the andaman islands nicobar and mergui groups of india the cheduba group of islands in the north-east off the burmese coast are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes which are occasionally active great andaman is the main archipelago or island group of the andaman islands whereas ritchie's archipelago consists of smaller islands only 37 or 6.5% of the 572 islands and islets of the andaman and nicobar islands are inhabited.8 beachesedit oceanographyedit plate tectonicsedit the lithosphere of the earth is broken up into what are called tectonic plates underneath the bay of bengal which is part of the great indo-australian plate and is slowly moving north east this plate meets the burma microplate at the sunda trench the nicobar islands and the andaman islands are part of the burma microplate the india plate subducts beneath the burma plate at the sunda trench or java trench here the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the volcanoes in myanmar and a volcanic arc called the sunda arc the sumatra-andaman earthquake and asian tsunami was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a submarine earthquake which then resulted in a destructive tsunami.11 marine geologyedit a zone 50 m wide extending from the island of ceylon and the coromandel coast to the head of the bay and thence southwards through a strip embracing the andaman and nicobar islands is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom some 50 m beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit opposite the mouth of the ganges however the intervals between these depths are very much extended by deltaic influence marine biology flora and faunaedit the bay of bengal is full of biological diversity diverging amongst coral reefs estuaries fish spawning and nursery areas and mangroves the bay of bengal is one of the world's 64 largest marine ecosystems kerilia jerdonii is a sea snake of the bay of bengal glory of bengal cone conus bengalensis is just one of the seashells which can be photographed along beaches of the bay of bengal.15 an endangered species the olive ridley sea turtle can survive because of the nesting grounds made available at the gahirmatha marine wildlife sanctuary gahirmatha beach odisha india marlin barracuda skipjack tuna katsuwonus pelamis yellowfin tuna indo-pacific humpbacked dolphin sousa chinensis and bryde's whale balaenoptera edeni are a few of the marine animals bay of bengal hogfish bodianus neilli is a type of wrass which live in turbid lagoon reefs or shallow coastal reefs schools of dolphins can be seen whether they are the bottle nose dolphin tursiops truncatus pantropical spotted dolphin stenella attenuata or the spinner dolphin stenella longirostris tuna and dolphins usually reside in the same waters in shallower and warmer coastal waters the irrawaddy dolphins orcaella brevirostris can be found.1617 the great nicobar biosphere reserve provides sanctuary to many animals some of which include the saltwater crocodile crocodylus porosus giant leatherback sea turtle dermochelys coriacea and malayan box turtle cuora amboinensis kamaroma to name a few another endangered species royal bengal tiger is supported by sundarbans a large estuarine delta that holds a mangrove area in the ganges river delta.1819 chemical oceanographyedit physical oceanography  climateedit from january to october the current is northward flowing and the clockwise circulation pattern is called the east indian current the bay of bengal monsoon moves in a northwest direction striking the nicobar islands and the andaman islands first end of may then the north eastern coast of india by end of june the remainder of the year the counterclockwise current is southwestward flowing and the circulation pattern is called the east indian winter jet september and december see very active weather season varsha or monsoon in the bay of bengal producing severe cyclones which affect eastern india several efforts have been initiated to cope with storm surge.21 tropical storms and cyclonesedit a tropical storm with rotating winds blowing at speeds of 74 miles 119 kilometres per hour is called a cyclone when they originate over the bay of bengal and called a hurricane in the atlantic.22 between 100000 and 500000 residents of bangladesh were killed because of the 1970 bhola cyclone historic sitesedit religious importanceedit the bay of bengal in the stretch of swargadwar the gateway to heaven in sanskrit in the indian town of puri is considered holy by hindus the samudra arati is a daily tradition started by the present shankaracharya of puri 9 years ago to honour the sacred sea.26 the daily practise includes prayer and fire offering to the sea at swargadwar in puri by disciples of the govardhana matha of the shankaracharya on paush purnima of every year the shankaracharya himself comes out to offer prayers to the sea economyedit one of the first trading ventures along the bay of bengal was the company of merchants of london trading into the east indies more commonly referred to as the british east india company gopalpur-on-sea was one of their main trading centers other trading companies along the bay of bengal shorelines were the english east india company and the french east india company.27 bimstec bay of bengal initiative for multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation bimstec supports free trade internationally around the bay of bengal between bangladesh bhutan india myanmar nepal sri lanka and thailand the sethusamudram shipping canal project is a new venture proposed which would create a channel for a shipping route to link the gulf of mannar with the bay of bengal this would connect india from east to west without the necessity of going around sri lanka strategic importanceedit the bay of bengal is centrally located in south and southeast asia it lies at the center of two huge economic blocks the saarc and asean it influences china's southern landlocked region in the north and major sea ports of india and bangladesh china india and bangladesh have forged naval cooperation agreements with malaysia thailand and indonesia to increase cooperation in checking terrorism in the high seas.31 its outlying islands the andaman and nicobar islands and most importantly major ports such as kolkata chennai visakhapatnam tuticorin chittagong and mongla along its coast with the bay of bengal added to its importance.32 china has recently made efforts to project influence into the region through tie-ups with myanmar and bangladesh.33 the united states has held major exercises with bangladesh malaysia singapore thailand and recently india34353637 the largest ever wargame in bay of bengal known as malabar 2007 was held in 2007 and naval warships from us bangladesh thailand singapore japan and australia took part india was a participant large deposits of natural gas in the areas within bangladesh's sea zone incited a serious urgency by india and myanmar into a territorial dispute.31 disputes over rights of some oil and gas blocks have caused brief diplomatic spats between myanmar and india with bangladesh the disputed maritime boundary between bangladesh and myanmar resulted in military tensions in 2008 and 2009 bangladesh is pursuing a settlement with myanmar and india to the boundary dispute through the international tribunal on the law of the sea.38 environmental hazardsedit pollutionedit the asian brown cloud a layer of air pollution that covers much of south asia and the indian ocean every year between january and march and possibly also during earlier and later months hangs over the bay of bengal it is considered to be a combination of vehicle exhaust smoke from cooking fires and industrial discharges.39 transboundary issues affecting the marine ecosystemedit a transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem and/or its impact is separated by a national boundary or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit the eight bay of bengal countries have 2012 identified three major transboundary problems or areas of concern affecting the health of the bay that they can work on together with the support of the bay of bengal large marine ecosystem project boblme the eight countries are now 2012 developing responses to these issues and their causes for future implementation as the strategic action programme overexploitation of fisheriesedit the main causes of the issues are open access to fishing grounds government emphasis on increasing fish catches inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers increasing fishing effort especially from trawlers and purse seiners high consumer demand for fish including for seed and fishmeal for aquaculture ineffective fisheries management and illegal and destructive fishing degradation of critical habitatsedit the bay of bengal is an area of high biodiversity with many endangered and vulnerable species the major transboundary issues relating to habitats are the loss and degradation of mangrove habitats degradation of coral reefs and the loss of and damage to seagrasses the transboundary nature of these major issues are that all three critical habitats occur in all boblme countries coastal development for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all boblme countries trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature climate change impacts are shared by all boblme countries the main causes of the issues are food security needs of the coastal poor lack of coastal development plans increasing trade in products from coastal habitats coastal development and industrialization ineffective marine protected areas and lack of enforcement upstream development that affects water-flow intensive upstream agricultural practices and increasing tourism pollution and water qualityedit the major transboundary issues relating to pollution and water quality are sewage-borne pathogens and organic load solid waste/marine litter increasing nutrient inputs oil pollution persistent organic pollutants pops and persistent toxic substances ptss sedimentation and heavy metals the transboundary nature of these issues are discharge of untreated/partially treated sewage being a common problem sewage and organic discharges from the ganges-brahmaputra-meghna river are likely to be transboundary plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries high nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries tar balls are transported long distances pops/ptss and mercury including organo-mercury undergo long-range transport sedimentation and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension the main causes of the issues are increasing coastal population density and urbanization higher consumption resulting in more waste generated per person insufficient funds allocated to waste management migration of industry into boblme countries and proliferation of small industries historyedit british penal colonyedit marine archaeologyedit maritime archaeology or marine archaeology is the study of material remains of ancient peoples a specialized branch archaeology of shipwrecks studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships stone anchors amphorae shards elephant tusks hippopotamus teeth ceramic pottery a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive the test of time for archaeologists to study and place the salvaged findings into a time line of history coral reefs tsunamis cyclones mangrove swamps battles and a criss cross of sea routes in a high trading area combined with pirating have all contributed to shipwrecks in the bay of bengal.43 famous ships and shipwrecksedit see alsoedit

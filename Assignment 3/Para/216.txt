monsoon trough the monsoon trough is a portion of the intertropical convergence zone12 as depicted by a line on a weather map showing the locations of minimum sea level pressure1 and as such is a convergence zone between the wind patterns of the southern and northern hemispheres westerly monsoon winds lie in its equatorward portion while easterly trade winds exist poleward of the trough.3 right along its axis heavy rains can be found which usher in the peak of a location's respective rainy season as it passes poleward of a location hot and dry conditions develop the monsoon trough plays a role in creating many of the world's rainforests the term monsoon trough is most commonly used in monsoonal regions of the western pacific such as asia and australia the migration of the itcz/monsoon trough into a landmass heralds the beginning of the annual rainy season during summer months depressions and tropical cyclones often form in the vicinity of the monsoon trough with each capable of producing a year's worth of rainfall in a matter of days  contents  movement and strengthedit monsoon troughing in the western pacific reaches its zenith in latitude during the late summer when the wintertime surface ridge in the opposite hemisphere is the strongest it can reach as far as the 40th parallel in east asia during august and the 20th parallel in australia during february its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure over the warmest part of the various continents.456 in the southern hemisphere the monsoon trough associated with the australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in february7 oriented along a west-northwest/east-southeast axis effect of wind surgesedit increases in the relative vorticity or spin with the monsoon trough are normally a product of increased wind convergence within the convergence zone of the monsoon trough wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence a strengthening or equatorward movement in the subtropical ridge can cause a strengthening of a monsoon trough as a wind surge moves towards the location of the monsoon trough as fronts move through the subtropics and tropics of one hemisphere during their winter normally as shear lines when their temperature gradient becomes minimal wind surges can cross the equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon trough in the other hemisphere's summer.8 a key way of detecting whether a wind surge has reached a monsoon trough is the formation of a burst of thunderstorms within the monsoon trough.9 embedded depressionsedit if a circulation forms within the monsoon trough it is able to compete with the neighboring thermal low over the continent and a wind surge will occur at its periphery such a circulation which is broad in nature within a monsoon trough is known as a monsoon depression in the northern hemisphere monsoon depressions are generally asymmetric and tend to have their strongest winds on their eastern periphery.9 light and variable winds cover a large area near their center while bands of showers and thunderstorms develop within their area of circulation.10 rolesedit in rainy seasonedit since the monsoon trough is an area of convergence in the wind pattern and an elongated area of low pressure at the surface the trough focuses low level moisture and is defined by one or more elongated bands of thunderstorms when viewing satellite imagery its abrupt movement to the north between may and june is coincident with the beginning of the monsoon regime and rainy seasons across south and east asia this convergence zone has been linked to prolonged heavy rain events in the yangtze river as well as northern china.2 its presence has also been linked to the peak of the rainy season in locations within australia.15 as it progresses poleward of a particular location clear hot and dry conditions develop as winds become westerly.16 many of the world's rainforests are associated with these climatological low pressure systems.17 in tropical cyclogenesisedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

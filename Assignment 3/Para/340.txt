cyclone tracy  contents  meteorological historyedit preparationsedit darwin had been severely battered by cyclones before in january 1897 and again in march 1937.15 however in the 20 years leading up to cyclone tracy the city had undergone a period of rapid expansion e.p milliken estimated that on the eve of the cyclone there were 43500 people living in 12000 dwellings in the darwin area though building standards required that some attention be given to the possibility of cyclones most buildings were not capable of withstanding the force of a cyclone's direct hit on the day of the cyclone most residents of darwin believed that the cyclone would not cause any damage to the city cyclone selma had been predicted to hit darwin earlier in the month but it instead went north and dissipated without affecting darwin in any way as a result cyclone tracy took most darwin residents by surprise despite several warnings the people of darwin did not evacuate or prepare for the cyclone many residents continued to prepare for christmas and many attended christmas parties despite the increasing winds and heavy rain journalist bill bunbury interviewed the residents of darwin some time later and recorded the experiences of the survivors of the cyclone in his book cyclone tracy picking up the pieces.16 resident dawn lawrie a 1971 independent candidate for the electorate of nightcliff told him another resident barbara langkrens said impactedit several factors delayed the dissemination of the news of the cyclone's impact the destruction of transportation infrastructure and the distance between darwin and the rest of the australian population played a role as did the fact the storm made landfall on christmas day and most media outlets had only a skeleton crew rostered on at best most australians were not aware of the cyclone until late in the afternoon dick muddimer a reporter for the local abc station 5dr was able to travel through the wreckage to local television station ntd and had the abc station in mount isa queensland notify abc headquarters in sydney that darwin had been hit by a cyclone.19 in order to provide the initial emergency response a committee was created the committee composed of several high-level public servants and police stated that darwin had for the time being ceased to exist as a city gough whitlam the australian prime minister was touring syracuse sicily at the time and flew to darwin upon hearing of the disaster additionally the australian government began a mass evacuation by road and air all of the defence force personnel throughout australia along with the entire royal australian air force's fleet of transport planes were recalled from holiday leave and deployed to evacuate civilians from darwin as well as to bring essential relief supplies to the area thirteen ships of the royal australian navy were used to transport supplies to the area as part of operation navy help darwin the largest humanitarian or disaster relief operation ever performed by the navy.20 health and essential services crisisedit as soon as the worst of the storm had passed darwin faced several immediate health crises on christmas day the darwin hospital treated well over five hundred patients with 112 of these being admitted into the hospital and both of the facility's operating theatres being utilised the first casualties did not arrive till 7 a.m because of high winds and severe road conditions in and around the darwin area operating continued throughout the night and into the early morning local teams worked without relief until the arrival of a surgical team from canberra late that day those who were considered unable to return to work within two weeks were evacuated by air to safer locations those who remained in darwin faced the threat of several diseases due to much of the city being without water electricity or basic sanitation an initial response was to vaccinate residents for typhoid and cholera approximately 30000 people were homeless and were forced to seek shelter in several makeshift housing and emergency centres that lacked proper hygienic conditions volunteers came in from across the country to assist with the emergency relief efforts trench latrines were dug water supplies delivered by tankers and mass immunisation programs begun the army was given the task of searching houses for bodies of people and animals as well as locating other health risks for example cleaning out rotting contents from fridges and freezers across the city this was completed within a week houses which had been 'searched and cleared had s&c painted on an external wall the city itself was sprayed with malathion to control mosquitoes and other similar pests attempts to reconnect the essential services to the city began on christmas day local officers from the commonwealth department of housing and construction began clearing debris and working to restore power they sealed off damaged water hydrants and activated pumps to reactivate the city's water and sewerage systems evacuation and the public responseedit major-general alan stretton director-general of the natural disasters organisation11 and the commonwealth minister for the northern territory rex patterson arrived at darwin airport late on christmas day and took charge of the relief efforts after an assessment of the situation and meetings with the department of the northern territory and the relevant minister it was concluded that darwin's population needed to be reduced to a safe level of 10500 people this decision was made on the advice of dr charles gurd the director of health in the northern territory around 10000 people left darwin and the surrounding area within the first two days but the rate of departures then began to slow down the government then gave support to his position offering full reimbursement of personal costs as long as the evacuation took place the population was evacuated by air and ground because of communications difficulties with darwin airport landing was limited to one plane every ninety minutes at major airports teams of federal and territory department officials as well as salvation army and red cross workers met refugees with the red cross taking responsibility for keeping track of the names and temporary addresses of the refugees evacuations were prioritised according to need women children and the elderly and sick were evacuated first there were reports of men dressing up as women to escape with the early evacuations between 26 and 31 december a total of 35362 people were evacuated from darwin.618 of those 25628 were evacuated by air the remainder by road.618 by 31 december only 10638 people mostly men who were required to help clean up the city remained in darwin stretton also regulated access to the city by means of a permit system permits were only issued to those who were involved in either the relief or reconstruction efforts and were used to prevent the early return of those who had been evacuated upon receiving news of the damage several community groups across australia began fundraising and relief efforts to assist the survivors major reception centres were set up in cities such as katherine tennant creek and alice springs several of the small towns along the stuart highway made efforts to assist people who were fleeing by road supplying them with food fuel rest and mechanical aid at adelaide river the small local population provided hot meals to the refugees who stopped there approximately twenty-four hours after the storm hit darwin the population of alice springs had raised over $105000 to assist the victims of tracy.22 in melbourne at the boxing day test cricket match between australia and england members of both teams moved around the boundaries carrying buckets which the crowd threw cash into for the relief funds darwin families were also given priority on public housing waiting lists on 31 december 1974 stretton recommended that full civilian control should resume in darwin and handed over control of the city to its elected officials aftermathedit reconstruction and effects on darwinedit in february 1975 prime minister gough whitlam announced the creation of the darwin reconstruction commission which was given the task of rebuilding the city within five years focusing primarily on building houses.23 the commission was headed by tony powell.24 the damage to the city was so severe that some advocated moving the entire city however the government insisted that it be rebuilt in the same location by may 1975 darwin's population had recovered somewhat with 30000 residing in the city temporary housing caravans hotels and an ocean liner mv patris were used to house people as reconstruction of permanent housing had not yet begun by september that year ella stack became mayor of darwin in may 1975 and was heavily involved in its reconstruction however by the following april and after receiving criticism for the slow speed of reconstruction the commission had built 3000 new homes in the nearly destroyed northern suburbs and completed repairs to those that had survived the storm several new building codes were drawn up trying to achieve the competing goals of the speedy recovery of the area and ensuring that there would be no repeat of the damage that darwin took in 1974 by 1978 much of the city had recovered and was able to house almost the same number of people as it had before the cyclone hit however by the 1980s as many as sixty percent of darwin's 1974 population had left never to return in the years that followed darwin was almost entirely rebuilt and now shows almost no resemblance to the pre-tracy darwin of december 1974 although a legislative assembly had been set up earlier in the year the northern territory had only minimal self-government with a federal minister being responsible for the territory from canberra however the cyclone and subsequent responses highlighted several problems with the way the regional government was set up this led malcolm fraser whitlam's successor as prime minister to give self-government to the territory in 1978 many of the government records associated with cyclone tracy became publicly available on 1 january 2005 under the 30 year rule  in popular cultureedit arguably the most famous work that cyclone tracy has inspired is the song santa never made it into darwin composed by bill cate and performed by bill cate and boyd robinson in 1975 to raise money for the relief and reconstruction efforts.2526 subsequently the song became so well known that in 1983 hoodoo gurus released tojo a song comparing the japanese bombing of darwin under the command of hideki tojo during world war ii to the damage done by cyclone tracy the much feared japanese invasion never happened but the cyclone was virtually ignored and ended up destroying the city.27 in 1986 the nine network and pbl created cyclone tracy a period drama mini-series based on the events during the cyclone michael fisher ted roberts and leon saunders wrote the series and it starred chris haywood and tracy mann who played the lead characters of steve and connie.28 the mini-series was released on dvd by umbrella entertainment in december 2005 the dvd is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as newsreel footage of the devastation and a documentary titled on a wind and a prayer.29 see alsoedit referencesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit   navigation menu personal tools namespaces

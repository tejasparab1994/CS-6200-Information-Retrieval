atlantic ocean the atlantic ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about 106460000 square kilometers 41100000 square miles.23 it covers approximately 20 percent of the earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area it separates the old world from the new world scientific explorations of the atlantic include the challenger expedition the german meteor expedition columbia university's lamont-doherty earth observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office.5  contents  etymologyedit the term aethiopian ocean derived from ancient ethiopia was applied to the southern atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.11 extent and dataedit the international hydrographic organization iho defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 195312 but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities institutions and countries see for example the cia world factbook correspondingly the extent and number of oceans and seas varies in the southeast the atlantic merges into the indian ocean the 20 east meridian running south from cape agulhas to antarctica defines its border in the 1953 definition it extends south to antarctica while in later maps it is bounded at the 60 parallel by the southern ocean.12 bathymetryedit mid-atlantic ridgeedit in the 1870s the challenger expedition discovered parts of what is now known as the mid-atlantic ridge or the remainder of the ridge was discovered in the 1920s by the german meteor expedition using echo-sounding equipment.22 the exploration of the mar in the 1950s led to the general acceptance of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics.15 ocean flooredit in 1922 a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred the uss stewart used a navy sonic depth finder to draw a continuous map across the bed of the atlantic this involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straight forward with pulses being sent from the vessel which bounce off the ocean floor then return to the vessel.23 the deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps abyssal plains trenches seamounts basins plateaus canyons and some guyots various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11 of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise in the south atlantic the walvis ridge and rio grande rise form barriers to ocean currents the laurentian abyss is found off the eastern coast of canada water characteristicsedit from october to june the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the labrador sea denmark strait and baltic sea.5 the coriolis effect circulates north atlantic water in a clockwise direction whereas south atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi-diurnal that is two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours in latitudes above 40 north some east-west oscillation known as the north atlantic oscillation occurs.5 salinityedit on average the atlantic is the saltiest major ocean surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand 3.3  3.7% by mass and varies with latitude and season evaporation precipitation river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator because of heavy tropical rainfall in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter maximum salinity values occur at about 25 north and south in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.5 the high surface salinity in the atlantic on which the atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent is maintained by two processes the agulhas leakage/rings which brings salty indian ocean waters into the south atlantic and the atmospheric bridge which evaporates subtropical atlantic waters and exports it to the pacific.24 water massesedit there are five intermediate waters four low-salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high-salinity formed through evaporation arctic intermediate water flows from north to become the source for north atlantic deep water south of the greenland-scotland sill these two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins the wide range of salinities in the north atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources labrador sea norwegian-greenland sea mediterranean and south atlantic intermediate water.26 gyresedit the clockwise warm-water north atlantic gyre occupies the northern atlantic and the counter-clockwise warm-water south atlantic gyre appears in the southern atlantic.5 in the north atlantic surface circulation is dominated by three inter-connected currents the gulf stream which flows north-east from the north american coast at cape hatteras the north atlantic current a branch of the gulf stream which flows northward from the grand banks and the subpolar front an extension of the north atlantic current a wide vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre this system of currents transport warm water into the north atlantic without which temperatures in the north atlantic and europe would plunge dramatically.29 sargasso seaedit climateedit climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.5 the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude the warmest zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.5 the gulf stream and its northern extension towards europe the north atlantic drift is thought to have at least some influence on climate for example the gulf stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern north america keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas the gulf stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the florida peninsula in the higher latitudes the north atlantic drift warms the atmosphere over the oceans keeping the british isles and north-western europe mild and cloudy and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern canada the grand banks of newfoundland area and africa's north-western coast in general winds transport moisture and air over land areas.5 natural hazardsedit icebergs are common from february to august in the davis strait denmark strait and the northwestern atlantic and have been spotted as far south as bermuda and madeira ships are subject to superstructure icing in the extreme north from october to may persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from may to september as can hurricanes north of the equator may to december the united states southeast coast especially the virginia and north carolina coasts has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs the bermuda triangle is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes but coast guard records do not support this belief hurricanes are also a natural hazard in the atlantic but mainly in the northern part of the ocean rarely tropical cyclones form in the southern parts hurricanes usually form annually between june and november plate tectonicsedit central atlanticedit northern atlanticedit south atlanticedit west gondwana south america and africa broke up in the early cretaceous to form the south atlantic the apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the south atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computer-assisted plate tectonic reconstructions in 1965.4344 this magnificent fit however has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northward-propagating break-up.43 intra-continental rifts and deformations have also been introduced to subdivide both continental plates into sub-plates.45 closure of the atlanticedit an embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of gibraltar the gibraltar arc in the western mediterranean is migrating westward into the central atlantic where it joins the converging african and eurasian plates together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern atlantic basin meanwhile the scotia arc and caribbean plate in the western atlantic basin are eastward-propagating subduction systems that might together with the gibraltar system represent the beginning of the closure of the atlantic ocean and the final stage of the atlantic wilson cycle.48 historyedit human originedit old worldedit new worldedit during the lgm the laurentide ice sheet covered most of northern north america while beringia connected siberia to alaska in 1973 late u.s geoscientist paul s martin proposed a blitzkrieg colonization of america by which clovis hunters migrated into north america around 13000 years ago in a single wave through an ice-free corridor in the ice sheet and spread southward explosively briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey.57 others later proposed a three-wave migration over the bering land bridge.58 these hypotheses remained the long-held view regarding the settlement of the americas a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries the oldest archaeological sites in the americas have been found in south america sites in north-east siberia report virtually no human presence there during the lgm and most clovis artefacts have been found in eastern north america along the atlantic coast.59 furthermore colonisation models based on mtdna ydna and atdna data respectively support neither the blitzkrieg nor the three-wave hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will eventually confirm each other.60 a proposed route across the pacific to south america could explain early south american finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path through the canadian arctic and down the north american atlantic coast.61 early settlements across the atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed including the solutrean hypothesis and some of the pre-columbian trans-oceanic contact theories atlantic worldedit christopher columbus discovered the americas in 1492 under spanish flag.64 six years later vasco da gama reached india under portuguese flag by navigating south around the cape of good hope thus proving that the atlantic and indian oceans are connected in 1500 in his voyage to india following vasco da gama pedro alvares cabral reached brazil taken by the currents of the south atlantic gyre following these explorations spain and portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the new world and forced the native american population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found spain and portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other european nations out but conflicting interests nevertheless led to a series of spanish-portuguese wars a peace treaty mediated by the pope divided the conquered territories into spanish and portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away england france and the dutch republic enviously watched the spanish and portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with pirates such as henry mainwaring and alexandre exquemelin they could explore the convoys leaving america because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable.64 trans-atlantic trade also resulted in an increasing urbanization in european countries facing the atlantic urbanization grew from 8 in 1300 10.1 in 1500 to 24.5 in 1850 in other european countries from 10 in 1300 11.4 in 1500 to 17 in 1850 likewise gdp doubled in atlantic countries but rose by only 30 in the rest of europe by end of the 17th century the volume of the trans-atlantic trade had surpassed that of the mediterranean trade.67 economyedit the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves.5 the atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields fish marine mammals seals and whales sand and gravel aggregates placer deposits polymetallic nodules and precious stones.68 gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through currently there is no cost-effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit.69 various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea.5 fisheriesedit the shelves of the atlantic hosts one of the world's richest fishing resources the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the scotian shelf georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the bay of fundy the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks.5 fisheries have however undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the atlantic fisheries in the eastern central and south-west atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value the rest of the atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks the third group continuously increasing trend since 1950 is only found in the indian ocean and western pacific.70 in the north-west atlantic landings have decreased from 4.2 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013 during the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery including greenland halibut yellowtail flounder atlantic halibut haddock spiny dogfish while other stocks shown no such signs including cod witch flounder and redfish stocks of invertebrates in contrast remain at record levels of abundance 31 of stocks are overfished in the north-west atlantic.70 in the western central atlantic catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1.3 million tons in 2013 the most important species in the area gulf menhaden reached a million tons in the mid-1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished round sardinella was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished groupers and snappers are overfished and northern brown shrimp and american cupped oyster are considered fully fished approaching overfished 44 of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels.70 in the south-east atlantic catches have decreased from 3.3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.3 million tons in 2013 horse mackerel and hake are the most important species together representing almost half of the landings off south africa and namibia deep-water hake and shallow-water cape hake have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of southern african pilchard and anchovy have improved to fully fished in 2013.70 environmental issuesedit endangered marine species include the manatee seals sea lions turtles and whales drift net fishing can kill dolphins albatrosses and other seabirds petrels auks hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes.72 municipal pollution comes from the eastern united states southern brazil and eastern argentina oil pollution in the caribbean sea gulf of mexico lake maracaibo mediterranean sea and north sea and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the baltic sea north sea and mediterranean sea north atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature sst at tropical latitudes changes that can be attributed to either the natural atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo or to anthropogenic climate change.73 a 2005 report indicated that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc slowed down by 30 between 1957 and 2004.74 if the amo were responsible for sst variability the amoc would have increased in strength which is apparently not the case furthermore it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity.73 therefore these changes in sst must be caused by human activities.75 on 7 june 2006 florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles the biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.77 marine debris which is also known as marine litter describes human-created waste floating in a body of water oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter see alsoedit referencesedit notesedit

2006 pacific typhoon season the 2006 pacific typhoon season was a near-average season that produced a total of 23 named storms 15 typhoons and six super typhoons the season ran throughout 2006 though most tropical cyclones typically develop between may and october the season's first named storm chanchu developed on may 9 while the season's last named storm trami dissipated on december 20 this season was also much active costly and deadly than the previous season throughout the season many typhoons made landfall at a higher intensity typhoon saomai was the most powerful typhoon to strike china for over 50 years as a category 4 typhoon responsible for over 400 deaths typhoon shanshan struck japan and became the costliest typhoon this season with a total damage of about $2.5 billion the philippines got hit by a total of six typhoons which saw the highest number since 1974 all six typhoons were responsible for over 1000 casualties and several millions of damages typhoon ioke which formed from the central pacific entered the basin and became the strongest central pacific hurricane moreover it was stated that the ratio of intense typhoons was 0.73 which was the highest since 1970.1  contents  seasonal forecastsedit seasonal summaryedit the pacific typhoon season runs throughout 2006 and has no official bounds though most tropical cyclones from this basin generally develops from the months from may through to october despite the season turned out to be active most tropical cyclones developed during the second half of the year with only one typhoon chanchu developing during the month of may some minor systems also developed before may with the first tropical system of the year agaton developing to the east of philippines on january 20 bringing minor damages as it crossed the country few days later.7 on september an unnamed and unclassified tropical storm have been discovered by meteorologist gary padgett and dr karl hoarau later typhoon xangsane affected luzon philippines causing major damages with more than 200 people dead.10 the country saw four storms making landfall with three of them reaching category 4 or 5 super typhoon status typhoon cimaron made landfall over in northern luzon as a category 5 super typhoon with minimal damages.11 by november typhoon chebi made landfall in the same area as cimaron though effects from the typhoon were much smaller than cimaron although by late november typhoon durian made landfall in bicol region combined effects with ash from the mayon volcano had killed over 1500 people and damgaes at least us$530 million durian also crossed the basin and into the north indian ocean basin the first time since 2003 during early december two systems formed typhoon utor crossed visayas with minimal damage and tropical storm trami a very weak system that didn't affect any landmasses became the final tropical cyclone and dissipated on december 20.1 systemsedit tropical depression agatonedit tropical depression 01w basyangedit typhoon chanchu caloyedit tropical storm jelawat domengedit on june 24 the jma started to track a weak tropical depression located to the southeast of samar visayas.1521 after crossing the archipelago as it emerged to the south china sea on june 26 the pagasa named it domeng while the jtwc had started issuing advisories with the designation of 03w.22 moving northwestward 03w had entered in an area of favorable environments and intensified into a tropical storm with the naming of jelawat on june 27 jelawat made landfall over southern china and fully dissipated inland on june 29.1522 typhoon ewiniar esteredit on june 29 a persistent tropical disturbance was classified as a tropical depression by the jtwc while east of palau the depression moved northwestward and was upgraded to tropical storm 04w by the jtwc on june 30 the jma designated the storm tropical storm ewiniar at around the same time the name ewiniar was submitted by the federated states of micronesia and refers to a traditional storm god of chuuk severe tropical storm bilis floritaedit typhoon kaemi glendaedit typhoon prapiroon henryedit typhoon mariaedit typhoon saomai juanedit severe tropical storm bopha indayedit the outer bands of tropical storm bopha produced heavy rains over northern luzon triggering flooding that destroyed 1200 homes and killed seven people.37 two of the fatalities occurred after a home was destroyed by a landslide in kalinga province the landslide damaged 20 other homes a church and a school.38 severe tropical storm wukongedit in post-operational analysis by the jma wukong was upgraded to a severe tropical storm tropical storm sonamu katringedit on august 13 a tropical depression formed south of naha okinawa and was named katring by pagasa and sonamu by jma the name sonamu was submitted by dpr korea and signifies a pine tree sonamu began interacting with nearby tropical storm wukong on august 15 with the outflow from the stronger wukong producing unfavourable shear over the cyclone the jma declared the system a tropical depression and stopped issuing advisories on august 16 the jtwc followed shortly after tropical

september 25 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa named an active low pressure area within its area of responsibility tropical depression milenyo after issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert earlier the joint typhoon warning center issued its first warning on tropical depression 18w on september 26 the japan meteorological agency named this system xangsane the name xangsane was submitted by laos and means elephant later that day the jma upgraded xangsane to a severe tropical storm a bout of rapid intensification followed and all three agencies the jma jtwc and pagasa all upgraded the storm to a typhoon late on september 26 or early september 27 xangsane made landfall on samar island as a severe tropical storm severe tropical storm bebinca nenengedit on october 1 a persistent area of low pressure just east of the philippines developed into tropical depression 19w the jma had already been monitoring the storm it was named neneng by pagasa and later that evening was upgraded to a tropical storm by the philippine authorities the jma and jtwc both designated the storm a tropical storm the next day and it was named bebinca by the jma bebinca is a type of macanese milk pudding tropical storm rumbiaedit on october 3 a tropical depression south of minami torishima in high sea-surface temperatures gained enough convection and was designated tropical storm rumbia by the jma although the jtwc had not even carried it as a tropical depression later that day the jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert and began warnings on tropical depression 20w the next day rumbia slowly began to intensify while moving to the northwest but on october 6 its low-level circulation became fully exposed and the jtwc issued a final warning the jma followed suit soon after the remnants of rumbia later became extremely elongated on october 6 before being absorbed into the large extratropical low of bebinca the name rumbia comes from a type of palm tree known as the sago palm typhoon soulikedit tropical depression ompongedit on october 12 a tropical disturbance that had been meandering in the philippine area of responsibility was designated tropical depression ompong by pagasa the depression slowly moved westward toward the philippines but wind shear from typhoon soulik prevented any intensification the depression degenerated into an area of low pressure early the next day typhoon cimaron paengedit typhoon chebi queenieedit encountering dry air entrainment and increased vertical wind shear in the south china sea chebi began to gradually weaken to a severe tropical storm on november 12 it continued to weaken turning northwards towards hainan and was downgraded to a tropical storm the next day on november 14 the jma issued its last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression the jtwc issued its final warning later that same day as chebi dissipated under the strong shear all told the typhoon caused further casualties as well as damage caused by the earlier typhoon cimaron after passing through luzon it left 1 dead and 10 injured.69 in aurora province it caused floods cutting the province's road system70 as well as zero visibility further isolating it from relief efforts.71 typhoon durian remingedit an area of disturbed weather developed southeast of chuuk on november 24 wind shear near the disturbance soon decreased allowing the depression to organize a little it was designated a tropical depression by japan meteorological agency on november 25 and later that day the joint typhoon warning center started issuing warnings on the system as it moved west-northwest towards yap the depression strengthened because it was in an area of high sea-surface temperatures and there were distinct cloud features of anticyclonic outflow according to the jma it was upgraded to a tropical storm on the afternoon of november 26 and named durian the name durian refers to a fruit durio zibethinus and was submitted to the naming list by thailand pagasa claimed that the storm made landfall on the morning of november 30 over southern catanduanes although the jma and jtwc did not recognize this landfall durian then made another landfall after crossing the lagonoy gulf in northeastern albay after weakening due to interaction with land durian was downgraded back to a typhoon by the jtwc the storm continued to move west making landfalls on the bondoc peninsula in quezon on marinduque and finally on oriental mindoro before exiting to the south china sea typhoon utor seniangedit on december 2 an area of convection was spotted by the joint typhoon warning center southeast of chuuk although convection decreased in the next few hours on december 5 the jtwc once again noted flaring deep convection and late on december 6 a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued on the morning of december 7 both the jtwc and japan meteorological agency-rsmc tokyo reported that a tropical depression had formed soon after the depression entered the area of responsibility of pagasa who named it seniang the depression strengthened throughout the day and the jma upgraded it to tropical storm utor later that day the name utor was submitted by the united states on behalf of the marshall islands and is a marshallese word for squall line.signal no.3 has been raised in the

pagasa and jtwc doing the same the storm made landfall shortly after noon local time the same day after crossing the philippines utor took a track similar to typhoon chebi in november first moving northwest then threatening to take aim at hong kong it restrengthened to an 85-kn typhoon before it slowed as it tracked in a weak steering environment within a weakness in the subtropical ridge it then weakened as wind shear increased and dry air entrainment occurred the jma downgraded it to a severe tropical storm on december 13 and to a tropical storm the same day the next day the jtwc downgraded the storm to a tropical storm and issued its last advisory tropical storm trami tomasedit on december 16 the japan meteorological agency started issuing public bulletins on a tropical

upgraded to a tropical storm by the jma and named trami which is a kind of rose tree this name was submitted by vietnam the storm moved west-northwest rapidly towards the philippines but struggled against wind shear and an approaching cold front entering the pagasa area of responsibility on december 18 as it maintained minimal tropical storm intensity it was named tomas the jtwc issued its final warning later that day having never upgraded the storm to tropical storm strength citing no indication of a significant low-level circulation centre on december 19 the jma downgraded the storm to a tropical depression and issued its last public bulletin as the storm dissipated over water other systemsedit on march 7 the jma had upgraded a low-pressure area to a tropical depression formed by the remnants of 01w to the southeast of mindanao philippines.83 during the next day the system moved overland and made landfall over in davao.84 the system emerged to the sulu sea nearing palawan until it weakened back into a low-pressure are on march 10.85 on march 11 the same system emerged to the south china sea as the jma had re-upgraded it back to a tropical depression.86 although the system had experienced shear and became an exposed system the depression fully dissipated late on march 12.87 a trio of tropical depressions were also monitored by the jma during late october the first developed on october 21 about north of the mariana islands.94 the depression moved stationary until its circulation became exposed due to shear on october 23.95 the other two systems were also monitored very briefly by the jma during october 22.96 one in the south china sea as it moved westwards and fully dissipated six hours later where its remnants made landfall in vietnam during the next day whilst the other persisted over in the philippine sea also bringing rainfall to luzon during october 25 just before the arrival of typhoon cimaron.96 storm namesedit international namesedit philippinesedit during the season pagasa used its own naming scheme for the 19 tropical cyclones that either developed within or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility.99 the names were taken from a list of names that had been last used during 2002 and was scheduled to be used again during 2010.99 many names were used for the first time as pagasa had revised their naming lists during 2003 although the name gloria from 2002 was retired and replaced with glenda as it was the name of the incumbent philippine president at that time.99 after the season pagasa had stated that the names milenyo and reming will be retired as they had caused over php1 billion in damages and over 300 fatalities they were subsequently replaced on the list with mario and ruby both names however were retired after the 2014 season being replaced by maymay and rosita respectively  season effectsedit this table summarizes all the systems that developed within or moved into the north pacific ocean to

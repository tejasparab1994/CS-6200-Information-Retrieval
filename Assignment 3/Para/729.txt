hurricane floyd  contents  meteorological historyedit preparationsedit although floyd's track prediction was above average while out at sea the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years the official forecasts did not predict floyd's northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall.4 nearly all of the east coast from florida city florida to plymouth massachusetts was under a hurricane warning at some point however only a fraction of this area actually received hurricane-force winds the last time such widespread hurricane warnings occurred was during hurricane donna in 1960 although the warnings for that storm were accurate.1 impactedit bahamasedit southeastern united statesedit north carolinaedit north carolina received the brunt of the storm's destruction in all hurricane floyd caused 51 fatalities in north carolina much of them from freshwater flooding as well as billions in damage the neuse river roanoke river waccamaw river and new river exceeded 500-year flood levels although damage was lower in these areas compared to the tar river because of lower population densities because most of the cape fear river basin was west of the peak rainfall areas the city of wilmington was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall however the northeast cape fear river a tributary did exceed 500-year flood levels of the state's eastern rivers only the lumber river escaped catastrophic flooding.17 in contrast to the problems eastern north carolina experienced much of the western portion of the state remained under a severe drought.7 virginiaedit mid-atlanticedit by the time floyd hit the shore it was significantly weaker than it was at sea due to the collapsing of its concentric eyes this had little effect on the inland damage caused by the storm however and floyd produced torrential rains and high winds throughout the mid-atlantic as far north as new york city and long island.1 manville new jersey was hit nearly as hard with record-breaking floods coming from the raritan river and the nearby millstone river which join in manville manville's flooding was also exacerbated by the delaware-raritan canal a section of which runs parallel to the millstone river and for a stretch are only separated by several feet a runner's path princeton university in princeton nj for several days declared municipal tap water unsafe to drink advised students in dorms not to shower and provided bottled drinking water the rochelle park new jersey hub of electronic data systems was inundated by the nearby saddle river disrupting service to as many as 8000 atms across the united states.29 flooding in an adjoining bell atlantic switching facility cut off phone service to one million customers in the area.30 new englandedit canadaedit aftermathedit criticism of femaedit ecological effectsedit runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of north carolina's rivers and sounds in the immediate aftermath of the storm freshwater runoff sediment and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in pamlico sound and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero this raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills as had happened after hurricane fran and hurricane bonnie and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries strangely however the year's shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous one possible explanation is that runoff from hurricane dennis caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters so they were less vulnerable to floyd's ill effects.3 pollution from runoff was also a significant fear numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters particularly in the neuse river overall however the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in hurricane fran likely because floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.17 hog waste water contaminationedit when the hurricane hit north carolina it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 million gallons of manure into the rivers which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality.40 ronnie kennedy duplin county director for environmental health said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm 9 percent or three times the average across eastern north carolina had faecal coliform bacteria normally tests showing any hint of faeces in drinking water an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing pathogens are cause for immediate action.41 retirementedit because of the hurricane's destruction in north carolina and elsewhere in the united states the name floyd was retired by the world meteorological organization in the spring of 2000 and it will never again be used for another future atlantic hurricane the name was replaced with franklin in the 2005

north carolina as of 2000  contents  geographyedit north carolina is bordered by south carolina on the south georgia on the southwest tennessee on the west virginia on the north and the atlantic ocean on the east.10 the united states census bureau places north carolina in the south atlantic division of the southern region.11 north carolina consists of three main geographic regions the atlantic coastal plain occupying the eastern portion of the state the central piedmont region and the mountain region in the west which is part of the appalachian mountains.10 the coastal plain consists of more specifically-defined areas known as the outer banks a string of sandy narrow barrier islands separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets including albemarle sound and pamlico sound the tidewater region the native home of the venus flytrap and the inner coastal plain where longleaf pine trees are native.10 so many ships have been lost off cape hatteras that the area is known as the graveyard of the atlantic;10 more than 1000 ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526 the most famous of these is the queen anne's revenge flagship of the pirate blackbeard which went aground in beaufort inlet in 1718.12 flora and faunaedit climateedit north carolina experiences severe weather in both summer and winter with summer bringing threat of hurricanes tropical storms heavy rain and flooding.20 destructive hurricanes that have hit north carolina include hurricane fran hurricane floyd and hurricane hazel the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state as a category 4 in 1954 hurricane isabel ranks as the most destructive of the 21st century.2122 in april 2011 the worst tornado outbreak in north carolina's history occurred thirty confirmed tornadoes touched down mainly in the eastern piedmont and sandhills killing at least 24 people.2425   historyedit woodland-culture american indians were in the area around 1000 bce starting around 750 ce mississippian-culture indians created larger political units with stronger leadership and more stable longer-term settlements during this time important buildings were constructed as pyramidal flat-topped buildings by 1550 many groups of american indians lived in present-day north carolina including chowanoke roanoke pamlico machapunga coree cape fear indians waxhaw waccamaw and catawba.32 in june 1718 the pirate blackbeard ran his flagship the queen anne's revenge aground at beaufort inlet north carolina in present-day carteret county after the grounding her crew and supplies were transferred to smaller ships in november after appealing to the governor of north carolina who promised safe-haven and a pardon blackbeard was killed in an ambush by troops from virginia.34 in 1996 intersal inc. a private firm discovered the remains of a vessel likely to be the queen anne's revenge which was added to the us national register of historic places.35 north carolina became one of the english thirteen colonies and with the territory of south carolina was originally known as the province of carolina the northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729 originally settled by small farmers sometimes having a few slaves who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture the colony lacked cities or towns pirates menaced the coastal settlements but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century as the economy attracted scots-irish quaker english and german immigrants the colonists generally supported the american revolution as the number of loyalists was smaller than in some other colonies during colonial times edenton served as the state capital beginning in 1722 and new bern was selected as the capital in 1766 construction of tryon palace which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor william tryon began in 1767 and was completed in 1771 in 1788 raleigh was chosen as the site of the new capital as its central location protected it from coastal attacks officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital the city was named after sir walter raleigh sponsor of roanoke the lost colony on roanoke island.36 after 1800 cotton and tobacco became important export crops the eastern half of the state especially the tidewater region developed a slave society based on a plantation system and slave labor many free people of color migrated to the frontier along with their european-american neighbors where the social system was looser by 1810 nearly 3 percent of the free population consisted of free people of color who numbered slightly more than 10000 the western areas were dominated by white families especially scots-irish who operated small subsistence farms in the early national period the state became a center of jeffersonian and jacksonian democracy with a strong whig presence especially in the west after nat turner's slave uprising in 1831 north carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks in 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote on may 20 1861 north carolina was the last of the confederate states to declare secession from the union 13 days after the tennessee legislature voted for secession some 125000 north carolinians served in the military 20000 were killed in battle the most of any state in the confederacy and 21000 died of disease the state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in richmond and the state was the scene of only small battles with the defeat of the confederacy in 1865 the reconstruction era began the united states abolished slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to freedmen a republican party coalition of black freedmen northern carpetbaggers and local scalawags controlled state government for three years the white conservative democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870 in part by ku klux klan violence and terrorism at the polls to suppress black voting republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876 when the red shirts a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the democratic party helped suppress black voting more than 150 black americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876 democrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office but the populists attracted voters displeased with them in 1896 a biracial populist-republican fusionist coalition gained the governor's office the democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose jim crow and racial segregation of public facilities voters of north carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four african-american congressmen through these years of the late 19th century in 1899 the state legislature passed a new constitution with requirements for poll taxes and literacy tests for voter registration which disfranchised most black americans in the state.39 exclusion from voting had wide effects it meant that black americans could not serve on juries or in any local office after a decade of white supremacy many people forgot that north carolina had ever had thriving middle-class black americans.40 black citizens had no political voice in the state until after the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 were passed to enforce their constitutional rights it was not until 1992 that another african american was elected as a us representative from north carolina as in the rest of the former confederacy north carolina had become a one-party state dominated by the democratic party impoverished by the civil war the state continued with an economy based on tobacco cotton and agriculture towns and cities remained few in the east a major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the western counties of the piedmont based on cotton mills established at the fall line railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities the state was the site of the first successful controlled powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight by the wright brothers near kitty hawk on december 17 1903 in the first half of the 20th century many african americans left the state to go north for better opportunities in the great migration their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas north carolina was hard hit by the great depression but the new deal programs of franklin d roosevelt for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers after world war ii the state's economy grew rapidly highlighted by the growth of such cities as charlotte raleigh and durham in the piedmont raleigh durham and chapel hill form the research triangle a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research in the 1990s charlotte became a major regional and national banking center tourism has also been a boon for the north carolina economy as people flock to the outer banks coastal area and the appalachian mountains anchored by asheville by the 1970s spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national democrats conservative whites began to vote for republican national candidates and gradually for more republicans locally the greensboro sit-ins played a crucial role in the civil rights movement to bring full equality to american blacks native americans lost colonies and permanent settlementedit historically documented tribes in the north carolina region include the carolina algonquian-speaking tribes of the coastal areas such as the chowanoke roanoke pamlico machapunga coree and cape fear indians who were the first encountered by the english the iroquoian-speaking meherrin cherokee and tuscarora of the interior and southeastern siouan tribes such as the cheraw waxhaw saponi waccamaw and catawba spanish explorers traveling inland in the 16th century met mississippian culture people at joara a regional chiefdom near present-day morganton records of hernando de soto attested to his meeting with them in 1540 in 1567 captain juan pardo led an expedition to claim the area for the spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in mexico pardo made a winter base at joara which he renamed cuenca his expedition built fort san juan and left a contingent of 30 men there while pardo traveled further and built and garrisoned five other forts he returned by a different route to santa elena on parris island south carolina then a center of spanish florida in the spring of 1568 natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior including the one at fort san juan although the spanish never returned to the interior this effort marked the first european attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the united states a 16th-century journal by pardo's scribe bandera and archaeological findings since 1986 at joara have confirmed the settlement.3341 in 1584 elizabeth i granted a charter to sir walter raleigh for whom the state capital is named for land in present-day north carolina then part of the territory of virginia.42 it was the second american territory which the english attempted to colonize raleigh established two colonies on the coast in the late 1580s but both failed the fate of the lost colony of roanoke island remains one of the most widely debated mysteries of american history virginia dare the first english child to be born in north america was born on roanoke island on august 18 1587 dare county is named for her as early as 1650 settlers from the virginia colony moved into the area of albemarle sound by 1663 king charles ii of england granted a charter to start a new colony on the north american continent it generally established north carolina's borders he named it carolina in honor of his father charles i.43 by 1665 a second charter was issued to attempt to resolve territorial questions in 1710 owing to disputes over governance the carolina colony began to split into north carolina and south carolina the latter became a crown colony in 1729 in the 1700s a series of smallpox epidemics swept the south causing high fatalities among the native americans who had no immunity to the new disease it had become endemic in europe.44 according to the historian russell thornton the 1738 epidemic was said to have killed one-half of the cherokee with other tribes of the area suffering equally.45 colonial period and revolutionary waredit after the spanish in the 16th century the first permanent european settlers of north carolina were english colonists who migrated south from virginia the latter had grown rapidly and land was less available nathaniel batts was documented as one of the first of these virginian migrants he settled south of the chowan river and east of the great dismal swamp in 1655.46 by 1663 this northeastern area of the province of carolina known as the albemarle settlements was undergoing full-scale english settlement.47 during the same period the english monarch charles ii gave the province to the lords proprietors a group of noblemen who had helped restore charles to the throne in 1660 the new province of carolina was named in honor and memory of king charles i latin carolus in 1712 north carolina became a separate colony except for the earl granville holdings it became a royal colony seventeen years later.48 a large revolt happened in the state in 1711 known as cary's rebellion differences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western north carolina or the low country and uplands affected the political economic and social life of the state from the 18th until the 20th century the tidewater in eastern north carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural england and the scottish highlands the upcountry of western north carolina was settled chiefly by scots-irish english and german protestants the so-called cohee arriving during the mid to late 18th century the scots-irish from what is today northern ireland were the largest non-english immigrant group before the revolution english indentured servants were overwhelmingly the largest immigrant group before the revolution.495051505152 during the american revolutionary war the english and highland scots of eastern north carolina tended to remain loyal to the british crown because of longstanding business and personal connections with great britain the english welsh scots-irish and german settlers of western north carolina tended to favor american independence from britain most of the english colonists had arrived as indentured servants hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid some africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status most of the free colored families formed in north carolina before the revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free african or african-american men because the mothers were free their children were born free many had migrated or were descendants of migrants from colonial virginia.53 as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in great britain planters imported more slaves and the state's legal delineations between free and slave status tightened effectively hardening the latter into a racial caste the economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor devoted first to the production of tobacco the road to yorktown and america's independence from great britain led through north carolina as the british army moved north from victories in charleston and camden south carolina the southern division of the continental army and local militia prepared to meet them following general daniel morgan's victory over the british cavalry commander banastre tarleton at the battle of cowpens on january 17 1781 southern commander nathanael greene led british lord charles cornwallis across the heartland of north carolina and away from the latter's base of supply in charleston south carolina this campaign is known as the race to the dan or the race for the river.48 in the battle of cowan's ford cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the catawba river at cowan's ford on february 1 1781 in an attempt to engage general morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal.55 morgan had moved to the northern part of the state to combine with general greene's newly recruited forces generals greene and cornwallis finally met at the battle of guilford courthouse in present-day greensboro on march 15 1781 although the british troops held the field at the end of the battle their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior continental army were crippling following this pyrrhic victory cornwallis chose to move to the virginia coastline to get reinforcements and to allow the royal navy to protect his battered army this decision would result in cornwallis eventual defeat at yorktown virginia later in 1781 the patriots victory there guaranteed american independence antebellum periodedit besides slaves there were a number of free people of color in the state most were descended from free african americans who had migrated along with neighbors from virginia during the 18th century the majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women indentured servants or free and african men indentured slave or free.56 after the revolution quakers and mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the revolution to arrange for manumission of their slaves the number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the revolution.57 on october 25 1836 construction began on the wilmington and raleigh railroad58 to connect the port city of wilmington with the state capital of raleigh in 1849 the north carolina railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to greensboro high point and charlotte during the civil war the wilmington-to-raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the confederate war effort supplies shipped into wilmington would be moved by rail through raleigh to the confederate capital of richmond virginia during the antebellum period north carolina was an overwhelmingly rural state even by southern standards in 1860 only one north carolina town the port city of wilmington had a population of more than 10000 raleigh the state capital had barely more than 5000 residents while slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some southern states according to the 1860 census more than 330000 people or 33 of the population of 992622 were enslaved african americans.59 they lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern tidewater in addition 30463 free people of color lived in the state.59 they were also concentrated in the eastern coastal plain especially at port cities such as wilmington and new bern where a variety of jobs were available free african americans were allowed to vote until 1835 when the state revoked their suffrage in restrictions following the slave rebellion of 1831 led by nat turner southern slave codes criminalized willful killing of a slave in most cases.60 american civil waredit in 1860 north carolina was a slave state in which one-third of the population was enslaved this was a smaller proportion than in many southern states the state did not vote to join the confederacy until president abraham lincoln called on it to invade its sister state south carolina becoming the last or second-to-last state to officially join the confederacy the title of last to join the confederacy has been disputed although tennessee's informal secession on may 7 1861 preceded north carolina's official secession on may 206162 the tennessee legislature did not formally vote to secede until june 8 1861.63 north carolina was the site of few battles but it provided the confederacy with at least 125000 troops which is far more than any other state did approximately 40000 of those troops died more than half of disease the remainder from battlefield wounds and from starvation north carolina also supplied about 15000 union troops.64 elected in 1862 governor zebulon baird vance tried to maintain state autonomy against confederate president jefferson davis in richmond after secession some north carolinians refused to support the confederacy some of the yeoman farmers in the state's mountains and western piedmont region remained neutral during the civil war while some covertly supported the union cause during the conflict approximately 2000 north carolinians from western north carolina enlisted in the union army and fought for the north in the war two additional union army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state which were occupied by union forces in 1862 and 1863 numerous slaves escaped to union lines where they became essentially free confederate troops from all parts of north carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the army of northern virginia the confederacy's most famous army the largest battle fought in north carolina was at bentonville which was a futile attempt by confederate general joseph johnston to slow union general william tecumseh sherman's advance through the carolinas in the spring of 1865.48 in april 1865 after losing the battle of morrisville johnston surrendered to sherman at bennett place in what is today durham north carolina's port city of wilmington was the last confederate port to fall to the union in february 1865 after the union won the nearby second battle of fort fisher its major defense downriver the first confederate soldier to be killed in the civil war was private henry wyatt from north carolina in the battle of big bethel in june 1861 at the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 the 26th north carolina regiment participated in pickett/pettigrew's charge and advanced the farthest into the northern lines of any confederate regiment during the battle of chickamauga the 58th north carolina regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on snodgrass hill to push back the remaining union forces from the battlefield at appomattox court house in virginia in april 1865 the 75th north carolina regiment a cavalry unit fired the last shots of the confederate army of northern virginia in the civil war for many years north carolinians proudly boasted that they had been first at bethel farthest at gettysburg and chickamauga and last at appomattox. demographicsedit the united states census bureau estimates that the population of north carolina was 10146788 on july 1 2016 a 6.4 increase since the 2010 united states census.4 of the

have historically been overwhelmingly protestant first anglican then baptist and methodist by the late 19th century the largest protestant denomination was the baptist after the civil war black baptists were not allowed in white churches due to segregation and set up their own independent congregations black baptists went on to develop their own state and national associations to be free of

prosperous economy with steady job growth low unemployment and rising wages93 many of the state's rural counties have suffered from job loss rising levels of poverty and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined.93 according to one estimate one-half of north carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010 primarily due to the poor economy in many of north carolina's

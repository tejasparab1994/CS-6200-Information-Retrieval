catastrophe modeling catastrophe modeling also known as cat modeling is the process of using computer-assisted calculations to estimate the losses that could be sustained due to a catastrophic event such as a hurricane or earthquake cat modeling is especially applicable to analyzing risks in the insurance industry and is at the confluence of actuarial science engineering meteorology and seismology  contents  perils analyzededit natural catastrophes sometimes referred to as nat cat include human catastrophes include lines of business modelededit inputedit the input into a typical cat modeling software package is information on the exposures being analyzed that are vulnerable to catastrophe risk the exposure data can be categorized into three basic groups outputedit the output is an estimate of the losses that the model predicts would be associated with a particular event or set of events when running a probabilistic model the output is either a probabilistic loss distribution or a set of events that could be used to create a loss distribution probable maximum losses pmls and average annual losses aals are calculated from the loss distribution when running a deterministic model losses caused by a specific event are calculated for example hurricane katrina or a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in downtown san francisco could be analyzed against the portfolio of exposures usesedit open catastrophe modelingedit recently an effort to create and disseminate open multi-hazard cat risk modeling tools was initiated by the alliance for global open risk analysis agora also oasis loss modelling framework lmf http://www.oasislmf.org has been created it has been founded as a not for profit organisation funded and owned by the insurance industry to promote open access to models and to promote transparency open source code to be available operating on the oasis lmf modex the cat risk modelling platform has been brought to market by simplitium to provide the reinsurance industry with a deeper understanding of risk the modex platform allows model providers from all over the world to make their models available to the industry using the oasis framework by creating a marketplace where model developers can make their models available via a single user interface the platform lowers the barriers to entry in the cat model marketplace and encourages the development of new and improved cat risk models additionally the insurance industry is currently working with the association for cooperative operations research and development acord to develop an industry standard for collecting and sharing exposure data to date the industry has been operating on closed proprietary data formats see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit  navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

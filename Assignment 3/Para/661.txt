climateedit historyedit 17th centuryedit both the dutch and the english claimed both sides of the delaware river as part of their colonial lands in america.202122 the dutch were the first to take possession.22 by june 3 1631 the dutch had begun settling the delmarva peninsula by establishing the zwaanendael colony on the site of present-day lewes delaware.23 in 1638 sweden established the new sweden colony in the region of fort christina on the site of present-day wilmington delaware new sweden claimed and for the most part controlled the lower delaware river region parts of present-day delaware new jersey and pennsylvania but settled few colonists there.2425 on march 12 1664 king charles ii of england gave james duke of york a grant that incorporated all lands included in the original virginia company of plymouth grant plus other lands this grant was in conflict with the dutch claim for new netherland which included parts of today's pennsylvania.26 on june 24 1664 the duke of york sold the portion of his large grant that included present-day new jersey to john berkeley and george carteret for a proprietary colony the land was not yet in british possession but the sale boxed in the portion of new netherland on the west side of the delaware river the british conquest of new netherland began on august 29 1664 when new amsterdam was coerced to surrender while facing cannons on british ships in new york harbor.2728 this conquest continued and was completed in october 1664 when the british captured fort casimir in what today is new castle delaware the peace of breda between england france and the netherlands confirmed the english conquest on july 21 16672930 although there were temporary reversions on september 12 1672 as part of the third anglo-dutch war the dutch re-conquered new york colony/new amsterdam the dutch established three county courts which went on to become original counties in present-day delaware and pennsylvania the one that later transferred to pennsylvania was upland.31 this was partially reversed on february 9 1674 when the treaty of westminster ended the third anglo-dutch war and reverted all political situations to the status quo ante bellum the british retained the dutch counties with their dutch names.32 by june 11 1674 new york reasserted control over the outlying colonies including upland but the names started to be changed to british names by november 11 1674.33 upland was partitioned on november 12 1674 producing the general outline of the current border between pennsylvania and delaware.34 what had been upland on what became the pennsylvania side of the pennsylvania-delaware border was renamed as chester county when pennsylvania instituted their colonial governments on march 4 1681.4041 the quaker leader william penn had signed a peace treaty with tammany leader of the delaware tribe beginning a long period of friendly relations between the quakers and the indians.42 additional treaties between quakers and other tribes followed the treaty of william penn was never violated.43 18th centuryedit between 1730 and when it was shut down by parliament with the currency act of 1764 the pennsylvania colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver the paper money was called colonial scrip the colony issued bills of credit which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution it was an interest-free proposition largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people it also promoted general employment and prosperity since the government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency benjamin franklin had a hand in creating this currency of which he said its utility was never to be disputed and it also met with the cautious approval of adam smith.44 james smith wrote that in 1763 the indians again commenced hostilities and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of pennsylvania. further this state was then a quaker government and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance from the state.45 the ensuing hostilities became known as pontiac's war after the stamp act congress of 1765 delegate john dickinson of philadelphia wrote the declaration of rights and grievances the congress was the first meeting of the thirteen colonies called at the request of the massachusetts assembly but only nine colonies sent delegates.46 dickinson then wrote letters from a farmer in pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the british colonies which were published in the pennsylvania chronicle between december 2 1767 and february 15 1768.47 when the founding fathers of the united states convened in philadelphia in 1774 12 colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress.48 the second continental congress which also met in philadelphia in may 1775 drew up and signed the declaration of independence in philadelphia49 but when that city was captured by the british the continental congress escaped westward meeting at the lancaster courthouse on saturday september 27 1777 and then to york there they and its primary author john dickinson drew up the articles of confederation that formed 13 independent colonies into a new nation later the constitution was written and philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new american nation.50 the constitution was drafted and signed at the pennsylvania state house now known as independence hall and the same building where the declaration of independence was signed.51 dickinson college of carlisle was the first college founded in the united states established in 1773 the college was ratified five days after the treaty of paris on september 9 1783 the school was founded by benjamin rush and named after john dickinson for half a century the commonwealth's general assembly legislature met at various places in the general philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in independence hall in philadelphia for 63 years.54 but it needed a more central location as for example the paxton boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware so in 1799 the general assembly moved to the lancaster courthouse54 and finally in 1812 to harrisburg.54 19th centuryedit the general assembly met in the old dauphin county court house until december 182154 when the federal-style hills capitol named for its builder stephen hills a lancaster architect was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient entrepreneurial son and namesake of john harris sr. a yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry 1733 on the east shore of the susquehanna river.55 the hills capitol burned down on february 2 1897 during a heavy snowstorm presumably because of a faulty flue.54 the general assembly met at grace methodist church on state street still standing until a new capitol could be built following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been rigged chicago architect henry ives cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building however the legislature had little money to allocate to the project and a roughly finished somewhat industrial building the cobb capitol was completed the general assembly refused to occupy the building political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to pennsylvania architects and joseph miller huston of philadelphia was chosen to design the present pennsylvania state capitol that incorporated cobb's building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907.54 the new state capitol drew rave reviews.54 its dome was inspired by the domes of st peter's basilica in rome and the united states capitol.54 president theodore roosevelt called it the most beautiful state capital in the nation and said it's the handsomest building i ever saw at the dedication in 1989 the new york times praised it as grand even awesome at moments but it is also a working building accessible to citizens .. a building that connects with the reality of daily life.54 pennsylvania was also the home of the first commercially drilled oil well in 1859 near titusville pennsylvania edwin drake successfully drilled the well which led to the first major oil boom in united states history 20th centuryedit at the beginning of the 20th century pennsylvania's economy was

forest under the authority of the weeks act of 1911 in the northwest part of the state in elk forest mckean and warren counties for the purposes of timber production and watershed protection in the

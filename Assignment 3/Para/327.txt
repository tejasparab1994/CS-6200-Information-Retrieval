cubaedit united statesedit due to the intensity of the storm texas closed many of its chemical plants and oil refineries because much of the united states oil refining capacity is located in texas the closings caused a temporary increase in the prices of gasoline home heating oil and natural gas.73 increases were particularly high in north carolina especially in the mountains where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average.74 the closing of refineries so soon after hurricane gustav and the time required to restart production also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the carolinas and tennessee partly as a result of panic buying.75 113 direct and indirect deaths have been reported in the us including 85 in texas 18 direct eight in louisiana one

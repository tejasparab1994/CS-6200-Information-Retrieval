yucatec or yucatec maya to distinguish it from other mayan languages this norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called yucatec maya that term refers only to the language and the correct name for the people is simply maya not mayans maya is one language in the mayan language family thus to refer to maya as mayans would be similar to referring to spanish people as romantics because they speak a language belonging to the romance language family.5 confusion of the term maya/mayan as an ethnic label occurs because maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term mestiza and not maya.6 matthew restall in his book the maya conquistador10 mentions a series of letters sent to the king of spain in the 16th and 17th centuries the noble maya families

yarn-based textiles that are woven into capes shirts blouses huipiles and dresses each village has its own distinctive pattern making it possible to distinguish a person's home town women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt maya cultural heritage tourismedit there is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage tourism and a national identity in the case of the maya the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism by focusing on lifeways through costumes rituals diet handicrafts language housing or other features the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture.30 global tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods services and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change.31 estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples as well as sites and objects of global historical significance.32 in this production of tourism the use of historic symbols signs and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building.33 with this type of tourism people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds tourists travel with cultural expectations which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings.34 an example of this can be seen in mayanizing tourism on roatan island honduras archaeological perspectives on heritage development and indignity. alejandro j figueroa et al. combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on roatan island honduras have become increasingly mayanized over the past decade as tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized maya past for the island non-maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed while heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups.35 notable maya peopleedit quotesedit film and televisionedit see alsoedit

weather satellite the weather satellite is a type of satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the earth satellites can be polar orbiting covering the entire earth asynchronously or geostationary hovering over the same spot on the equator.1 meteorological satellites see more than clouds and cloud systems city lights fires effects of pollution auroras sand and dust storms snow cover ice mapping boundaries of ocean currents energy flows etc other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash cloud from mount st helens and activity from other volcanoes such as mount etna.2 smoke from fires in the western united states such as colorado and utah have also been monitored other environmental satellites can detect changes in the earth's vegetation sea state ocean color and ice fields for example the 2002 prestige oil spill off the northwest coast of spain was watched carefully by the european envisat which though not a weather satellite flies an instrument asar which can see changes in the sea surface  contents  historyedit observationedit observation is typically made via different 'channels of the electromagnetic spectrum in particular the visible and infrared portions some of these channels include:78 visible spectrumedit visible-light images from weather satellites during local daylight hours are easy to interpret even by the average person clouds cloud systems such as fronts and tropical storms lakes forests mountains snow ice fires and pollution such as smoke smog dust and haze are readily apparent even wind can be determined by cloud patterns alignments and movement from successive photos.9 infrared spectrumedit typesedit each meteorological satellite is designed to use one of two different classes of orbit geostationary and polar orbiting geostationaryedit polar orbitingedit the united states has the noaa series of polar orbiting meteorological satellites presently noaa 17 and noaa 18 as primary spacecraft noaa 15 and noaa 16 as secondary spacecraft noaa 14 in standby and noaa 12 europe has the metop-a and metop-b satellites operated by eumetsat russia has the meteor and resurs series of satellites china has fy-3a 3b and 3c india has polar orbiting satellites as well dmspedit the united states department of defense's meteorological satellite dmsp can see the best of all weather vehicles with its ability to detect objects almost as 'small as a huge oil tanker in addition of all the weather satellites in orbit only dmsp can see at night in the visual some of the most spectacular photos have been recorded by the night visual sensor city lights volcanoes fires lightning meteors oil field burn-offs as well as the aurora borealis and aurora australis have been captured by this 450-mile-high space vehicle's low moonlight sensor at the same time energy use and city growth can be monitored since both major and even minor cities as well as highway lights are conspicuous this informs astronomers of light pollution the new york city blackout of 1977 was captured by one of the night orbiter dmsp space vehicles in addition to monitoring city lights these photos are a life saving asset in the detection and monitoring of fires not only do the satellites see the fires visually day and night but the thermal and infrared scanners on board these weather satellites detect potential fire sources below the surface of the earth where smoldering occurs once the fire is detected the same weather satellites provide vital information about wind that could fan or spread the fires these same cloud photos from space tell the firefighter when it will rain some of the most dramatic photos showed the 600 kuwaiti oil fires that the fleeing army of iraq started on february 23 1991 the night photos showed huge flashes far outstripping the glow of large populated areas the fires consumed millions of gallons of oil the last was doused on november 6 1991 usesedit snowfield monitoring especially in the sierra nevada can be helpful to the hydrologist keeping track of available snowpack for runoff vital to the watersheds of the western united states this information is gleaned from existing satellites of all agencies of the u.s government in addition to local on-the-ground measurements ice floes packs and bergs can also be located and tracked from weather space craft even pollution whether it is nature-made or man-made can be pinpointed the visual and infrared photos show effects of pollution from their respective areas over the entire earth aircraft and rocket pollution as well as condensation trails can also be spotted the ocean current and low level wind information gleaned from the space photos can help predict oceanic oil spill coverage and movement almost every summer sand and dust from the sahara desert in africa drifts across the equatorial regions of the atlantic ocean goes-east photos enable meteorologists to observe track and forecast this sand cloud in addition to reducing visibilities and causing respiratory problems sand clouds suppress hurricane formation by modifying the solar radiation balance of the tropics other dust storms in asia and mainland china are common and easy to spot and monitor with recent examples of dust moving across the pacific ocean and reaching north america in remote areas of the world with few local observers fires could rage out of control for days or even weeks and consume millions of acres before authorities are alerted weather satellites can be a tremendous asset in such situations nighttime photos also show the burn-off in gas and oil fields atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles have been taken by weather satellites since 1969.16 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in

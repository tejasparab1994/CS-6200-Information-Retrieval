proton rocket family as with many soviet rockets the names of recurring payloads became associated with the proton the moniker proton originates from a series of similarly named scientific satellites which were among the rocket's first payloads during the cold war it was designated the d-1/d-1e or sl-12/sl-13 by western intelligence agencies in january 2017 the proton was temporarily grounded due to the manufacturer voronezh mechanical plant having substituted a heat-resistant alloy in the engines with a cheaper metal.89  contents  historyedit a rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972 proton did not complete its state trials until 1977 at which point it was judged to have a higher than 90 reliability proton's design was kept secret until 1986 with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of mir proton launched the unmanned soviet circumlunar flights and was intended to have launched the first soviet circumlunar spaceflights before the united states flew the apollo 8 mission proton launched the salyut space stations the mir core segment and expansion modules and both the zarya and zvezda modules of the iss proton also launches commercial satellites most of them being managed by international launch services the first ils proton launch was on 9 april 1996 with the launch of the ses astra 1f communications satellite.11 proton 8k82kedit the grau index 8k82k version is now usually called proton k it is fuelled by very toxic unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.13 these are hypergolic fuels which ignite on contact avoiding the need for an ignition system and can be stored at ambient temperatures this avoids the need for components that are tolerant of low temperatures and allows the rocket to remain on the pad indefinitely other launchers with such capability include the u.s titan ii titan iii and titan iv the chinese long march 2 rocket family and long march 4 rocket family the soviet/ukrainian tsyklon launchers the soviet/russian kosmos-3 and kosmos-3m launchers and the european ariane 1 to ariane 4 launchers in contrast cryogenic fuels need periodic replenishment as they boil off the fourth stage has multiple variants depending on the mission the simplest blok d was used for interplanetary missions blok d had no guidance module depending on the probe to control flight three different blok dm versions dm dm2 and dm-2m were for high earth orbits the blok d/dm were unusual in that the fuel was stored in a toroidal tank around the engine and behind the oxidizer tank proton-k payloads including all of the soviet union's salyut space stations almost all mir modules with the exception of the docking module which was launched on the united states space shuttle and the zarya and zvezda modules of the international space station it was intended to launch the manned tks spacecraft prior to the cancellation of that programme although a few non-manned flights of spacecraft was fulfilled also it was intended for proposed in the 1970s lks spaceplane that never realised.citation needed proton-medit on 6 august 2012 the russian federal space agency lost a russian and an indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a proton-m due to technical difficulties with the last stage.15 on 2 july 2013 a proton-m launching three glonass navigation satellites experienced a failure reminiscent of the 1960s disasters shortly after liftoff when the booster crashed near lc-39 at baikonour ending a 30-year unbroken stretch without a first stage failure all future proton flights were suspended pending investigation.16 the accident was eventually determined to be caused by the rate gyro package having been installed upside-down due to the difficulty of installing the package incorrectly it was widely suspected that it had been done deliberately by a disgruntled or drunk worker at the khrunichev plant on 15 may 2014 a proton-m/briz-m carrying an ekspress satellite suffered a third stage failure from a bad turbopump bearing debris fell in manchuria on 21 october another ekspress satellite was left in a useless orbit when the briz stage cut off 24 seconds too early on 16 may 2015 a mexsat communications satellite failed to orbit due to another third stage malfunction the eighth proton failure since 2010 launchesedit future developmentsedit significant upgrades were temporarily put on hold following announcement of the new angara launch vehicle the single largest upgrade was the kvrb stage this cryogenic stage would have greatly increased capacity the engine was developed successfully and the stage as a whole had progressed to hardware however as kvrb is noticeably larger than blok d the vehicle's aerodynamics flight control software and possibly electronics would have to be reevaluated in addition the launch pad can supply existing protons with common hypergolic fuels from single sources the upper stages in particular are fed by common loading pipes running along the rocket switching to a stage with different fuels requires the addition of extra support articles switching to cryogens requires that such support articles top off the stage periodically.citation needed heavy variants of angara will be simpler and cheaper than proton and like the atlas v rocket will not use hypergolic fuels instead it will use the same rp-1 fuel as that used on the soyuz rocket they will also be designed from the start to accept a kvtk stage and will already have a lox supply at the pad only a hydrogen supply will be called upon however delays in angara development mean that protons will continue to fly for some time.citation needed see alsoedit similar launch systemsedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views

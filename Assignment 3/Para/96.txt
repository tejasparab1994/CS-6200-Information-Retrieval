nor'easter nor'easters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of november and march although they can much less commonly develop during other parts of the year as well the susceptible regions are generally impacted by nor'easters a few times each winter.456  contents  etymology and usageedit the term nor'easter came to american english by way of british english according to the oxford english dictionary the first recorded use in the english language of the term nore north in association with the points of the compass and wind direction was by dekker in 1612 how blowes the winde syr? wynde is nore-nore-west. however this is incorrect as john lyly uses the term the same way in his play of 1585 gallathea.7 similar uses occurred in 1688 nore and nore-west and in 1718 nore-west or nore-nore-west these recorded uses are predated by use of the term noreast first recorded as used by davis in 1594 noreast by north raiseth a degree in sayling 24 leagues. and shown for instance on a compass card published in 1607 thus the manner of pronouncing from memory the 32 points of the compass known in maritime training as boxing the compass is described by ansted8 with pronunciations nor'east or west nor nor'-east or west nor'east b east or west and so forth according to the oed the first recorded use of the term nor'easter occurs in 1836 in a translation of aristophanes the term nor'easter naturally developed from the historical spellings and pronunciations of the compass points and the direction of wind or sailing.citation needed as noted in a january 2006 editorial by william sisson editor of soundings magazine9 use of nor'easter to describe the storm system is common along the u.s east coast yet it has been asserted by linguist mark liberman see below that nor'easter as a contraction for northeaster has no basis in regional new england dialect the boston accent would elide the r no'theastuh' he describes nor'easter as a fake word however this view neglects the little-known etymology and the historical maritime usage described above nineteenth-century downeast mariners pronounced the compass point north northeast as no'nuth-east and so on.citation needed for decades edgar comee of brunswick maine waged a determined battle against use of the term nor'easter by the press which usage he considered a pretentious and altogether lamentable affectation and the odious even loathsome practice of landlubbers who would be seen as salty as the sea itself his efforts which included mailing hundreds of postcards were profiled just before his death at the age of 88 in the new yorker.10 university of pennsylvania linguistics professor mark liberman has pointed out that while the oxford english dictionary cites examples dating back to 1837 these examples represent the contributions of a handful of non-new england poets and writers liberman posits that nor'easter may have originally been a literary affectation akin to e'en for even and th'only for the only which is an indication in spelling that two syllables count for only one position in metered verse with no implications for actual pronunciation.12 however despite these assertions the term can be found in the writings of new englanders and was frequently used by the press in the 19th century usage existed into the 20th century in the form of geography and formation characteristicsedit formationedit in the upper atmosphere the strong winds of the jet stream remove and replace rising air from the atlantic more rapidly than the atlantic air is replaced at lower levels this and the coriolis force help develop a strong storm the storm tracks northeast along the east coast past the carolinas the mid-atlantic and the new england coastal states counterclockwise winds around the low-pressure system blow the moist air over land the relatively warm moist air meets cold air coming southward from canada the low increases the surrounding pressure difference which causes the very different air masses to collide at a faster speed when the difference in temperature of the air masses is larger so is the storm's instability turbulence and thus severity.120 the nor'easters taking the east coast track usually indicates the presence of a high-pressure area in the vicinity of nova scotia.21 sometimes a nor'easter will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain new york city philadelphia baltimore etc. and snow in new england boston northward it can move slightly offshore bringing a wet snow south of boston to richmond virginia or even parts of the carolinas.22 such a storm will rapidly intensify tracking northward and following the topography of the east coast sometimes continuing to grow stronger during its entire existence a nor'easter usually reaches its peak intensity while off the canadian coast the storm then reaches arctic areas and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak hurricane it then meanders throughout the north atlantic and can last for several weeks.22 characteristicsedit nor'easters are usually formed by an area of vorticity associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms a parent storm and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet stream until the nor'easter passes thick dark low-level clouds often block out the sun temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction during a single storm the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist all precipitation types can occur in a nor'easter high wind gusts which can reach hurricane strength are also associated with a nor'easter on very rare occasions such as in the north american blizzard of 2006 and a nor'easter in 1978 the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a hurricane and have a small dry slot near the center which can be mistaken for an eye although it is not an eye difference from tropical cyclonesedit often people mistake nor'easters for tropical cyclones and do not differentiate between the two weather systems nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor'easters are cold-core low-pressure systems meaning that they thrive on cold air tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems which means they thrive on warm temperatures difference from other extratropical stormsedit a nor'easter is formed in a strong extratropical cyclone usually experiencing bombogenesis while this formation occurs in many places around the world nor'easters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the pacific northeast northern japan and northwards with winds from nw-n in europe similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow though ne winds can be strong geographyedit the eastern united states from north carolina to maine and eastern canada can experience nor'easters though most often they affect the areas from northern new jersey northward the effects of a nor'easter sometimes bring high tides and strong winds as far south as coastal south carolina and georgia surfers wait in anticipation when a nor'easter is formed nor'easters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areas biologists at the woods hole oceanographic institution on cape cod have determined nor'easters are an environmental factor for red tides on the atlantic coast see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation

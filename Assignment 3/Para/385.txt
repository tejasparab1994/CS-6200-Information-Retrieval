climate oscillation a climate oscillation or climate cycle is any recurring cyclical oscillation within global or regional climate and is a type of climate pattern these fluctuations in atmospheric temperature sea surface temperature precipitation or other parameters can be quasi-periodic often occurring on inter-annual multi-annual decadal multidecadal century-wide millennial or longer timescales they are not perfectly periodic and a fourier analysis of the data does not give a sharp spectrum records of past climate conditions are recovered through geological examination of proxies found in glacier ice sea bed sediment tree ring studies or otherwise  contents  examplesedit many oscillations on different time-scales are hypothesized although the causes may be unknown some of them are more like a random walk than an oscillation. here is a list of known or proposed climatic oscillationscitation needed   anomalies in oscillations sometimes occur when they coincide as in the arctic dipole anomaly a combination of the arctic and north atlantic oscillations and the longer-term younger dryas a sudden non-linear cooling event that occurred at the onset of the current holocene interglacial in the case of volcanoes large eruptions such as mount tambora in 1816 which led to the year without a summer typically cool the climate especially when the volcano is located in the tropics around 70 000 years ago the toba supervolcano eruption created an especially cold period during the ice age leading to a possible genetic bottleneck in human populations however outgassing from large igneous provinces such as the permian siberian traps can input carbon dioxide into the atmosphere warming the climate triggering of other mechanisms such as methane clathrate deposits as during the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum increased the rate of climatic temperature change and oceanic extinctions another longer-term near-millennial oscillation involves the daansgard-oeschger cycles occurring on roughly 1500-year cycles during the last glacial maximum they may be related to the holocene bond events and may involve factors similar to those responsible for heinrich events origins and causesedit there are close correlations between earth's climate oscillations and astronomical factors barycenter changes solar variation cosmic ray flux cloud albedo feedback milankovic cycles and modes of heat distribution between the ocean-atmosphere climate system in some cases current historical and paleoclimatological natural oscillations may be masked by significant volcanic eruptions impact events irregularities in climate proxy data positive feedback processes or anthropogenic emissions of substances such as greenhouse gases.24 effectsedit extreme phases of short-term climate oscillations such as enso can result in characteristic patterns of floods and droughts including megadroughts monsoonal disruption and extreme temperatures in the form of heat waves and cold waves shorter-term climate oscillations typically do not directly result in longer-term climate change in temperatures however the effects of underlying climate trends such as recent global warming and oscillations can be cumulative to global temperature producing shorter-term fluctuations in the instrumental and satellite temperature records collapses of past civilizations such as the maya may be related to cycles of precipitation especially drought that in this example also correlates to the western hemisphere warm pool one example of possible correlations between factors affecting the climate and global events popular with the media is a 2003 study on the correlation between wheat prices and sunspot numbers.5 analysis and uncertaintiesedit radiative forcings and other factors in a climate oscillation must obey the laws of atmospheric thermodynamics however because earth's climate is inherently a complex system simple fourier analysis or climate modelling often does not create a perfect replication of the observed or inferred conditions no climate cycle is found to be perfectly periodic although the milankovich cycles based on multiple superimposed orbital cycles and earth's precession are quite close to being periodic perhaps almost periodic? one difficulty in detecting climate cycles is that the earth's climate has been changing in non-cyclic ways over most paleoclimatological timescales for instance we are now in a period of global warming that appears anthropogenic in a larger timeframe the earth is emerging from the latest ice age cooling from the holocene climatic optimum and warming from the so-called little ice age which means that climate has been constantly changing over the last 15000 years or so during warm periods temperature fluctuations are often of a lesser amplitude the pleistocene period dominated by repeated glaciations developed out of more stable conditions in the miocene and pliocene climate holocene climate has been relatively stable all of these changes complicate the task of looking for cyclical behavior in the climate positive feedback negative feedback and ecological inertia from the land-ocean-atmosphere system often attenuate or reverse smaller effects whether from orbital forcings solar variations or changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases most climatologists recognize the existence of various tipping points that push small forcings beyond a certain threshold that makes the change irreversible while the forcings are still in place certain feedbacks involvong processes such as clouds are also uncertain for contrails natural cirrus clouds oceanic dimethyl sulfide and a land-based equivalent competing theories exist concerning effects on climatic temperatures for example contrasting the iris hypothesis and claw hypothesis through geologic and historical timeedit in contrast several warm periods have also taken place and they include but are not limited to certain effects have occurred during these cycles for example during the medieval warm period the american midwest was in drought including the sand hills of nebraska which were active sand dunes the black death plague of yersinia pestis also occurred during medieval temperature fluctuations and may be related to changing climates see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

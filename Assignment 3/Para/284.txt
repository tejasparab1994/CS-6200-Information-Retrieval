maximum sustained wind  contents  definitionedit determination of valueedit in most tropical cyclone basins use of the satellite-based dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds.4 the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used within the technique to assign a maximum sustained wind and pressure.5 central pressure values for their centers of low pressure are approximate the intensity of example hurricanes is derived from both the time of landfall and the maximum intensity.6 the tracking of individual clouds on minutely satellite imagery could be used in the future in estimating surface winds speeds for tropical cyclones.7 ship and land observations are also used when available in the atlantic as well as the central and eastern pacific basins reconnaissance aircraft are still utilized to fly through tropical cyclones to determine flight level winds which can then be adjusted to provide a fairly reliable estimate of maximum sustained winds a reduction of 10 percent of the winds sampled at flight level is used to estimate the maximum sustained winds near the surface which has been determined during the past decade through the use of gps dropwindsondes.8 doppler weather radar can be used in the same manner to determine surface winds with tropical cyclones near land.9 variationedit friction between the atmosphere and the earth's surface causes a 20 reduction in the wind at the surface of the earth.10 surface roughness also leads to significant variation of wind speeds over land winds maximize at hill or mountain crests while sheltering leads to lower wind speeds in valleys and lee slopes.11 compared to over water maximum sustained winds over land average 8 lower.12 more specifically over a city or rough terrain the wind gradient effect could cause a reduction of 40 to 50 of the geostrophic wind speed aloft while over open water or ice the reduction is between 10 and 30%.81314 relationship to tropical cyclone strength scalesedit see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

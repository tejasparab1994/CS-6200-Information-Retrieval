the bahamas the bahamas is the site of columbus first landfall in the new world in 1492 at that time the islands were inhabited by the lucayan a branch of the arawakan-speaking taino people although the spanish never colonised the bahamas they shipped the native lucayans to slavery in hispaniola the islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 when english colonists from bermuda settled on the island of eleuthera the bahamas became a british crown colony in 1718 when the british clamped down on piracy after the american war of independence the crown resettled thousands of american loyalists in the bahamas they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants africans constituted the majority of the population from this period the slave trade was abolished by the british in 1807 slavery in the bahamas was abolished in 1834 the bahamas became a haven for freed african slaves the royal navy resettled africans here liberated from illegal slave ships american slaves and seminoles escaped here from florida and the government freed american slaves carried on united states domestic ships that had reached the bahamas due to weather today afro-bahamians make up nearly 90 of the population the bahamas became an independent commonwealth realm in 1973 retaining the british monarch then and currently queen elizabeth ii as its head of state in terms of gross domestic product per capita the bahamas is one of the richest countries in the americas following the united states and canada with an economy based on tourism and finance.12  contents  etymologyedit a peculiarity of the name is that the word the is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is therefore capitalised so in contrast to the congo and the united kingdom it is proper to write the bahamas historyedit taino people moved into the uninhabited southern bahamas from hispaniola and cuba around the 11th century having migrated there from south america they came to be known as the lucayan people an estimated 30000 lucayan inhabited the bahamas at the time of christopher columbus arrival in 1492 columbus's first landfall in the new world was on an island he named san salvador known to the lucayan as guanahani some researchers believe this site to be present-day san salvador island formerly known as watling's island situated in the southeastern bahamas an alternative theory holds that columbus landed to the southeast on samana cay according to calculations made in 1986 by national geographic writer and editor joseph judge based on columbus's log evidence in support of this remains inconclusive on the landfall island columbus made first contact with the lucayan and exchanged goods with them the spanish forced much of the lucayan population to hispaniola for use as forced labour the slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity half of the taino died from smallpox alone.16 the population of the bahamas was severely diminished.17 in 1670 king charles ii granted the islands to the lords proprietors of the carolinas in north america they rented the islands from the king with rights of trading tax appointing governors and administering the country.18 in 1684 spanish corsair juan de alcon raided the capital charles town later renamed nassau in 1703 a joint franco-spanish expedition briefly occupied the bahamian capital during the war of the spanish succession during the american war of independence in the late 18th century the islands became a target for american naval forces under the command of commodore esek hopkins us marines occupied the capital of nassau for a fortnight in 1782 following the british defeat at yorktown a spanish fleet appeared off the coast of nassau the city surrendered without a fight spain returned possession of the bahamas to britain the following year under the terms of the treaty of paris before the news was received however the islands were recaptured by a small british force led by andrew deveaux after american independence the british resettled some 7300 loyalists with their slaves in the bahamas and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent these loyalists who included deveaux established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital european americans were outnumbered by the african-american slaves they brought with them and ethnic europeans remained a minority in the territory in 1807 the british abolished the slave trade followed by the united states the next year during the following decades the royal navy intercepted the trade they resettled in the bahamas thousands of africans liberated from slave ships in the 1820s during the period of the seminole wars in florida hundreds of american slaves and african seminoles escaped from cape florida to the bahamas they settled mostly on northwest andros island where they developed the village of red bays from eyewitness accounts 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823 aided by bahamians in 27 sloops with others using canoes for the journey this was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at bill baggs cape florida state park.2021 some of their descendants in red bays continue african seminole traditions in basket making and grave marking.22 the united states national park service which administers the national underground railroad network to freedom is working with the african bahamian museum and research center abac in nassau on development to identify red bays as a site related to american slaves search for freedom the museum has researched and documented the african seminoles escape from southern florida it plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in red bay associated with the period of their settlement in the bahamas.23 in 181824 the home office in london had ruled that any slave brought to the bahamas from outside the british west indies would be manumitted. this led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by us nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.25 the american slave ships comet and encomium used in the united states domestic coastwise slave trade were wrecked off abaco island in december 1830 and february 1834 respectively when wreckers took the masters passengers and slaves into nassau customs officers seized the slaves and british colonial officials freed them over the protests of the americans there were 165 slaves on the comet and 48 on the encomium britain finally paid an indemnity to the united states in those two cases in 1855 under the treaty of claims of 1853 which settled several compensation cases between the two nations.2627 slavery was abolished in the british empire on 1 august 1834 after that british colonial officials freed 78 american slaves from the enterprise which went into bermuda in 1835 and 38 from the hermosa which wrecked off abaco island in 1840.28 the most notable case was that of the creole in 1841 as a result of a slave revolt on board the leaders ordered the american brig to nassau it was carrying 135 slaves from virginia destined for sale in new orleans the bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands the creole case has been described as the most successful slave revolt in u.s history.29 these incidents in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to us nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842 increased tension between the united states and great britain they had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade but worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value the united states argued that britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade the united states worried that the success of the creole slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships 20th centuryedit in august 1940

of civil unrest over low wages in nassau in june 1942 when there was a full-scale riot.34 ziegler said that the duke blamed the trouble on mischief makers  communists and men of central european jewish descent who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft.35 the duke resigned the post on 16 march 1945.3637 post-second world waredit modern political development began

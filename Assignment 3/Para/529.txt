hawker hurricane the hurricane originated from discussions during the early 1930s between raf officials and british aircraft designer sir sydney camm on the topic of a proposed monoplane derivative of the hawker fury biplane despite an institutional preference for biplanes at the time and repeated lack of interest by the air ministry hawker chose to continue refining their monoplane proposal which resulted in the incorporation of several innovations that would become critical to wartime fighter aircraft such as a retractable undercarriage and the newly developed rolls-royce merlin engine in late 1934 the air ministry placed an order for hawker's interceptor monoplane on 6 november 1935 the prototype hurricane k5083 performed its maiden flight in june 1936 the hurricane was ordered into production by the air ministry the type entered squadron service on 25 december 1937 the manufacture and maintenance of the aircraft was greatly eased by its use of conventional construction methods which enabled squadrons to perform many major repairs themselves without much external support the hurricane was rapidly procured prior to the outbreak of the second world war in september 1939 by which point the raf operated a total of 18 hurricane-equipped squadrons the aircraft quickly found itself being heavily relied upon to defend against the vast and varied german aircraft operated by luftwaffe including dogfighting with the capable messerschmitt bf 109 across multiple theatres of action it is perhaps best known for its contribution to britain's home defences during the battle of britain  contents  developmentedit originsedit during the era in which the hawker aircraft company would develop the hurricane raf fighter command consisted of just 13 squadrons each equipped with either the hawker fury hawker demon or the bristol bulldog all biplanes furnished with fixed-pitch wooden propellers and non-retractable undercarriages.45 at the time there was an institutional reluctance towards change within the air staff according to aviation author francis k mason some senior figures were prejudiced against the adoption of monoplane fighter aircraft while mid-level officers were typically approachable on the subject and design concepts that made use of such configurations.5 in 1934 the british air ministry issued specification f.7/30 in response to demands within the royal air force raf for a new generation of fighter aircraft earlier during 1933 british aircraft designer sydney camm had conducted discussions with major john buchanan of the directorate of technical development on a monoplane based on the existing fury.6 mason attributes camm's discussions with figures within the raf such as squadron leader ralph sorley as having provoked the specification and some of its details such as the preference for armaments being installed within the wings instead of within the aircraft's nose.7 camm's initial submission in response to f.7/30 the hawker p.v.3 was essentially a scaled-up version of the fury biplane.8 however the p.v.3 was not among the proposals which the air ministry had selected to be constructed as a government-sponsored prototype after the rejection of the p.v.3 proposal camm commenced work upon a new design involving a cantilever monoplane arrangement complete with a fixed undercarriage armed with four machine guns and powered by the rolls-royce goshawk engine the original 1934 armament specifications for what would evolve into the hurricane were for a similar armament fitment to the gloster gladiator four machine-guns two in the wings and two in the fuselage synchronized to fire through the propeller arc by january 1934 the proposal's detail drawings had been finished but these failed to impress the air ministry enough for a prototype to be ordered.9 camm's response to this rejection was to further develop the design during which a retractable undercarriage was introduced and the unsatisfactory goshawk engine was replaced by a new rolls-royce design initially designated as the pv-12 which would subsequently go on to become famous as the merlin engine in august 1934 a one-tenth scale model of the design was produced and dispatched to the national physical laboratory at teddington a series of wind tunnel tests confirmed the aerodynamic qualities of the aircraft were in order and in september 1934 camm again approached the air ministry this time the ministry's response was favourable and a prototype of the interceptor monoplane was promptly ordered.10 prototype and trialsedit in november 1934 the air ministry issued specification f.5/34 which drawing on the work of squadron leader ralph sorley called for new fighter aircraft to be armed with a total of eight guns however by this time work had progressed too far to immediately modify the planned four-gun installation by january 1935 a wooden mock-up had been finished and although a number of suggestions for detail changes were made construction of the prototype was approved and a new specification f.36/34 was written around the design in july 1935 this specification was amended to include installation of eight guns.117 by the end of august 1935 work on the airframe performed at hawker's kingston upon thames facility had been completed and the aircraft components were transported to brooklands surrey where hawker had an assembly shed on 23 october 1935 the prototype was fully re-assembled.7 ground testing and taxi trials took place over the following two weeks on 6 november 1935 the prototype k5083 took to the air for the first time at the hands of hawker's chief test pilot flight lieutenant george bulman.12 bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing philip lucas flew some of the experimental test flights while john hindmarsh conducted the firm's production flight trials.13 as completed the prototype had been fitted with ballast to represent the aircraft's armament prior to the acceptance of the final multi-gun wing armament.14 by march 1936 a total of ten flying hours had been performed by the prototype covering all major portions of the flight envelope early flight testing had gone reasonably well especially in light of the trial status of the merlin engine which had itself yet to achieve full flight certification at this time and thus severe restrictions had been imposed upon use of the engine.7 in early 1936 the prototype was transferred to raf martlesham heath suffolk to participate in initial service trials under the direction of squadron leader d f anderson sammy wroath later to be the founding commandant of the empire test pilot school was the raf test pilot for the hurricane his report was favorable stating that the aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices and proceeded to praise its control response.15 in the course of further testing it was found that the hurricane had poor spin recovery characteristics in which all rudder authority could be lost due to shielding of the rudder.16 hawker's response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived but the air ministry refused the request;17 the situation was resolved by the royal aircraft establishment rae who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral fairing and extension of the bottom of the rudder this discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.18 in early 1936 the hawker board of directors had decided in the absence of official authorisation and at company expense to proceed with issuing the design drawings to the production design office and to commence tooling-up for a production line capable of producing a batch of 1000 hurricanes.1920 productionedit in june 1936 the hurricane was formally ordered into production the air ministry having placed its first order that month for 600 aircraft.16 on 26 june 1936 the type name hurricane which had been proposed by hawker was approved by the air ministry an informal christening ceremony for the aircraft was carried out during the following month during an official visit by king edward viii to martlesham heath.2116 a key reason for the aircraft's appeal was its relatively simple construction and ease of manufacture in comparison to the supermarine spitfire it was significantly cheaper and involved less labour requiring 10300 man hours to produce versus 15200 for the spitfire.22 as a large-scale war was looking increasingly likely and time was of the essence in providing the raf with an effective fighter aircraft it was unclear if the more advanced spitfire would enter production smoothly while the hurricane made use of well-understood manufacturing techniques.22 this factor was equally applicable for its use within service squadrons as well which were experienced in working on and repairing aircraft whose construction employed the same principles as the hurricane and the simplicity of its design enabled the improvisation of some remarkable repairs in squadron workshops.22 a fabric-covered wing patterned upon traditional hawker designs was initially adopted in order to speed up production a higher-performing stressed-skin metal wing took its place in late 1939.16 on 12 october 1937 the maiden flight took place of the first production hurricane i which was powered by a merlin ii engine and flown by flight lieutenant philip lucas production deliveries had been delayed by roughly six months due to a decision to equip the hurricane only with the improved merlin ii engine while the earlier merlin i had been prioritised for the fairey battle and the hawker henley.16 by the following december the first four aircraft to enter service with the raf had joined no 111 squadron stationed at raf northolt by february 1938 no 111 squadron had received 16 hurricanes.16 upon the outbreak of the second world war nearly 500 hurricanes had been produced which had equipped a total of 18 squadrons while a further 3500 aircraft were on order.2324 during 1940 lord beaverbrook who was the minister of aircraft production established an organisation in which a number of manufacturers were seconded to repair and overhaul battle-damaged hurricanes the civilian repair organisation also overhauled battle-weary aircraft which were later sent to training units or to other air forces one of the factories involved was the austin aero company's cofton hackett plant another was david rosenfield ltd based at barton aerodrome near manchester a major manufacturer of the hurricane was canada car and foundry at their factory in fort william ontario canada the facility's chief engineer elsie macgill became known as the queen of the hurricanes.24 the initiative was commercially led rather than governmentally but was endorsed by the british government hawker having recognised that a major conflict was all but inevitable after the munich crisis of 1938 drew up preliminary plans to expand hurricane production via a new factory in canada under this plan samples pattern aircraft and a complete set of design documents stored on microfilm were shipped to canada 22 early british-produced hurricanes were transferred to support the development.24 as a result canadian-built hurricanes were shipped to britain to participate in events such as the battle of britain.24 overall some 14000 hurricanes and sea hurricanes were produced.3clarification needed the majority of hurricanes were built by hawker who produced the type until 1944 while hawker's sister company the gloster aircraft company constructed 2750 the austin aero company completed 300 hurricanes canada car and foundry was responsible for the production of 1400 hurricanes designated as the mk x designedit the hawker hurricane is a low-wing cantilever monoplane outfitted with retractable undercarriage and an enclosed cockpit for the pilot.27 a clean single-seat fighter it was developed to provide a competent combatant for aerial combat against the latest fighter designs that were emerging amongst the air services of other powers of the era the hurricane was initially armed with an arrangement of eight remotely-operated wing-mounted browning machine guns intended for conducting rapid engagements.28 the hurricane was typically equipped for flying under both day and night conditions being provided with navigation lights harley landing lights complete blind-flying equipment and two-way radios upon its entry to service much of the performance data was intentionally concealed from the general public but it was known that the type possessed a speed range of 6:1.29 though faster and more advanced than the raf's current front line biplane fighters the design of the hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes.30 hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior.31 the primary structure comprised a warren truss box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel longerons and duralumin cross-bracing which were mechanically fastened instead of welded.32 over this a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape which carried a doped linen covering the majority of the external surfaces were linen save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.33 similarly a simple steel tube structure in the nose of the fuselage was used to support the engine detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the engine's areas for inspection or adjustment purposes.34 installed underneath the fuselage the liquid-cooled radiator has a rectangular opening to its aft this is covered by a hinged flap via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level an atypical feature for the era was the use of tungum pipes throughout the cooling system.34 initially the structure of the hurricane's cantilever wing consisted of two steel spars which possessed considerable strength and stiffness.35 the wing was described by aviation publication flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts forming separate units between the front and rear spars hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the inner end of the wings.36 the original wing was predominantly fabric-covered like the fuselage while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its leading edge the majority of the flight control surfaces such as the frise-type ailerons also had fabric coverings.36 the hurricane was furnished with a laterally-retracting undercarriage the main undercarriage units being able to slide into recesses within the wing.34 hinged telescopic vickers-built legs are attached to the bottom boom of the wing's forward spar but with a complex pintle angle setup within the wing at the top of the strut to allow the strut to be angled forwards when extended and rearwards when retracted to clear the forward spar a hydraulic jack served to actuate the undercarriage folding and pivoting the legs as to reposition the wheel unit rearwards well as inwards in order to clear the front spar when retracted.34 two separate hydraulic systems one being power-operated and the other hand operated are present for the deployment and retraction of the undercarriage in the event of both failing pilots can release the retaining catches holding the undercarriage in place deploying the wheels to the 'down position using weight alone a wide wheel-track was used to allow for considerable stability during ground movements and to enable tight turns to be performed.38 camm's priority was to provide the pilot with good all-round visibility to this end the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage creating a distinctive hump-backed silhouette pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable stirrup mounted below the trailing edge of the port wing this was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage just behind the cockpit when the flap was shut the footstep retracted into the fuselage in addition both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material an advantage of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding even if one of the steel tubes were damaged the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by ground crew at the airfield damage to a stressed skin structure as used by the spitfire required more specialised equipment to repair.41 the old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions crated hurricanes were assembled at takoradi in west africa and flown across the sahara to the middle east theatre and to save space some royal navy aircraft carriers carried their reserve sea hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed in contrast the contemporary spitfire used all-metal monocoque construction and was thus both lighter and stronger though less tolerant to bullet damage with its ease of maintenance widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics the hurricane remained in use in theatres of operations where reliability easy handling and a stable gun platform were more important than performance typically in roles like ground attack one of the design requirements of the original specification was that both the hurricane and the spitfire were also to be used as night fighters the hurricane proved to be a relatively simple aircraft to fly at night and shot down several german aircraft on night raids from early 1941 the hurricane was also used as an intruder aircraft patrolling german airfields in france at night to catch bombers taking off or landing operational historyedit pre-waredit by the middle of 1938 the first 50 hurricanes had reached squadrons and at that time it had been assessed that the rate of production was slightly greater than the raf's capacity to introduce the new aircraft which had already been accelerated.42 accordingly the british government gave hawker the clearance to sell excess aircraft to nations that were likely to oppose german expansion as a result there were some modest export sales made to other countries at the earliest opportunity a former raf hurricane i was dispatched to yugoslavia for evaluation purposes.42 shortly after this evaluation an order for 24 hurricane mark is for the royal yugoslav air force was received this was followed by the purchase of a production licence for the hurricane by yugoslavia.25 yugoslavia hurricanes saw action against the luftwaffe during the invasion of yugoslavia in 1941 by the axis powers.24 hurricane production was increased as part of a plan to create a reserve of attrition aircraft as well as re-equip existing squadrons and newly formed ones such as those of the auxiliary air force expansion scheme e included a target of 500 fighters of all types by the start of 1938 by the time of the munich crisis there were only two fully operational raf squadrons of the planned 12 to be equipped with hurricanes.43 by the time of the german invasion of poland there were 18 operational hurricane squadrons and three more that were in the process of converting.citation needed the phoney waredit in response to a request from the french government for the provision of 10 fighter squadrons to provide air support air chief marshal sir hugh dowding commander-in-chief of raf fighter command insisted that this number would deplete british defences severely and so initially only four squadrons of hurricanes 1 73 85 and 87 were relocated to france keeping spitfires back for home defence.45 the first to arrive was no.73 squadron on 10 september 1939 followed shortly by the other three a little later 607 and 615 squadrons joined them.46 after his first flight in october 1939 hurricane pilot roland beamont subsequently flew operationally with 87 squadron claiming three enemy aircraft during the french campaign and delivered great praise for his aircraft's performance throughout the bad days of 1940 87 sqn had maintained a proficient formation aerobatic team the precise flying controls and responsive engines permitting precision formation through loops barrel rolls 1g semi-stall turns and rolls off half-loops .. my hurricane was never hit in the battles of france and britain and in over 700 hr on type i never experienced an engine failure battle of franceedit in may 1940 nos 3 79 and 504 squadrons reinforced the earlier units as germany's blitzkrieg gathered momentum on 10 may the first day of the battle of france flight lieutenant r e lovett and flying officer fanny orton of 73 squadron were the first r.a.f pilots to engage enemy aircraft in the campaign they attacked one of three dornier do 17s from 4 staffel/kg 2 that were flying over their airfield at rouvres-en-woevre the dornier went away unscathed while orton was hit by defensive fire and had to force land.51 on the same day the hurricane squadrons claimed 42 german aircraft none of them fighters shot down during 208 sorties seven hurricanes were lost but no pilots were killed.51 on 12 may several hurricanes units were committed to escort bombers that morning five fairey battle volunteer crews from 12 squadron took off from amifontaine base to bomb vroenhoven and veldwezelt bridges on the meuse at maastricht the escort consisted of eight hurricanes of 1 squadron with squadron leader p j h bull halahan in the lead when the formation approached maastricht it was bounced by 16 bf 109es from 2./jg 27 two battles and two hurricanes including halahan's were shot down two more battles were brought down by flak and the fifth bomber had to crash-land the 1 squadron pilots claimed four messerschmitts and two heinkel he 112sn 2 while the luftwaffe actually lost only one bf 109.5253 by 17 may the end of the first week of fighting only three of the squadrons were near operational strength but the hurricanes had managed to destroy nearly twice as many german aircraft.57 on 18 may 1940 air combat continued from dawn to dusk hurricane pilots claimed 57 german aircraft and 20 probables luftwaffe records show 39 aircraft lost the following day 1 and 73 squadrons claimed 11 german aircraft three by cobber kain and three by paul richey on these two days hurricanes suffered heavier losses with 68 hurricanes shot down or forced to crash-land due to combat damage fifteen pilots were killed eight were taken prisoner and 11 injured two-thirds of the hurricanes had been shot down by messerschmitt bf 109s and bf 110s.58 in the afternoon of 20 may 1940 the hurricane units based in northern france were ordered to abandon their bases on the continent and return to great britain on the same day bull halahan requested the repatriation of the pilots serving in 1 squadron during the previous 10 days the unit had been the most successful of the campaign it had claimed 63 victories for the loss of five pilots two killed one taken prisoner and two hospitalised 1 squadron was awarded ten dfcs and three dfms during the blitzkrieg.59 on the evening of 21 may the only hurricanes still operational were those of the aasf that had been moved to bases around troyes.60 operation dynamoedit during operation dynamo the evacuation from dunkirk of british french and belgian troops cut off by the german army during the battle of dunkirk the hawker hurricanes operated from british bases between 26 may and 3 june 1940 the 14 hurricane units involved were credited with 108 air victories a total of 27 hurricane pilots became aces during operation dynamo led by canadian pilot officer w l willie mcknight 10 victories and pilot officer percival stanley turner seven victories who served in no 242 squadron consisting mostly of canadian personnel.63 losses were 22 pilots killed and three captured.64 on 27 may 1940 in one of the final mass encounters of the blitzkrieg 13 hurricanes from 501 squadron intercepted 24 heinkel he 111s escorted by 20 bf 110s during the ensuing battle 11 heinkels were claimed as kills and others damaged with little damage to the hurricanes.66 on 7 june 1940 cobber kain the first raf ace of the war got word that he was to return to england for rest leave at an operational training unit on leaving his airfield he put on an impromptu aerobatic display and was killed when his hurricane crashed after completing a loop and attempting some low altitude flick rolls.67 hurricanes equipped with rotol constant-speed propellers were delivered to raf squadrons in may 1940 with deliveries continuing throughout the battle of britain according to aviation author david donald the rotol propeller had the effect of transforming the hurricane's performance from disappointing to acceptable mediocrity modified aircraft were reportedly much sought after among squadrons which had also been equipped with hurricanes that were fitted with the older de havilland two-position propeller.7273 battle of britainedit at the end of june 1940 following the fall of france the majority of the raf's 36 fighter squadrons were equipped with hurricanes.74 the battle of britain officially lasted from 10 july until 31 october 1940 but the heaviest fighting took place between 8 august and 21 september both the supermarine spitfire and the hurricane are renowned for their part in defending britain against the luftwaffe generally the spitfire would intercept the german fighters leaving hurricanes to concentrate on the bombers but despite the undoubted abilities of the thoroughbred spitfire it was the workhorse hurricane that scored the higher number of raf victories during this period accounting for 55 percent of the 2739 german losses according to fighter command compared with 42 per cent by spitfires.75 on 8 august 1940 hurricanes of no 145 squadron were recorded as having fired the first shots of the battle of britain.76 as a fighter the hurricane had some drawbacks it was slightly slower than both the spitfire i and ii and the messerschmitt bf 109e and the thicker wing profiles compromised acceleration but it could out-turn both of them in spite of its performance deficiencies against the bf 109 the hurricane was still capable of destroying the german fighter especially at lower altitudes the standard tactic of the 109s was to attempt to climb higher than the raf fighters and bounce them in a dive the hurricanes could evade such tactics by turning into the attack or going into a corkscrew dive which the 109s with their lower rate of roll found hard to counter if a 109 was caught in a dogfight the hurricane was just as capable of out-turning the 109 as the spitfire in a stern chase the 109 could evade the hurricane.78 the hurricane was a steady gun platform81 and had demonstrated its ruggedness as several were badly damaged yet returned to base but the hurricane's construction made it dangerous if it caught fire the wood frames and fabric covering of the rear fuselage allowed fire to spread through the rear fuselage structure easily in addition the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat right in front of the instrument panel without any form of protection for the pilot many hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could burn through the instrument panel this became of such concern to hugh dowding that he had hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of the hurricanes with a self-expanding rubber coating called linatex.82 if the tank happened to be punctured by a bullet the linatex coating would expand when soaked with petrol and seal it.83 some hurricane pilots also felt that the fuel tanks in the wings although they were protected with a layer of linatex were vulnerable from behind and it was thought that these not the fuselage tank were the main fire risk.8485 from 10 july to 11 august 1940 raf fighters fired at 114 german bombers and shot down 80 a destruction ratio of 70 per cent against the bf 109 the raf fighters attacked 70 and shot down 54 of these a ratio of 77 per cent it has been suggested that part of the success of the british fighters was possibly due to the use of the de wilde incendiary round.86 the hurricane with the highest number of kills during the battle of britain was p3308 a mk1 flown between 15 august and 7 october 1940 by raf auxiliary pilot archie mckellar of 605 squadron.87 he is credited with 21 kills 19 of those in a hurricane during the battle of britain on 7 october he is credited with shooting down 5 bf 109s making him one of only 2 raf pilots the other brian carbury of new zealand to become an ace in a day during the battle of britain.8889 during his brief fighting career mckellar earned the dso 90 dfc  bar 9192 mackellar has remained in relative obscurity in battle of britain history as he was killed in action one day after the date set by the war ministry after the war as the official end date for the battle of britain he was killed on 1 november 1940 while taking on a superior number of bf109s.93 as in the spitfire the merlin engine suffered from negative-g cut-out a problem not cured until the introduction of miss shilling's orifice in early 1941 the only battle of britain victoria cross and the only one awarded to a member of fighter command during the war94 was awarded to flight lieutenant eric nicolson of 249 squadron as a result of an action on 16 august 1940 when his section of three hurricanes was bounced from above by bf 110 fighters all three were hit simultaneously nicolson was badly wounded and his hurricane was damaged and engulfed in flames while attempting to leave the cockpit nicolson noticed that one of the bf 110s had overshot his aircraft he returned to the cockpit which by now was an inferno engaged the enemy and may have shot down the bf 110.9596n 7 night fighters and intrudersedit following the battle of britain the hurricane continued to give service through the blitz of 1941 it was the principal single-seat night fighter in fighter command f/lt richard stevens claimed 14 luftwaffe bombers flying hurricanes in 1941 in 1942 the cannon-armed mk iic performed further afield as a night intruder over occupied europe f/lt karel kuttelwascher of 1 squadron proved the top scorer with 15 luftwaffe bombers claimed shot down 1942 also saw the manufacture of twelve hurricane ii cnf night fighters equipped with pilot-operated air interception mark vi radar after a brief operational deployment with no 245 and no 247 squadron raf during which these aircraft proved too slow for operations in europe the aircraft were sent to india to serve with no 176 squadron raf in the defence of calcutta.98 they were withdrawn from service at the end of december 1943.99 north africaedit in the spring of 1943 during the german ochsenkopf offensive in tunisia hurricane mkiids conducted many sorties after fog had lifted helping to blunt the final attack at hunts gap.105 defence of maltaedit the hurricane played a significant role in the defence of malta when italy entered the war on 10 june 1940 malta's air defence rested on gloster gladiators which managed to hold out against vastly superior numbers of the italian air force during the following 17 days according to myth after the first one was lost the remaining three were named faith hope and charity in reality there were at least six gladiators. four hurricanes joined them at the end of june and together they faced attacks throughout july from the 200 enemy aircraft based in sicily with the loss of one gladiator and one hurricane further reinforcements arrived on 2 august in the form of 12 more hurricanes and two blackburn skuas.106 n 8 the increasing number of british aircraft on the island at last prompted the italians to employ german junkers ju 87 dive bombers to try to destroy the airfields finally in an attempt to overcome the stiff resistance put up by these few aircraft the luftwaffe took up base on the sicilian airfields only to find that malta was not an easy target after numerous attacks on the island over the following months and the arrival of an extra 23 hurricanes at the end of april 1941 and a further delivery a month later the luftwaffe left sicily for the russian front in june that year.108 air defence in russiaedit the hawker hurricane was the first allied lend-lease aircraft to be delivered to the soviet union with a total of 2952 hurricanes eventually delivered109 becoming the most numerous british aircraft in soviet service.110 many soviet pilots were disappointed by the hawker fighter regarding it as inferior to both german and russian aircraft.109111 during 1941 mk ii hurricanes played an important air defence role when the soviet union found itself under threat from the approaching german army who were advancing across a broad front stretching from leningrad and moscow to the oil fields in the south britain's decision to aid the soviets meant sending supplies by sea to the far northern ports and as the convoys would need to sail within range of enemy air attack from the luftwaffe based in neighbouring finland it was decided to deliver a number of hurricane mk iibs flying with nos 81 and 134 squadrons of no 151 wing raf to provide protection twenty-four were transported on the carrier argus arriving just off murmansk on 28 august 1941 and another 15 crated aircraft on board merchant vessels in addition to their convoy protection duties the aircraft also acted as escorts to russian bombers enemy attention to the area declined in october at which point the raf pilots trained their soviet counterparts to operate the hurricanes themselves by the end of the year the raf's direct role in the region had ended but the aircraft themselves remained behind and became the first of thousands of allied aircraft that were accepted by the soviet union.112 although soviet pilots were not universally enthusiastic about the hurricane twice hero of the soviet union lt col boris safonov loved the hurricane and raf hurricane mk iib fighters operating from soviet soil in defence of murmansk destroyed 15 luftwaffe aircraft for only one loss in combat.113 however in some soviet war memoirs the hurricane has been described in very unflattering terms.114 burma ceylon singapore and the netherlands east indiesedit following the outbreak of the war with japan 51 hurricane mk iibs were disassembled and sent in crates to singapore these and the 24 pilots many of whom were veterans of the battle of britain who had been transferred to the theatre formed the nucleus of five squadrons they arrived on 3 january 1942 by which time the allied fighter squadrons in singapore flying brewster buffalos had been overwhelmed during the malayan campaign the imperial japanese army air force's fighter force especially the nakajima ki-43 oscar had been underestimated in its capability numbers and the strategy of its commanders.117118 thanks to the efforts of the 151st maintenance unit the 51 hurricanes were assembled and ready for testing within 48 hours and of these 21 were ready for operational service within three days the hurricanes were fitted with bulky 'vokes dust filters under the nose and were armed with 12 rather than eight machine guns the additional weight and drag made them slow to climb and unwieldy to manoeuvre at altitude although they were more effective bomber killers.119 because of inadequate early warning systems the first british radar stations became operational only towards the end of february japanese air raids were able to destroy 30 hurricanes on the ground in sumatra most of them in one raid on 7 february after japanese landings in singapore on 10 february the remnants of 232 and 488 squadrons were withdrawn to palembang however japanese paratroopers began the invasion of sumatra on 13 february hurricanes destroyed six japanese transport ships on 14 february but lost seven aircraft in the process on 18 february the remaining allied aircraft and aircrews moved to java by this time only 18 serviceable hurricanes remained out of the original 99.121 that same month 12 hurricane mk iib trops were supplied to the dutch forces on java with dust filters removed and fuel and ammo load in wings halved these were able to stay in a turn with the oscars they fought.122 after java was invaded some of the new zealand pilots were evacuated by sea to australia one aircraft which had not been assembled was transferred to the raaf becoming the only hurricane to see service in australia in training and other non-combat units on 5 april 1942 captain mitsuo fuchida of the imperial japanese navy who led the attack on pearl harbor led a strike against colombo with 53 nakajima b5n torpedo bombers and 38 aichi d3a dive bombers escorted by 36 mitsubishi a6m zero fighters.124 they were opposed by 35 hurricane i and iibs of 30 and 258 squadrons together with six fairey fulmars of 803 and 806 squadrons of the fleet air arm.125 the hurricanes mainly tried to shoot down the attacking bombers but were engaged heavily by the escorting zeros.126 a total of 21 hurricanes were shot down although two of these were repairable127 together with four fulmars128 and six swordfish of 788 naval air squadron that had been surprised in flight by the raid.129 the raf claimed 18 japanese aircraft destroyed seven probably destroyed and nine damaged with one aircraft claimed by a fulmar and five by anti-aircraft fire this compared with actual japanese losses of one zero and six d3as with a further seven d3as five b5ns and three zeros damaged.126130 on 9 april 1942 the japanese task force sent 91 b5ns escorted by 41 zeros against trincomalee port and the nearby china bay airfield.131 a total of 16 hurricanes opposed the raid of which eight were lost with a further three damaged.132 they claimed eight japanese aircraft destroyed with a further four probably destroyed and at least five damaged actual japanese losses were three a6ms and two b5ns with a further 10 b5ns damaged.133 epilogueedit the battles over the arakan in 1943 represented the last large-scale use of the hurricane as a pure day fighter but they were still used in the fighter-bomber role in burma until the end of the war and they were occasionally caught up in air combat as well for example on 15 february 1944 flg off jagadish chandra verma of no 6 sqdn of the royal indian air force shot down a japanese ki-43 oscar it was the only riaf victory of the war.134 the hurricane remained in service as a fighter-bomber over the balkans and at home as well where it was used mainly for second-line tasks and occasionally flown by ace pilots for example in mid-1944 ace sqdn leader 'jas storrar flew no 1687 hurricane to deliver priority mail to allied armies in france during the normandy invasion.134 aircraft carrier operationsedit hurricane acesedit variantsedit operatorsedit due to its lightweight yet robust construction and ease of maintenance the hurricane had a long operational life in many theatres of war it was also built by or exported to several other countries the hurricane was unusual in that it was flown operationally by both the allies and the axis during the war in some cases e.g portugal and ireland the hurricane was pressed into service after being forced to land in a neutral country in 1939 latvia ordered 30 hurricane fighters and paid for them however due to the start of the second world war in september 1939 the aircraft were never delivered.154

space environment space environment is a branch of astronautics aerospace engineering and space physics that seeks to understand and address conditions existing in space that affect the design and operation of spacecraft a related subject space weather deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft but that can also affect the atmosphere ionosphere and geomagnetic field giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies effects on spacecraft can arise from radiation space debris and meteoroid impact upper atmospheric drag and spacecraft electrostatic charging spacecraft electrostatic charging is caused by the hot plasma environment around the earth the plasma encountered in the region of the geostationary orbit becomes heated during geomagnetic substorms caused by disturbances in the solar wind hot electrons with energies in the kilo-electron volt range collect on surfaces of spacecraft and can establish electrostatic potentials of the order of kilovolts as a result discharges can occur and are known to be the source of many spacecraft anomalies solutions devised by scientists and engineers include but are not limited to spacecraft shielding special hardening of electronic systems various collision detection systems evaluation of effects during spacecraft design includes application of various models of the environment including radiation belt models spacecraft-plasma interaction models and atmospheric models to predict drag effects encountered in lower orbits and during reentery the field often overlaps with the disciplines of astrophysics atmospheric science space physics and geophysics albeit usually with an emphasis on application the united states government maintains a space weather prediction center at boulder colorado the space weather prediction center swpc is part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa swpc is one of the national weather service's nws national centers for environmental prediction ncep space weather effects on earth can include ionospheric storms temporary decreases in ozone densities disruption to radio communication to gps signals and submarine positioning some scientists also theorize links between sunspot activity and ice ages 1 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

long march rocket family  contents  historyedit china launched its first satellite known as dong fang hong 1 lit the east is red 1 into earth orbit on its long march space rocket on april 24 1970 becoming the fifth nation to achieve independent launch capability early launches had an inconsistent record focusing on launching of chinese satellites starting in 1990 the long march rocket entered the international market however several setbacks occurred during the early 1990s on january 26 1995 a long march 2e rocket veered off course two seconds after take-off from xichang space center and exploded killing at least six on the ground.citation needed on february 14 1996 a similar failure occurred during the launch of intelsat 708 the rocket veered severely off course immediately after clearing the launch tower and crashed into a village.1 following the disaster foreign media were sequestered in a bunker for five hours while some have alleged the chinese military attempted to 'clean up the damagecitation needed officials later blamed the failure on an unexpected gust of wind2 xinhua news agency initially reported 6 deaths and 57 injuries.3 in the aftermath of the explosion u.s satellite makers shared information that allowed the chinese to determine that the problem was in the welds.4 this sharing of information was later deemed illegal by the united states and u.s satellite maker loral space and communications was fined $14 million by the u.s government.5 for thirteen years starting in august 1996 75 consecutive successful launches were conducted including multiple milestones the string of successful launches ended on august 31 2009 when the launch of palapa-d partially failed due to a third stage malfunction.6 on the june 11 2013 a long march 2f launched from the jiuquan satellite launch center putting three astronauts into orbit for the shenzhou 10 mission.7 as of march 2016update there have been 225 long march missions.8 payloadsedit propellantsedit long march 1's 1st and 2nd stage uses nitric acid and udmh propellants and its upper stage uses a spin-stabilized solid rocket engine long march 2 long march 3 long march 4 the main stages and associated liquid rocket boosters use dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizing agent and udmh as the fuel the upper stages third stage of long march 3 rockets use yf-73 and yf-75 engines using liquid hydrogen lh2 as the fuel and liquid oxygen lox as the oxidizer the new generation of long march rocket family long march 5 and its derivations long march 6 long march 7 will use lox and kerosene as core stage and liquid booster propellant with lox and lh2 in upper stages variantsedit the long march rockets are organized into several series note:there is no long march 10 strap-on boosters long march 8edit a new series of launch vehicles in study which is geared towards sso launches.18 long march 9edit long march 11edit the long march 11 is a solid-fuel rocket that applies china's largest solid-fuel rocket engine and was designed to meet the need to rapidly launch satellites in case of emergencies or disasters its first launch on 25 september 2015 was reported to be successful and launched 4 micro satellites into sun-synchronous orbits.2122 originsedit the long march 1 rocket is derived from earlier chinese 2-stage irbm df-4 or dong feng 4 missile and long march 2 long march 3 long march 4 rocket families are derivatives of the chinese 2-stage icbms df-5 or dong feng 5 missile however like its counterparts in both the united states and in russia the differing needs of space rockets and strategic missiles have caused the development of space rockets and missiles to diverge the main goal of a space rocket is to maximize payload while for strategic missiles increased throw weight is much less important than the ability to launch quickly and to survive a first strike this divergence has become clear in the next generation of long march rockets which use cryogenic propellants in sharp contrast to the next generation of strategic missiles which are mobile and solid fuelled the next generation of long march rocket long march 5 rocket family will be a brand new design while long march 6 and long march 7 can be seen as derivations because they use the liquid rocket booster design of long march 5 to build small-to-mid capacity launch vehicles launch sitesedit there are four launch centers in china they are most of the commercial satellite launches of long march vehicles have been from xichang satellite launch center located in xichang sichuan province wenchang satellite launch center in hainan province is under expansion and will be the main launch center for future commercial satellite launches long march launches also take place from the more military oriented jiuquan satellite launch center in gansu province from which the manned shenzhou spacecraft also launches taiyuan satellite launch center is located in shanxi province and focuses on the launches of sun-synchronous orbit satellites commercial launch servicesedit china markets launch services under the china great wall industry corporation.23 its efforts to launch communications satellites were dealt a blow in the mid-1990s after the united states stopped issuing export licenses to companies to allow them to launch on chinese launch vehicles out of fear that this would help china's military in the face of this thales alenia space built the chinasat-6b satellite with no components from the united states whatsoever this allowed it to be launched on a chinese launch vehicle without violating u.s itar restrictions.24 the launch on a long march 3b rocket was successfully conducted on july 5 2007 a chinese long march 2d launched venezuela's vrss-1

proprietor of the then-maryland colonial grant.1112 maryland was the seventh state to ratify the united states constitution and played a pivotal role in the founding of washington d.c. which was established on land donated by the state maryland is one of the smallest u.s states in terms of area as well as one of the most densely populated with around six million residents as of 2009update maryland had the highest median household income of any state owing in large part to its close proximity to the nation's capital and a highly diversified economy spanning manufacturing services and biotechnology.14  contents  geographyedit descriptionedit maryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders contributing to its nickname america in miniature it ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the chesapeake bay to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the piedmont region and pine groves in the maryland mountains to the west maryland is bounded on its north by pennsylvania on its west by west virginia on its east by delaware and the atlantic ocean and on its south across the potomac river by west virginia and virginia the mid-portion of this border is interrupted by washington d.c. which sits on land that was originally part of montgomery and prince george's counties and including the town of georgetown maryland this land was ceded to the united states federal government in 1790 to form the district of columbia the commonwealth of virginia gave land south of the potomac including the town of alexandria virginia however virginia retroceded its portion in 1846 the chesapeake bay nearly bisects the state and the counties east of the bay are known collectively as the eastern shore most of the state's waterways are part of the chesapeake bay watershed with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western garrett county drained by the youghiogheny river as part of the watershed of the mississippi river the eastern half of worcester county which drains into maryland's atlantic coastal bays and a small portion of the state's northeast corner which drains into the delaware river watershed so prominent is the chesapeake in maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the bay state a nickname that has been used by massachusetts for decades geologyedit earthquakes in maryland are infrequent and small due to the state's distance from seismic/earthquake zones.1718 the m5.8 virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout maryland buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage easily.citation needed the lack of any glacial history accounts for the scarcity of maryland's natural lakes yet the oft-repeated claim19 that maryland is the only state without natural lakes is not true laurel oxbow lake is an over one-hundred-year-old 55-acre natural lake two miles north of maryland city202122 and adjacent to russett chews lake is a seven-acre natural lake two miles south-southeast of upper marlboro.23 there are numerous man-made lakes the largest of them being the deep creek lake a reservoir in garrett county in westernmost maryland maryland has shale formations containing natural gas where fracking is theoretically possible.24 floraedit middle atlantic coastal forests typical of the southeastern atlantic coastal plain grow around chesapeake bay and on the delmarva peninsula moving west a mixture of northeastern coastal forests and southeastern mixed forests cover the central part of the state the appalachian mountains of western maryland are home to appalachian-blue ridge forests these give way to appalachian mixed mesophytic forests near the west virginia border.26 many foreign species are cultivated in the state some as ornamentals others as novelty species included among these are the crape myrtle italian cypress southern magnolia live oak in the warmer parts of the state27 and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state.28 usda plant hardiness zones in the state range from zones 5 and 6 in the extreme western part of the state to zone 7 in the central part and zone 8 around the southern part of the coast the bay area and parts of metropolitan baltimore.29 invasive plant species such as kudzu tree of heaven multiflora rose and japanese stiltgrass stifle growth of endemic plant life.30 maryland's state flower the black-eyed susan grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state the state insect the baltimore checkerspot butterfly is not common as it is near the southern edge of its range.31 435 species of birds have been reported from maryland.32 faunaedit the state harbors a great number of white tailed deer especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state and overpopulation can become a problem from year to year mammals can be found ranging from the mountains in the west to the central areas and include black bears33 bobcats34 foxes coyotes35 raccoons and otters.33 there is a population of rare wild feral horses found on assateague island.36 they are believed to be descended from horses who escaped from shipwrecks.36 every year during the last week of july they are captured and waded across a shallow bay for sale at chincoteague virginia a conservation technique which ensures the tiny island is not overrun by the horses.36 the ponies and their sale were popularized by the children's book misty of chincoteague the purebred chesapeake bay retriever dog was bred specifically for water sports hunting and search and rescue in the chesapeake area.37 in 1878 the chesapeake bay retriever was the first individual retriever breed recognized by the american kennel club.37 and was later adopted by the university of maryland baltimore county as their mascot maryland's reptile and amphibian

official state bird and mascot of the mlb team the baltimore orioles.38 environmentedit maryland joined with neighboring states during the end of the 20th century to improve the health of the chesapeake bay the bay's aquatic life and seafood industry have been threatened by development and by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay.3940 climateedit maryland has a wide array of climates due to local variances in elevation proximity to water and protection from colder weather due to downslope winds precipitationedit hurricanes and tornadoesedit adjacent statesedit historyedit 17th centuryedit maryland's first colonial settlementedit persecution of catholicsedit in 1646 leonard calvert returned with troops recaptured st mary's city and restored order the house of delegates passed the act concerning religion in 1649 granting religious liberty to all trinitarian christians.59 in 1650 the puritans revolted against the proprietary government protestants swept the catholics out of the legislature ...and religious strife returned.59 the puritans set up a new government prohibiting both roman catholicism and anglicanism the puritan revolutionary government persecuted maryland catholics during its reign known as the plundering time mobs burned down all the original catholic churches of southern maryland the puritan rule lasted until 1658 when the calvert family and lord baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the toleration act the royal charter granted maryland the land north of the potomac river up to the 40th parallel a problem arose when charles ii granted a charter for pennsylvania the grant defined pennsylvania's southern border as identical to maryland's northern border the 40th parallel but the grant indicated that charles ii and william penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to new castle delaware when it falls north of philadelphia the site of which penn had already selected for his colony's capital city negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681 the border dispute with pennsylvania led to cresap's war in the 1730s hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade culminating in the deployment of military forces by maryland in 1736 and by pennsylvania in 1737 the armed phase of the conflict ended in may 1738 with the intervention of king george ii who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire a provisional agreement had been established in 1732.63 18th centuryedit most of the english colonists arrived in maryland as indentured servants and had to serve a several years term as laborers to pay for their passage.64 in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together and formed unions mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem by which children took the social status of their mothers a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies following virginia in 1662 during the colonial era families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and african men.65 many of the free black families migrated to delaware where land was cheaper.65 as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england planters in maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened the economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor devoted first to the production of tobacco as the commodity crop maryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution on february 2 1781 maryland became the 13th state to approve the ratification of the articles of confederation which brought into being the united states as a united sovereign and national state it also became the seventh state admitted to the u.s after ratifying the new constitution in december 1790 maryland donated land selected by president george washington to the federal government for the creation of the new national capital of washington d.c the land was provided from montgomery and prince george's counties as well as from fairfax county and alexandria in virginia however the land donated by virginia was later returned to that state by the district of columbia retrocession 19th centuryedit influenced by a changing economy revolutionary ideals and preaching by ministers numerous planters in maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the revolutionary war across the upper south the free black population increased from less than 1 before the war to 14 by 1810.66 during the war of 1812 the british military attempted to capture

hwy 40 today was authorized in 1817 and ran from baltimore to st louis  the first federal highway the baltimore and ohio railroad b&o was the first chartered railroad in the united states it opened its first section of track for regular operation in 1830 between baltimore and ellicott city67 and in 1852 it became the first rail line to reach the ohio river from the eastern seaboard.68 civil waredit the state remained with the union during the civil war69 due in significant part to demographics and federal intervention by 1860 49 of maryland's african americans were free blacks.66 governor thomas holliday hicks suspended the state legislature and to help ensure the election of a new pro-union governor and legislature president abraham lincoln had a number of its pro-slavery politicians arrested including the mayor of baltimore george william brown suspended several civil liberties including habeas corpus and ordered artillery placed on federal hill overlooking baltimore historians debate the constitutionality of these wartime actions and the suspension of civil liberties was later deemed illegal by the u.s supreme court.citation needed in april 1861 federal units and state regiments were attacked as they marched through baltimore sparking the baltimore riot of 1861 the first bloodshed in the civil war.70 of the 115000 men from maryland who joined the military during the civil war 85000 or 77% joined the union army while the remainder joined the confederate army.citation needed the largest and most significant battle in the state was the battle of antietam on september 17 1862 near sharpsburg although a tactical draw the battle was considered a strategic union victory and a turning point of the war after the waredit a new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to freedmen in 1867 the state extended suffrage to non-white males compared to some other states blacks were better established both before and after the civil war nearly half the population was free before the war and some had accumulated property half the population lived in cities literacy was high among blacks and as democrats crafted means to exclude them suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist.71 whites did impose racial segregation in public facilities and jim crow laws which effectively lasted until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s baltimore grew significantly during the industrial revolution due in large part to its seaport and good railroad connections attracting european immigrant labor many manufacturing businesses were established in the baltimore area after the civil war baltimore businessmen including johns hopkins enoch pratt george peabody and henry walters founded notable city institutions that bear their names including a university library music school and art museum cumberland was maryland's second-largest city in the 19th century nearby supplies of natural resources along with railroads fostered its growth into a major manufacturing center.72 20th centuryedit early 20th centuryedit the progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms in a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908 reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots rather than those distributed and marked by the parties obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from assisting voters initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates and had candidates listed without party symbols which discouraged the illiterate from participating these measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks blacks resisted such efforts with suffrage groups conducting voter education blacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them making alliances with immigrants to resist various democratic campaigns.71 disfranchising bills in 1905 1907 and 1911 were rebuffed in large part because of black opposition blacks comprised 20 of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15% and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants.71 the progressive era also brought reforms in working conditions for maryland's labor force in 1902 the state regulated conditions in mines outlawed child laborers under the age of 12 mandated compulsory school attendance and enacted the nation's first workers compensation law the workers compensation law was overturned in the courts but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910 the great baltimore fire of 1904 burned over 30 hours destroying 1526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks more than 1231 firefighters worked to bring the blaze under control with the nation's entry into world war i in 1917 new military bases such as camp meade the aberdeen proving ground and the edgewood arsenal were established existing facilities including fort mchenry were greatly expanded maryland's urban and rural communities had different experiences during the great depression the bonus army marched through the state in 1932 on its way to washington d.c maryland instituted its first ever income tax in 1937 to generate revenue for schools and welfare.73 baltimore was a major war production center during world war ii the biggest operations were bethlehem steel's fairfield yard which built liberty ships and glenn martin an aircraft manufacturer maryland experienced population growth following world war ii particularly in the baltimore and washington d.c suburbs agricultural tracts gave way to residential communities such as columbia and montgomery village concurrently the interstate highway system was built throughout the state most notably i-95 and the capital beltway altering travel patterns in 1952 the eastern and western halves of maryland were linked for the first time by the chesapeake bay bridge which replaced a nearby ferry service.74 maryland's regions experienced economic changes following wwii heavy manufacturing declined in baltimore in maryland's four westernmost counties industrial railroad and coal mining jobs declined on the lower eastern shore family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent in southern maryland tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out program in an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries baltimore initiated urban renewal projects in the 1960s with charles center and the baltimore world trade center some resulted in the break-up of intact residential neighborhoods producing social volatility and some older residential areas around the harbor have had units renovated and have become popular with new populations demographicsedit the united states census bureau estimates that the population of maryland was 6006401 on july 1 2015 a

of maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding washington d.c. as well as in and around maryland's most populous city baltimore historically these and many other maryland cities developed along the fall line the line along which rivers brooks and streams are interrupted by rapids and/or waterfalls maryland's capital city annapolis is one exception to this pattern since it lies along the banks of the severn river close to where it empties into the chesapeake bay the eastern shore is less populous and more rural as are the counties of western maryland the two westernmost counties of maryland allegany and garrett are mountainous and sparsely populated resembling west virginia and appalachia more than they do the rest of maryland both eastern and western maryland are however dotted with cities of regional importance such as ocean city princess anne and salisbury on the eastern shore and cumberland frostburg and hancock in western maryland

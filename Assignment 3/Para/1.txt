tropical cyclone though their effects on human populations are often devastating tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions they also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes which may play an important role in modulating regional and global climate contents physical structure tropical cyclones are areas of relatively low pressure in the troposphere with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface on earth the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level.7 the environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes thus they are characterized as warm core systems.8 wind field the previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly axisymmetric wind speeds are low at the center increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds and then decay more gradually with radius to large radii however the wind field often exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes such as thunderstorm activity and horizontal flow instabilities in the vertical direction winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height within the troposphere.11 eye and center the cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the eyewall the eyewall typically expands outward with height resembling an arena football stadium this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect.14 the eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found air rises most rapidly clouds reach to their highest altitude and precipitation is the heaviest the heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.12 in a weaker storm the eye may be obscured by the central dense overcast which is the upper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone.15 the eyewall may vary over time in the form of eyewall replacement cycles particularly in intense tropical cyclones outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum when the primary eyewall weakens the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily the outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.16 rapid deepening size size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm all else equal a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time additionally a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch longer duration and enhanced wave setup.23 physics and energetics the three-dimensional wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components a primary circulation and a secondary circulation the primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow it is purely circular the secondary circulation is the overturning in-up-out-down part of the flow it is in the radial and vertical directions the primary circulation is larger in magnitude dominating the surface wind field and is responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the energetics of the storm secondary circulation a carnot heat engine a tropical cyclone's primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of water from the ocean surface which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation the energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric carnot heat engine.26 first inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water i.e latent heat at the temperature of the warm ocean surface during evaporation the ocean cools and the air warms second the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation third air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause finally air subsides and warms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content the first and third legs are nearly isothermal while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic this in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation the carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain primary circulation rotating winds the primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the conservation of angular momentum by the secondary circulation absolute angular momentum on a rotating planetmdisplaystyle m is given by wherefdisplaystyle f is the coriolis parametervdisplaystyle v is the azimuthal i.e rotating wind speed andrdisplaystyle r is the radius to the axis of rotation the first term on the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local vertical i.e the axis of rotation the second term on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the axis of rotation because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the equator wheref0displaystyle f=0  tropical cyclones rarely form within 5 of the equator.629 as air flows radially inward at low levels it begins to rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum similarly as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone the result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause from thermal wind balance this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes i.e warm-core from hydrostatic balance the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.11 maximum potential intensity due to surface friction the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum thus the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source evaporation and sink friction of energy for the system this fact leads to the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the wind-induced surface heat exchange wishe feedback.26 this feedback is offset when frictional dissipation which increases with the cube of the wind speed becomes sufficiently large this upper bound is called the maximum potential intensityvpdisplaystyle v_p and is given by derivation a tropical cyclone may be viewed as a heat engine that converts input heat energy from the surface into mechanical

with the upper ocean the passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially which can influence subsequent cyclone development this cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters this effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage all these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.38 major basins and related warning centers there are six regional specialized meteorological centers rsmcs worldwide these organizations are designated by the world meteorological organization and are responsible for tracking and issuing bulletins warnings and advisories about tropical cyclones in their designated areas of responsibility in addition there are six tropical cyclone warning centers tcwcs that provide information to smaller regions.44 the rsmcs and tcwcs are not the only organizations that provide information about tropical cyclones to the public the joint typhoon warning center jtwc issues advisories in all basins except the northern atlantic for the purposes of the united states government.45 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa issues advisories and names for tropical cyclones that approach the philippines in the northwestern pacific to protect the life and property of its citizens.46 the canadian hurricane center chc issues advisories on hurricanes and their remnants for canadian citizens when they affect canada.47 formation worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest however each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active month november is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active.49 times in the northern atlantic ocean a distinct cyclone season occurs from june 1 to november 30 sharply peaking from late august through september.49 the statistical peak of the atlantic hurricane season is september 10 the northeast pacific ocean has a broader period of activity but in a similar time frame to the atlantic.50 the northwest pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round with a minimum in february and march and a peak in early september.49 in the north indian basin storms are most common from april to december with peaks in may and november.49 in the southern hemisphere the tropical cyclone year begins on july 1 and runs all year-round encompassing the tropical cyclone seasons which run from november 1 until the end of april with peaks in mid-february to early march.4951  factors locations movement the movement of a tropical cyclone i.e its track is typically approximated as the sum of two terms steering by the background environmental wind and beta drift.71 environmental steering environmental steering is the dominant term conceptually it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions similar to leaves carried along by a stream.72 physically the winds or flow field in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts the flow associated with the storm itself and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place in this way tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as advection of the storm by the local environmental flow this environmental flow is termed the steering flow beta drift in addition to environmental steering a tropical cyclone will tend to drift slowly poleward and westward a motion known as beta drift this motion is due to the superposition of a vortex such as a tropical cyclone onto an environment in which the coriolis force varies with latitude such as on a sphere or beta plane it is induced indirectly by the storm itself the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environment physically the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center because air must conserve its angular momentum this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center the combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward this effect occurs even if there is zero environmental flow multiple storm interaction a third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the interaction of multiple tropical cyclones when two cyclones approach one another their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems depending on their separation distance and strength the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge when the two vortices are of unequal size the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction and the smaller vortex will orbit around it this phenomenon is called the fujiwhara effect after sakuhei fujiwhara.74 interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies though a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics its track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow such as the jet stream or an extratropical cyclone this motion termed recurvature commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean basins where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical cyclones are common.75 an example of tropical cyclone recurvature was typhoon ioke in 2006.76 landfall the landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm's surface center moves over a coastline.9 storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall in fact a tropical cyclone can launch its strongest winds over land yet not make landfall noaa uses the term direct hit to describe when a location on the left side of the eye falls within the radius of maximum winds or twice that radius if on the right side whether or not the hurricane's eye made landfall.9 dissipation factors a tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways one such way is if it moves over land thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself quickly losing strength.77 most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two or evolve into extratropical cyclones there is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water such as with hurricane ivan if it remains over mountains for even a short time weakening will accelerate.78 many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall.79 this rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides as was the case with hurricane mitch around honduras in october 1998.80 without warm surface water the storm cannot survive.81 artificial dissipation other approaches have been suggested over time including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans.91 other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation92 dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop91 or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons.93 project cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone.94 these approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived for any of the weakening techniques to be practical.95 effects tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves heavy rain flood and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing shipwrecks.96 tropical cyclones stir up water leaving a cool wake behind them which causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones.38 on land strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths.97 the broad rotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone and vertical wind shear at its periphery spawns tornadoes tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices which persist until landfall.98 although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.101 tropical cyclones also help maintain the global heat balance by moving warm moist tropical air to the middle latitudes and polar regions102 and by regulating the thermohaline circulation through upwelling.103 the storm surge and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment greatly increasing local property values.104 when hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean salt is introduced to many freshwater areas and raises the salinity levels too high for some habitats to withstand some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the ocean but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it because of this some species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt.105 in addition hurricanes can carry toxins and acids onto shore when they make landfall the flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over the toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area as well as the environment around them the flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills.106 observation and forecasting observation intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon and weather stations being relatively sparse are rarely available on the site of the storm itself in general surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area or if there is a nearby ship real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated for this reason there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.107 tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals as a storm approaches land it can be observed by land-based doppler weather radar radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes.108 in situ measurements in real-time can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone in the atlantic basin these flights are regularly flown by united states government hurricane hunters.109 the aircraft used are wc-130 hercules and wp-3d orions both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft these aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements the aircraft also launch gps dropsondes inside the cyclone these sondes measure temperature humidity pressure and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface a new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted aerosonde a small drone aircraft was flown through tropical storm ophelia as it passed virginia's eastern shore during the 2005 hurricane season a similar mission was also completed successfully in the western pacific ocean this demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.110 forecasting classifications terminology and naming intensity classifications tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups based on intensity tropical depressions tropical storms and a third group of more intense storms whose name depends on the region for example if a tropical storm in the northwestern pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the beaufort scale it is referred to as a typhoon if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the northeast pacific basin or in the north atlantic it is called a hurricane.9 neither hurricane nor typhoon is used in either the southern hemisphere or the indian ocean in these basins storms of a tropical nature are referred to as either tropical cyclones severe tropical cyclones or very intense tropical cyclones tropical depression tropical storm hurricane or typhoon origin of storm terms naming the practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming.127128 the system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems in a brief form that is readily understood and recognized by the public.127128 the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907.127128 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific.127128 formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the north and south atlantic eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian ocean.128 notable tropical cyclones long-term activity trends often in part because of the threat of hurricanes many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism therefore the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances the combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes therefore experts regard the early data as suspect.160 these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the atlantic basin before the satellite era began in 1960 tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one a ship reported a voyage through the storm or a storm hit land in a populated area.160  climate change the 2007 ipcc report noted many observed changes in the climate including atmospheric composition global average temperatures ocean conditions and others the report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict in addition the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.168 according to 2006 studies by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.170 studies published since 2008 by kerry emanuel from mit indicate that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity.171 in an article in nature kerry emanuel stated that potential hurricane destructiveness a measure combining hurricane strength duration and frequency is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature reflecting well-documented climate signals including multidecadal oscillations in the north atlantic and north pacific and global warming emanuel predicted a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century.172 a 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods storm surge and terrestrial flooding rivers and projects an increase due to global warming.175176 related cyclone types in addition to tropical cyclones there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types these kinds of cyclones known as extratropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation.177 an extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences which are typical in higher latitudes a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses although not as frequently an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone.178 from space extratropical storms have a characteristic comma-shaped cloud pattern.179 extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high seas.180 popular culture in popular culture tropical cyclones have made several appearances in different types of media including films books television music and electronic games.183 these media often portray tropical cyclones that are either entirely fictional or based on real events.183 for example george rippey stewart's storm a best-seller published in 1941 is thought to have influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female names to pacific tropical cyclones.128 another example is the hurricane in the perfect storm which describes the sinking of the andrea gail by the 1991 perfect storm.184 hypothetical hurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such as the simpsons invasion family guy seinfeld dawson's creek burn notice and csi miami.183185186187188189 the 2004 film the day after tomorrow includes several mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features fantastical hurricane-like albeit non-tropical arctic storms.190191 see also forecasting and preparation annual seasons references external links regional specialized meteorological centers tropical cyclone warning centers reference  navigation menu

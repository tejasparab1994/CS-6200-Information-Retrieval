washington d.c washington d.c. formally the district of columbia and commonly referred to as washington the district or simply d.c. is the capital of the united states the signing of the residence act on july 16 1790 approved the creation of a capital district located along the potomac river on the country's east coast the u.s constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the congress and the district is therefore not a part of any state the states of maryland and virginia each donated land to form the federal district which included the pre-existing settlements of georgetown and alexandria named in honor of president george washington the city of washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital in 1846 congress returned the land originally ceded by virginia in 1871 it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district all three branches of the federal government of the united states are centered in the district  the congress president and supreme court washington is home to many national monuments and museums which are primarily situated on or around the national mall the city hosts 176 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many international organizations trade unions non-profit organizations lobbying groups and professional associations  contents  history various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people also known as the conoy inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century one group known as the nacotchtank also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present-day district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks maryland.5 in his federalist no 43 published january 23 1788 james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.6 five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.7 foundation a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9 1791 the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time.1516 congress held its first session in washington on november 17 1800.17 congress passed the organic act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west.18 after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in congress.19 retrocession and the civil war in the 1830s the district's southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress.22 the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy alexandria's citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession.23 the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9 1846 congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the district's current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland.22 confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itself.24 the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the district's population including a large influx of freed slaves.25 president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862 which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation.26 in 1868 congress granted the district's african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.25 growth and redevelopment by 1870 the district's population had grown 75 from the previous census to nearly 132000 residents.27 despite the city's growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposal.28 congress passed the organic act of 1871 which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia.29 president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873 shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874 congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners.30 the city's first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washington's original boundaries washington's urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades.31 georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 1895.32 however the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the city beautiful movement in the early 1900s.33 increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings memorials and museums in washington.34 world war ii further increased government activity adding to the number of federal employees in the capital;35 by 1950 the district's population reached its peak of 802178 residents.27 civil rights and home rule era the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961 granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president but still no voting representation in congress.36 in 1973 congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district.38 in 1975 walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district.39 on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked american airlines flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into the pentagon in nearby arlington virginia united airlines flight 93 believed to be destined for washington d.c. crashed in pennsylvania when passengers tried to recover control of the plane from hijackers.4041 geography the south bank of the potomac river forms the district's border with virginia and has two major tributaries the anacostia river and rock creek.44 tiber creek a natural watercourse that once passed through the national mall was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.45 the creek also formed a portion of the now-filled washington city canal which allowed passage through the city to the anacostia river from 1815 until the 1850s.46 the chesapeake and ohio canal starts in georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the little falls of the potomac river located at the northwest edge of washington at the atlantic seaboard fall line.47 climate hurricanes or their remnants occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall but are often weak by the time they reach washington partly due to the city's inland location.68 flooding of the potomac river however caused by a combination of high tide storm surge and runoff has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of georgetown.69 precipitation occurs throughout the year.70  cityscape president washington dismissed l'enfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction andrew ellicott who had worked with l'enfant surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns l'enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.79 by the early 1900s l'enfant's vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washington's ceremonial core.33 what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved l'enfant's intended design.76 the city of washington was bordered by boundary street to the north renamed florida avenue in 1890 rock creek to the west and the anacostia river to the east.3176 washington's street grid was extended where possible throughout the district starting in 1888.82 georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895.32 some streets are particularly noteworthy such as pennsylvania avenue which connects the white house to the capitol and k street which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.83 washington hosts 177 foreign embassies constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1600 residential properties owned by foreign countries many of which are on a section of massachusetts avenue informally known as embassy row.84 architecture the architecture of washington varies greatly six of the top 10 buildings in the american institute of architects 2007 ranking of america's favorite architecture are in the district of columbia:85 the white house the washington national cathedral the thomas jefferson memorial the united states capitol the lincoln memorial and the vietnam veterans memorial the neoclassical georgian gothic and modern architectural styles are all reflected among those six structures and many other prominent edifices in washington notable exceptions include buildings constructed in the french second empire style such as the eisenhower executive office building.86 demographics the u.s census bureau estimates that the district's population was 681170 on july 1 2016 an 13.2 increase since the 2010 united states census.3 the increase continues a growth trend since 2000 following a half-century of population decline.93 the city was the 24th most populous place in the united states as of 2010update.94 according to data from 2010 commuters from the suburbs increase the district's daytime population to over one million people.95 if the district were a state it

population between 1800 and 1940.27 the black population reached a peak of 70 by 1970 but has since steadily declined due to many african americans moving to the surrounding suburbs partly as a result of gentrification there was a 31.4 increase in the non-hispanic white population and an 11.5 decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.99 about 17 of d.c residents were age 18 or younger in 2010 lower than the u.s average of 24% however at 34 years old the district had the lowest median age compared to the 50 states.100 as of 2010update there were an estimated 81734 immigrants living

same-sex couples in march 2010.104 a 2007 report found that about one-third of district residents were functionally illiterate compared to a national rate of about one in five this is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in english.105 as of 2011update 85 of d.c residents age 5 and older spoke english at home as a primary language.106 half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006.101 d.c residents had a personal income per capita of $55755 higher than any of the 50 states.107 however 19 of residents were below the poverty level in 2005 higher than any

the nation this is due in part to city programs that help provide insurance to low-income individuals who do not qualify for other types of coverage.110 a 2009 report found that at least 3 of district residents have hiv or aids which the centers for disease control and prevention cdc characterizes as a generalized and severe epidemic.111 crime crime in washington d.c. is concentrated in areas associated with poverty drug abuse and gangs a 2010 study found that 5 of city blocks accounted for over one-quarter of the district's total crime.112 the more affluent neighborhoods of northwest washington are typically safe but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city.112 approximately 60000 residents are ex-convicts.113 washington was often described as the murder capital of the united states during the early 1990s.114 the number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479 but the level of violence then began to decline significantly.115 by 2012 washington's annual murder count had dropped to 88 the lowest total since 1961.116 the murder rate has since risen from that historic low though it remains close to half the rate of the early 2000s.117 in 2016 the district's metropolitan police department tallied 135 homicides a 53 increase from 2012 but a 17 decrease from 2015.118 many neighborhoods such as columbia heights and logan circle are becoming safer and vibrant however incidents of robberies and thefts have remained higher in these areas because of increased nightlife activity and greater numbers of affluent residents.119 even still citywide reports of both property and violent crimes have declined by nearly half since their most recent highs in the mid-1990s.120 on june 26 2008 the supreme court of the united states held in district of columbia v heller that the city's 1976 handgun ban violated the right to keep and bear arms as protected under the second amendment.121 however the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control laws requiring firearm registration remain in place as does the city's assault weapon ban.122 in addition to the district's own metropolitan police department many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well most visibly the u.s park police founded in 1791.123 economy in 2012 the federal government accounted for about 29 of the jobs in washington d.c.130 this is thought to immunize washington to national economic downturns because the federal government continues operations even during recessions.131 many organizations such as law firms independent contractors both defense and civilian non-profit organizations lobbying firms trade unions industry trade groups and professional associations have their headquarters in or near d.c to be close to the federal government.83 the district has growing industries not directly related to government especially in the areas of education finance public policy

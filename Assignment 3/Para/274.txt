turboprop a turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller.1 in contrast to a turbojet the engine's exhaust gases do not contain enough energy to create significant thrust since almost all of the engine's power is used to drive the propeller in its simplest form a turboprop consists of an intake compressor combustor turbine and a propelling nozzle air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor where the fuel-air mixture then combusts the hot combustion gases expand through the turbine some of the power generated by the turbine is used to drive the compressor the rest is transmitted through the reduction gearing to the propeller further expansion of the gases occurs in the propelling nozzle where the gases exhaust to atmospheric pressure the propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust generated by a turboprop  contents  technological aspectsedit exhaust thrust in a turboprop is sacrificed in favor of shaft power which is obtained by extracting additional power up to that necessary to drive the compressor from turbine expansion owing to the additional expansion in the turbine system the residual energy in the exhaust jet is low.234 consequently the exhaust jet typically produces around or less than 10 of the total thrust.5 a higher proportion of the thrust comes from the propeller at low speeds and less at higher speeds.6 turboprops can have bypass ratios up to 50-100789 although the propulsion airflow is less clearly defined for propellers than for fans.10 the propeller is coupled to the turbine through a reduction gear that converts the high rpm/low torque output to low rpm/high torque the propeller itself is normally a constant speed variable pitch type similar to that used with larger reciprocating aircraft engines.citation needed unlike the small diameter fans used in turbofan jet engines the propeller has a large diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air this permits a lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust as it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate a large amount of air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree1112 a low disc loading thrust per disc area increases the aircraft's energy efficiency and this reduces the fuel use.1314 propellers lose efficiency as aircraft speed increases so turboprops are normally not used on high-speed aircraft234 above mach 0.6-0.7.5 however propfan engines which are very similar to turboprop engines can cruise at flight speeds approaching mach 0.75 to increase propeller efficiency a mechanism can be used to alter their pitch relative to the airspeed a variable-pitch propeller also called a controllable-pitch propeller can also be used to generate negative thrust while decelerating on the runway additionally in the event of an engine outage the pitch can be adjusted to a vaning pitch called feathering thus minimizing the drag of the non-functioning propeller.citation needed while most modern turbojet and turbofan engines use axial-flow compressors turboprop engines usually contain at least one stage of centrifugal compression centrifugal compressors have the advantage of being simple and lightweight at the expense of a streamlined shape.citation needed historyedit alan arnold griffith had published a paper on turbine design in 1926 subsequent work at the royal aircraft establishment investigated axial turbine designs that could be used to supply power to a shaft and thence a propeller from 1929 frank whittle began work on centrifugal turbine designs that would deliver pure jet thrust.16 the first american turboprop engine was the general electric xt31 first used in the experimental consolidated vultee xp-81.26 the xp-81 first flew in december 1945 the first aircraft to use a combination of turboprop and turbojet power the technology of the allison's earlier t38 design evolved into the allison t56 with quartets of the t56s being used to power the lockheed electra airliner its military maritime patrol derivative the p-3 orion and the widely produced c-130 hercules military transport aircraft one of the most produced turboprop engines used in civil aviation is the pratt  whitney canada pt6 engine.citation needed the first turbine-powered shaft-driven helicopter was the kaman k-225 a development of charles kaman's k-125 synchropter which used a boeing t50 turboshaft engine to power it on 11 december 1951.27 usageedit the most common application of turboprop engines in civilian aviation is in small commuter aircraft where their greater power and reliability offsets their higher initial cost and fuel consumption turboprop-powered aircraft have become popular for bush airplanes such as the cessna caravan and quest kodiak as jet fuel is easier to obtain in remote areas than avgas.citation needed due to the high price of turboprop engines they are mostly used where high-performance short-takeoff and landing stol capability and efficiency at modest flight speeds are required some commercial aircraft with turboprop engines include the bombardier dash 8 atr

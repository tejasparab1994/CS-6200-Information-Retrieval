iceberg an iceberg or ice mountain is a large piece of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water.12 it may subsequently become frozen into pack ice one form of sea ice as it drifts into shallower waters it may come into contact with the seabed a process referred to as seabed gouging by ice also about 91 of an iceberg is below the surface of the water  contents  etymologyedit the word iceberg is a partial loan translation from the dutch word ijsberg literally meaning ice mountain3 cognate to danish isbjerg german eisberg low saxon iesbarg and swedish isberg overviewedit when a piece of iceberg ice melts a fizzing sound called the bergie seltzer is produced this sound is made when the water-ice interface reaches compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice as this happens each bubble bursts making a 'popping sound the bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice that eventually got buried to a given depth up to several kilometers and pressurized as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice.4 recent large icebergsedit shapeedit in addition to size classification icebergs can be classified on the basis of their shape the two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top much like a plateau with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5:1.13 this type of iceberg also known as an ice island14 can be quite large as in the case of pobeda ice island antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf such as the ross ice shelf or filchner-ronne ice shelf are typically tabular the largest icebergs in the world are formed this way non-tabular icebergs have different shapes and include:15 monitoringedit icebergs are monitored worldwide by the u.s national ice center nic established in 1995 which produces analyses and forecasts of arctic antarctic great lakes and chesapeake bay ice conditions more than 95 of the data used in its sea ice analyses are derived from the remote sensors on polar-orbiting satellites that survey these remote regions of the earth historyedit in the 20th century several scientific bodies were established to study and monitor the icebergs the international ice patrol formed in 1914 in response to the april 1912 sinking of the titanic which killed 1517 of its 2223 passengers and crew monitors iceberg dangers near the grand banks of newfoundland and provides the limits of all known ice in that vicinity to the maritime community technology historyedit before the early 1910s there was no system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions most likely because they weren't considered a serious threat ascitation needed ships had managed to survive even direct crashes in 1907 ss kronprinz wilhelm a german liner had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow but was still able to complete her voyage the april 1912 sinking of the titanic however changed all that and created the demand for a system to observe icebergs for the remainder of the ice season of that year the united states navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow in november 1913 the international conference on the safety of life at sea met in london to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the international ice patrol iip the goal of the iip was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents ice-flow ocean temperature and salinity levels they published their first records in 1921 which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement new technologies monitor icebergs aerial surveillance of the seas in the early 1930s allowed for the development of charter systems that could accurately detail the ocean currents and iceberg locations in 1945 experiments tested the effectiveness of radar in detecting icebergs a decade later oceanographic monitoring outposts were established for the purpose of collecting data these outposts continue to serve in environmental study a computer was first installed on a ship for the purpose of oceanographic monitoring in 1964 which allowed for a faster evaluation of data by the 1970s icebreaking ships were equipped with automatic transmissions of satellite photographs of ice in antarctica systems for optical satellites had been developed but were still limited by weather conditions in the 1980s drifting buoys were used in antarctic waters for oceanographic and climate research they are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currents side looking airborne radar slar made it possible to acquire images regardless of weather conditions on november 4 1995 canada launched radarsat-1 developed by the canadian space agency it provides images of earth for scientific and commercial purposes this system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar sar which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs the european space agency launched envisat an observation satellite that orbits the earth's poles20 on march 1 2002 envisat employs advanced synthetic aperture radar asar technology which can detect changes in surface height accurately the canadian space agency launched radarsat-2 in december 2007 which uses sar and multi-polarization modes and follows the same orbit path as radarsat-1.21 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

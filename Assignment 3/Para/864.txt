1938 new england hurricane  contents  meteorological historyedit forecasting the stormedit in 1938 united states forecasting lagged behind forecasting in europe where new techniques were being used to analyze air masses taking into account the influence of fronts a confidential report was released by the united states forest service the parent agency of the united states weather bureau it described the weather bureau's forecasting as a sorry state of affairs where forecasters had poor training and systematic planning was not used and where forecasters had to scrape by to get information wherever they could the jacksonville florida office of the weather bureau issued a warning on september 19 that a hurricane might hit florida residents and authorities made extensive preparations as they had endured the labor day hurricane three years earlier when the storm turned north the office issued warnings for the carolina coast and transferred authority to the bureau's headquarters in washington at 9:00 am on september 21 the washington office issued northeast storm warnings north of atlantic city and south of block island rhode island and southeast storm warnings from block island to eastport maine.12 the advisory however underestimated the storm's intensity and said that it was farther south than it actually was.12 the office had yet to forward any information about the hurricane to the new york city office.12 at 10:00 am the bureau downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm the 11:30 am advisory mentioned gale-force winds but nothing about a tropical storm or hurricane.12 that day 28 year-old rookie charles pierce was standing in for two veteran meteorologists he concluded that the storm would be squeezed between a high-pressure area located to the west and a high-pressure area to the east and that it would be forced to ride up a trough of low pressure into new england a noon meeting was called and pierce presented his conclusion but he was overruled by celebrated chief forecaster charles mitchell and his senior staff in boston meteorologist e.b rideout told his weei radio listeners to the skepticism of his peers that the hurricane would hit new england.13 at 2:00 pm hurricane-force gusts were occurring on long island's south shore and near hurricane-force gusts on the coast of connecticut the washington office issued an advisory saying that the storm was 75 miles east-southeast of atlantic city and would pass over long island and connecticut re-analysis of the storm suggests that the hurricane was farther north just 50 miles from fire island and that it was stronger and larger than the advisory said.12 impactedit approximately 600 people died in the storm in new england most in rhode island and up to 100 people elsewhere in the path of the storm.16 an additional 708 people were reported injured.17 in total 4500 cottages farms and other homes were reported destroyed and 25000 homes were damaged other damages included 26000 automobiles destroyed and 20000 electrical poles toppled the hurricane also devastated the forests of the northeast knocking down an estimated two billion trees in new york and new england.17 freshwater flooding was minimal however as the quick passage of the storm decreased local rainfall totals with only a few small areas receiving over 10 inches 250 mm yale and harvard both owned large forests managed by their forestry departments but both forests were wiped out by the hurricane however yale had a backup forest at great mountain in northwestern connecticut which was spared from the totality of the damages and they were able to keep their forestry program running which maintains operation today harvard's program however was reduced as a result.23 new jerseyedit new york city and western long islandedit in new york city and long island schools were dismissed early.1226 extensive street flooding occurred because debris blocked drains.12 the east river flowed three blocks and flooded a consolidated edison con ed plant at 133rd street causing power to fail in manhattan north of 59th street and in the bronx for several minutes to a few hours railroad and ferry services were suspended for a time the staten island ferry boat knickerbocker got stuck in the terminal with 200 passengers aboard.1225 bridges and tunnels into manhattan were closed until the following afternoon 95 of nassau county lost power where floods brought traffic to a halt.25 eastern long islandedit eastern long island experienced the worst of the storm the dune road area of westhampton beach was obliterated resulting in 29 deaths there were 21 other deaths through the rest of the east end of long island the storm surge temporarily turned montauk into an island as it flooded across the south fork at napeague and obliterated the tracks of the long island rail road long island was hit hard being exposed to the storm due to its shorelines the estimated storm tide was 15 feet in this region a mean low water storm tide of 8 feet was recorded at port jefferson.10 about 50 people perished in the storm's wake.20 all the shore lines were very vulnerable to the high winds and flooding and anyone near the shores was directly in harm's way ten new inlets were created on eastern long island.10 the surge rearranged the sand at the cedar point lighthouse so that the island became connected to what is now cedar point county park the surging water created the shinnecock inlet by carving out a large section of barrier island separating shinnecock bay from the atlantic the storm toppled the landmark steeple of the old whaler's church32 which was the tallest building in sag harbor the steeple has not been rebuilt wading river suffered substantial damage the storm blew down the movie theater on front street in greenport on the north fork of long island the fishing industry was destroyed as was half of the apple crop.10 rhode islandedit many homes and structures were destroyed along the coast as well as many structures inland along the hurricane's path entire beach communities were obliterated on the coast of rhode island napatree point was completely swept away a small cape that housed nearly 40 families between the atlantic ocean and little narragansett bay just off of watch hill today napatree is a wildlife refuge with no human inhabitants one house in charlestown rhode island was lifted and deposited across the street where it stood until it was demolished in august 2011 even to this day concrete staircases and boardwalk bases destroyed by the hurricane can be found when sand levels are low on some beaches the boardwalk along easton's beach in newport was completely destroyed by the storm.35 a few miles from conanicut island whale rock light was swept off its base and into the raging waves killing lighthouse keeper walter eberle his body was never found the prudence island light suffered a direct blow from the storm surge which measured 17 feet 5 inches at sandy point the masonry tower was slightly damaged however the adjoining light keeper's home was utterly destroyed and washed out to sea the light keeper's wife and son were both killed as well as the former light keeper and a couple who left their summer cottages near the lighthouse and sought shelter in what they thought was the sturdier light keeper's home light keeper george t gustavus was thrown free from the wreckage of the house and was saved by an island resident who held a branch into the water from the cliffs farther down the coast gustavus and milton chase the owner of the island's power plant reactivated the light during the storm by running a cable from the plant to the light and installing a light bulb marking the first time that it was illuminated with electricity.36 the original parchment of the 1764 charter of brown university was washed clean of its text when its vault was flooded in a providence bank.37 newport recorded the highest water level of the storm at 3.53 meters above mean sea level according to a noaa study.38 this storm level is 0.98 meters above the slosh model of a 100-year storm and one estimate is that this water level reflects a storm occurring roughly once every 400 years.39 a study of sand deposits also gives evidence that this was the strongest hurricane to hit rhode island in over 300 years.3839 the fox point hurricane barrier was completed in 1966 because of the massive flooding from the 1938 storm and from the even higher 14.4 foot 4.4 meters storm surge that resulted from 1954's hurricane carol in hopes of preventing extreme storm surges from ever again flooding downtown providence.40 connecticutedit eastern connecticut was on the eastern side of the hurricane long island acted as a buffer against large ocean surges but the waters of long island sound rose to great heights small shoreline towns to the east of new haven experienced much destruction from the water and winds and the 1938 hurricane holds the record for the worst natural disaster in connecticut's 350-year history the mean low-water storm tide was 14.1 feet at stamford 12.8 feet at bridgeport and 10.58 feet at new london which remains a record high.10 interior sections of the state experienced widespread flooding as the hurricane's torrential rains fell on soil already saturated from previous storms the connecticut river was forced out of its banks inundating cities and towns from hartford to middletown novelist ann petry drew on her personal experiences of the hurricane in old saybrook in her 1947 novel country place the novel is set in the immediate aftermath of world war ii but petry identified the 1938 storm as the source for the storm that is at the center of her narrative.citation needed massachusettsedit vermontedit new hampshireedit maineedit in maine buildings and trees were damaged and power outages occurred storm surge was minimal and winds remained below hurricane strength the storm did not claim any lives in maine.2945 maryland and delawareedit the western periphery of the hurricane brought heavy rain and gusty winds to delaware and southeastern maryland.46 damage if any is believed to have been minimal quebecedit as the hurricane was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone it tracked into southern quebec by the time the system initially crossed into canada it continued to produce heavy rain and very strong winds but interaction with land had taken its toll nevertheless the hurricane managed to blow down numerous trees throughout the region.47 otherwise damage was generally minimal.48 see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit bibliographyedit external linksedit  media related to new england hurricane of 1938 at wikimedia commons navigation menu personal tools

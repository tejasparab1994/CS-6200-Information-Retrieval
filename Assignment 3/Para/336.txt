mexico mexico has the fifteenth largest nominal gdp and the eleventh largest by purchasing power parity the mexican economy is strongly linked to those of its north american free trade agreement nafta partners especially the united states.1617 mexico was the first latin american member of the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd joining in 1994 it is classified as an upper-middle income country by the world bank18 and a newly industrialized country by several analysts.19202122 by 2050 mexico could become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.2324 the country is considered both a regional power and middle power25262728 and is often identified as an emerging global power.29 due to its rich culture and history mexico ranks first in the americas and seventh in the world by number of unesco world heritage sites.303132 mexico is a megadiverse country ranking fourth in the world by biodiversity in 2016 it was the eighth most visited country in the world with 35 million international arrivals.33 mexico is a member of the united nations the world trade organization the g8+5 the g20 the uniting for consensus and the pacific alliance  contents  etymology history pre-columbian mexico the earliest human artifacts in mexico are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the valley of mexico and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10000 years ago.42 mexico is the site of the domestication of maize tomato and beans which produced an agricultural surplus this enabled the transition from paleo-indian hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 bce.43 in the subsequent formative eras maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a mythological and religious complex and a vigesimal numeric system were diffused from the mexican cultures to the rest of the mesoamerican culture area.44 in this period villages became more dense in terms of population becoming socially stratified with an artisan class and developing into chiefdoms the most powerful rulers had religious and political power organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developed.45 the earliest complex civilization in mexico was the olmec culture which flourished on the gulf coast from around 1500 bce olmec cultural traits diffused through mexico into other formative-era cultures in chiapas oaxaca and the valley of mexico the formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions as well as artistic and architectural complexes.46 the formative-era of mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent cradles of civilization the aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them it was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected for example the southern peripheral zones of xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center the hegemonic nature of the aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered the aztec did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tributes were paid.50 the aztec of central mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central mexico.51 the aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale along with this practice they avoided killing enemies on the battlefield their warring casualty rate was far lower than that of their spanish counterparts whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during battle.52 this distinct mesoamerican cultural tradition of human sacrifice ended with the spanish conquest in the 16th century over the next centuries mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to spanish colonial rule.53 smallpox was a devastating disease it generally killed aztecs but not spaniards who as europeans had already been exposed to it in their cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity.60 the deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth of christianity in mexico and the americas at first the aztecs believed the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god but they later accepted their fate and no longer resisted the spanish rule.61 many of the surviving aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the christian god which resulted in their acceptance of catholicism and yielding to the spanish rule throughout mexico.62 the indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million pre-contact population the population decline was primarily the result of communicable diseases particularly smallpox introduced during the columbian exchange during the three hundred years of the colonial era mexico received between 400000 and 500000 europeans between 20000064 and 250000 africans65 and between 40000 and 120000 asians.66 the 18th century saw a great increase in the percentage of mestizos.67 colonial law with spanish roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction the cabildos and the spanish crown whereby upper administrative offices were closed to native-born people even those of pure spanish blood criollos administration was based on the racial separation of the population among republics of spaniards amerindians and castas autonomous and directly dependent on the king himself the council of indies and the mendicant religious orders which arrived in mesoamerica as early as 1524 labored to generate capital for the crown of spain and convert the amerindian populations to catholicism the 1531 marian apparitions to saint juan diego gave impetus to the evangelization of central mexico the virgin of guadalupe became a symbol of criollo patriotism68 and was used by the insurgents that followed miguel hidalgo during the war of independence some crypto-jewish families emigrated to mexico to escape the spanish inquisition the rich deposits of silver particularly in zacatecas and guanajuato resulted in silver extraction dominating the economy of new spain taxes on silver production became a major source of income for spain other important industries were the haciendas functioning under the encomienda and repartimiento systems and mercantile activities in the main cities and ports wealth created during the colonial era spurred the development of new spanish baroque as a result of its trade links with asia the rest of the americas africa and europe and the profound effect of new world silver central mexico was one of the first regions to be incorporated into a globalized economy being at the crossroads of trade people and cultures mexico city has been called the first world city.69 the nao de china manila galleons operated for two and a half centuries and connected new spain with asia goods were taken from veracruz to atlantic ports in the americas and spain veracruz was also the main port of entry in mainland new spain for european goods immigrants and african slaves the camino real de tierra adentro connected mexico city with the interior of new spain many mexican cultural features including tequila first distilled in the 16th century charreria 17th mariachi 18th and mexican cuisine a fusion of american and european particularly spanish cuisine arose during the colonial era in 1813 the congress of chilpancingo was convened and on november 6 signed the solemn act of the declaration of independence of northern america morelos was captured and executed on december 22 1815 during this period the frontier borderlands to the north became quite isolated from the government in mexico city and its monopolistic economic policies caused suffering with limited trade the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central government's actions in collecting customs resentment built up from california to texas both the mission system and the presidios had collapsed after the spanish withdrew from the colony causing great disruption especially in alta california and new mexico the people in the borderlands had to raise local militias to protect themselves from hostile native americans these areas developed in different directions from the center of the country.73 wanting to stabilize and develop the frontier mexico encouraged immigration into present-day texas as they were unable to persuade people from central mexico to move into those areas they allowed for religious freedom for the new settlers who were primarily protestant english speakers from the united states within several years the anglos far outnumbered the tejano in the area itinerant traders traveled through the area working by free market principles the tejano grew more separate from the government and due to its neglect many supported the idea of independence and joined movements to that end collaborating with the english-speaking americans.73 between 1940 and 1980 mexico remained a poor country but experienced substantial economic growth that some historians call the mexican miracle.82 although the economy continued to flourish for some social inequality remained a factor of discontent moreover the pri rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as 'mexico's dirty war'83 see the 1968 tlatelolco massacre84 which claimed the life of around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and as many as 800 protesters.85 salinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms which fixed the exchange rate controlled inflation and culminated with the signing of the north american free trade agreement nafta which came into effect on january 1 1994 the same day the zapatista army of national liberation ezln started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against neoliberalism and globalization in 1994 salinas was succeeded by ernesto zedillo followed by the mexican peso crisis and a $50 billion imf bailout major macroeconomic reforms were started by president zedillo and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7 by the end of 1999.89 contemporary mexico geography climate the tropic of cancer effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones land north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months south of the twenty-fourth parallel temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation this gives mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems in 2012 mexico passed a comprehensive climate change bill a first in the developing world that has set a goal for the country to generate 35 of its energy from clean energy sources by 2024 and to cut emissions by 50 by 2050 from the level found in 2000.9596 during the 2016 north american leaders summit the target of 50 of electricity generated from renewable sources by 2025 was announced.97 gran desierto de altararid

discovery in 1947 of the tuber barbasco dioscorea composita which has a high content of diosgenin revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills.104 government and politics government the united mexican states are a federation whose government is representative democratic and republican based on a presidential system according to the 1917 constitution the constitution establishes three levels of government the federal union the state governments and the municipal governments according to the constitution all constituent states of the federation must have a republican form of government composed of three branches the executive represented by a governor and an appointed cabinet the legislative branch constituted by a unicameral congresscitation neededoriginal research? and the judiciary which will include a state supreme court of justice they also have their own civil and judicial codes the federal legislature is the bicameral congress of the union composed of the senate of the republic and the chamber of deputies the congress makes federal law declares war imposes taxes approves the national budget and international treaties and ratifies diplomatic appointments.105 the federal congress as well as the state legislatures are elected by a system of parallel voting that includes plurality and proportional representation.106 the chamber of deputies has 500 deputies of these 300 are elected by plurality vote in single-member districts the federal electoral districts and 200 are elected by proportional representation with closed party lists107 for which the country is divided into five electoral constituencies.108 the senate is made up of 128 senators of these 64 senators two for each state and two for the federal district are elected by plurality vote in pairs 32 senators are the first minority or first-runner up one for each state and one for the federal district and 32 are elected by proportional representation from national closed party lists.107 the executive is the president of the united mexican states who is the head of state and government as well as the commander-in-chief of the mexican military forces the president also appoints the cabinet and other officers the president is responsible for executing and enforcing the law and has the power to veto bills.109 the highest organ of the judicial branch of government is the supreme court of justice the national supreme court which has eleven judges appointed by the president and approved by the senate the supreme court of justice interprets laws and judges cases of federal competency other institutions of the judiciary are the federal electoral tribunal collegiate unitary and district tribunals and the council of the federal judiciary.110 politics three parties have historically been the dominant parties in mexican politics the national action party a conservative party founded in 1939 and belonging to the christian democrat organization of america;111 the institutional revolutionary party a center-left party and member of socialist international112 that was founded in 1929 to unite all the factions of the mexican revolution and held an almost hegemonic power in mexican politics since then the party of the democratic revolution a left-wing party113 founded in 1989 as the successor of the coalition of socialists and liberal parties law enforcement while the government generally respects the human rights of its citizens serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations in the southern part of the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods.117 the national human rights commission has had little impact in reversing this trend engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations.118 by law all defendants have the rights that assure them fair trials and humane treatment however the system is overburdened and overwhelmed with several problems.117 crime drug cartels are a major concern in mexico.121 mexico's drug war has left over 60000 dead and perhaps another 20000 missing.122 the mexican drug cartels have as many as 100000 members.123 mexico's national geography and statistics institute estimated that in 2014 one out of five mexicans was victim of crime in some form.124 foreign relations the foreign relations of mexico are directed by the president of mexico130 and managed through the ministry of foreign affairs.131 the principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally recognized in the article 89 section 10 which include respect for international law and legal equality of states their sovereignty and independence non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries peaceful resolution of conflicts and promotion of collective security through active participation in international organizations.130 since the 1930s the estrada doctrine has served as a crucial complement to these principles.132 mexico is one of the founding members of several international organizations most notably the united nations133 the organization of american states134 the organization of ibero-american states135 the opanal136 and the rio group.137 in 2008 mexico contributed over 40 million dollars to the united nations regular budget.138 in addition it was the only latin american member of the organisation for economic co-operation and development since it joined in 1994 until chile gained full membership in 2010.139140 mexico is considered a regional power141142 hence its presence in major economic groups such as the g8+5 and the g-20 in addition since the 1990s mexico has sought a reform of the united nations security council and its working methods143 with the support of canada italy pakistan and other nine countries which form a group informally called the coffee club.144 military the mexican armed forces have two branches the mexican army which includes the mexican air force and the mexican navy the mexican armed forces maintain significant infrastructure including facilities for design research and testing of weapons vehicles aircraft naval vessels defense systems and electronics;151152 military industry manufacturing centers for building such systems and advanced naval dockyards that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies.153 in recent years mexico has improved its training techniques military command and information structures and has taken steps to becoming more self-reliant in supplying its military by designing as well as manufacturing its own arms154 missiles152 aircraft155 vehicles heavy weaponry electronics151 defense systems151 armor heavy military industrial equipment and heavy naval vessels.156 since the 1990s when the military escalated its role in the war on drugs increasing importance has been placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms aircraft helicopters digital war-fighting technologies151 urban warfare equipment and rapid troop transport.157 mexico has the capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons but abandoned this possibility with the treaty of tlatelolco in 1968 and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.158 in 1970 mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully refined weapons grade uranium159not in citation given which is used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons but in april 2010 mexico agreed to turn over its weapons grade uranium to the united states.160161 historically mexico has remained neutral in international conflicts162 with the exception of world war ii however in recent years some political parties have proposed an amendment of the constitution in order to allow the mexican army air force or navy to collaborate with the united nations in peacekeeping missions or to provide military help to countries that officially ask for it.163 administrative divisions the united mexican states are a federation of 31 free and sovereign states which form a union that exercises a degree of jurisdiction over the federal district and other territories each state has its own constitution congress and a judiciary and its citizens elect by direct voting a governor for a six-year term and representatives to their respective unicameral state congresses for three-year terms.164 the federal district is a special political division that belongs to the federation as a whole and not to a particular state and as such has more limited local rule than the nation's states.165 the states are divided into municipalities the smallest administrative political entity in the country governed by a mayor or municipal president presidente municipal elected by its residents by plurality.166 economy according to a 2008 un report the average income in a typical urbanized area of mexico was $26654 while the average income in rural areas just miles away was only $8403.178 daily minimum wages are set annually being set at $80.04 mexican pesos $4.5 usd in 2017.179 the electronics industry of mexico has grown enormously within the last decade mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after china united states japan south korea and taiwan mexico is the second largest exporter of electronics to the united states where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.180 the mexican electronics industry is dominated by the manufacture and oem design of televisions displays computers mobile phones circuit boards semiconductors electronic appliances communications equipment and lcd modules the mexican electronics industry grew 20 between 2010 and 2011 up from its constant growth rate of 17 between 2003 and 2009.180 currently electronics represent 30 of mexico's exports.180 the domestic car industry is represented by dina s.a. which has built buses and trucks since 1962187 and the new mastretta company that builds the high-performance mastretta mxt sports car.188 in 2006 trade with the united states and canada accounted for almost 50 of mexico's exports and 45 of its imports.13 during the first three quarters of 2010 the united states had a $46.0 billion trade deficit with mexico.189 in august 2010 mexico surpassed france to become the 9th largest holder of us debt.190 the commercial and financial dependence on the us is a cause for concern.191 the remittances from mexican citizens working in the united states account for 0.2 of mexico's gdp192 which was equal to us$20 billion per year in 2004 and is the tenth largest source of foreign income after oil industrial exports manufactured goods electronics heavy industry automobiles construction food banking and financial services.193 according to mexico's central bank remittances in 2008 amounted to $25bn.194 major players in the broadcasting industry are televisa the largest spanish media company in the spanish-speaking world195 and tv azteca communications energy energy production in mexico is managed by state-owned companies the federal commission of electricity and pemex pemex the public company in charge of exploration extraction transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas as well as the refining and distribution of petroleum products and petrochemicals is one of the largest companies in the world by revenue making us $86 billion in sales a year.201202203 mexico is the sixth-largest oil producer in the world with 3.7 million barrels per day.204 in 1980 oil exports accounted for 61.6 of total exports by 2000 it was only 7.3%.182 mexico is the country with the world's third largest solar potential.206 the country's gross solar potential is estimated at 5kwh/m2 daily which corresponds to 50 times national electricity generation.207 currently there is over 1 million square meters of solar thermal panels208 installed in mexico while in 2005 there were 115000 square meters of solar pv photo-voltaic it is expected that in 2012 there will be 18 million square meters of installed solar thermal panels.208 the project named segh-cfe 1 located in puerto libertad sonora northwest of mexico will have capacity of 46.8 mw from an array of 187200 solar panels when complete in 2013.209 all of the electricity will be sold directly to the cfe and absorbed into the utility's transmission system for distribution throughout their existing network at an installed capacity of 46.8 mwp when complete in 2013 the project will be the first utility scale project of its kind in mexico and the largest solar project of any kind in latin america science and technology the national autonomous university of mexico was officially established in 1910210 and the university become one of the most important institutes of higher learning in mexico.211 unam provides world class education in science medicine and engineering.212 many scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning such as national polytechnic institute founded in 1936213 were established during the first half of the 20th century most of the new research institutes were created within unam twelve institutes were integrated into unam from 1929 to 1973.214 in 1959 the mexican academy of sciences was created to coordinate scientific efforts between academics in 1995 the mexican chemist mario j molina shared the nobel prize in chemistry with paul j crutzen and f sherwood rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.215 molina an alumnus of unam became the first mexican citizen to win the nobel prize in science.216 tourism mexico has traditionally been among the most visited countries in the world according to the world tourism organization and it is the most visited country in the americas after the united states the most notable attractions are the mesoamerican ruins cultural festivals colonial cities nature reserves and the beach resorts the nation's wide range of climates from temperate to tropical and unique culture  a fusion of the european and the mesoamerican  make mexico an attractive destination the peak tourism seasons in the country are during december and the mid-summer with brief surges during the week before easter and spring break when many of the beach resort sites become popular destinations for college students from the united states as of 2016 mexico was the 8th most visited country in the world and had the 14th highest income from tourism in the world which is also the highest in latin america.218 the vast majority of tourists come to mexico from the united states and canada followed by europe and asia a smaller number also come from other latin american countries.219 in the 2017 travel and tourism competitiveness report mexico was ranked 22nd in the world which was 3rd in the americas.220 on the pacific coast is the notable tourist destination of acapulco once the destination for the rich and famous the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below transportation mexico has 233 airports with paved runways of these 35 carry 97 of the passenger traffic.199 the mexico city international airport remains the largest in latin america and the 44th largest in the world231 transporting 21 million passengers a year.232 water supply and sanitation among the achievements is a significant increase in access to piped water supply in urban areas 88 to 93% as well as in rural areas 50 to 74% between 1990 and 2010 additionally a strong nationwide increase in access to improved sanitation 64 to 85% was observed in the same period other achievements include the existence of a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation infrastructure with a national water commission as its apex institution and the existence of a few well-performing utilities such as aguas y drenaje de monterrey the challenges include water scarcity in the northern and central parts of the country inadequate water service quality drinking water quality 11 of mexicans receiving water only intermittently as of 2014;233 poor technical and commercial efficiency of most utilities with an average level of non-revenue water of 43.2 in 2010;234 an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment 36 in 2006 and still inadequate access in rural areas in addition to on-going investments to expand access the government has embarked on a large investment program to improve wastewater treatment demographics according to estimations made by mexico's national geography and statistics institute as of 2017 mexico has 123.5 million inhabitants235 making it the most populous spanish-speaking country in the world.236 between 2005 and 2010 the mexican population grew at an average of 1.70 per year up from 1.16 per year between 2000 and 2005 even though mexico is a very ethnically diverse country research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of mexico's government to unify all mexicans under a single ethnic identity that of the mestizo as a result since 1930 the only ethnic classification that has been included in mexican censuses has been that of indigenous peoples.237 even then across the years the government has used different criteria to count indigenous peoples with each of them returning considerably different numbers it is not until very recently that the mexican government begun conducting surveys that considered the afro-mexican and euro-mexican population that lives in the country as of 2015update the foreign-born population was 1007063.238 the majority of these individuals were born in the united states and mexico is home to the largest number of u.s citizens abroad.239 after americans the largest immigrant groups are guatemalans spaniards and colombians besides the spanish large immigrant-descended groups are the french germans lebanese and chinese mexico is the largest source of immigration to the united states.240 some 11.6 million residents of the united states have mexican citizenship as of 2014update.241 ethnicity and race the afro-mexican population 1381853 individuals as of 2015update264 is an ethnic group made up of descendants of colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-saharan african descent mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200000 africans were taken there primarily in the 17th century the creation of a national mexican identity especially after the mexican revolution emphasized mexico's indigenous and european past it passively eliminated the african ancestors and contributions most of the african-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding mestizo mixed european/indigenous and indigenous populations through unions among the groups evidence of this long history of intermarriage with mestizo and indigenous mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census 64.9 896829 of afro-mexicans also identified as indigenous it was also reported that 9.3 of afro-mexicans speak an indigenous language.265 the states with the highest self-report of afro-mexicans were guerrero 6.5 of the population oaxaca 4.95% and veracruz 3.28%.266 afro-mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the costa chica of oaxaca and costa chica of guerrero during the early 20th century a substantial number of arabs mostly christians267 began arriving from the crumbling ottoman empire the largest group were the lebanese and an estimated 400000 mexicans have some lebanese ancestry.268 smaller ethnic groups in mexico include south and east asians present since the colonial era during the colonial era asians were termed chino regardless of ethnicity and arrived as merchants artisans and slaves.269 the largest group were filipinos and some 200000 mexicans can trace filipino ancestry.270 modern asian immigration began in the late 19th century and at one point in the early 20th century the chinese were the second largest immigrant group.271 official censuses in recent times the mexican government has decided to conduct ethnic surveys and censuses again and has also widen the criteria to classify the ethnicies who were already considered an example being the indigenous mexican classification which was previously reserved to people who lived in indigenous communities and/or spoke an indigenous language according to these recent surveys indigenous peoples amount to 21.5 of mexico's population including people who declared to be partially indigenous254 afro-mexicans are 1.2 of mexico's population including people who declared to be partially african254 and european mexicans amount to 47 of mexico's population based on appearance rather than on self-declared of ancestry.258259260 less numerous groups in mexico such as asians and middle easterners are also accounted for albeit their numbers do not vary significantly from previous estimations out of all the ethnic groups that have recently been surveyed that of mestizos is notably absent which may be consequence of the ethnic label's fluid and subjective definition which complicates a precise calculation as well the tendency that mexicans have to identify people with static ethnic labels rather than fluid ones.278 languages the country has the largest spanish-speaking population in the world with almost a third of all spanish native speakers.236279 almost all of the mexican population speaks spanish 99.3 according to the latest census;280 nonetheless around 5.4 still speaks an indigenous language besides spanish the indigenous languages with the most speakers are nahuatl spoken by approximately 1.45 million people281 yukatek maya spoken by some 750000 people and the mixtec282 and zapotec languages283 each spoken by more than 400000 people the national institute of indigenous languages inali recognizes 68 linguistic groups and some 364 different specific varieties of indigenous languages.284 since the promulgation of the law of indigenous linguistic rights in 2003 these languages have had status as national languages with equal validity with spanish in all the areas and contexts in which they are spoken.285 in addition to the indigenous languages other minority languages are spoken by immigrant populations such as the 80000 german-speaking mennonites in mexico286 and 5000 speakers of the chipilo dialect of the venetian language spoken in chipilo puebla arabic is the most commonly spoken foreign language in mexico.287 urban areas here are the 20 largest urban areas in mexico religion the 929244892 catholics of mexico constitute in absolute terms the second largest catholic community in the world after brazil's.291 47 percent of them attend church services weekly.292 the feast day of our lady of guadalupe the patron saint of mexico is celebrated on december 12 and is regarded by many mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country.293 the 2010 census reported 314932 members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints2 though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members.294 about 25 of registered members attend a weekly sacrament service although this can fluctuate up and down.295 women until the twentieth century mexico was an overwhelmingly rural country with rural women's status defined within the context of the family and local community with urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century following the spanish conquest of the aztec empire cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages roman catholicism in mexico has shaped societal attitudes about women's social role emphasizing the role of women as nurturers of the family with the virgin mary as a model marianismo has been an ideal with women's role as being within the family under the authority of men in the twentieth century mexican women made great strides toward toward a more equal legal and social status in 1953 women in mexico were granted the vote in national elections as of 2014update mexico has the 16th highest rate of homicides committed against women in the world 300 the prevalence of domestic violence against women in mexican marital relationships varies at between 30 and 60 percent of relationships.301 the remains of the victims were frequently mutilated.302 according to a 1997 study domestic abuse in mexican culture is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in mexican women's dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self-esteem sustained by ideologies of romantic love by family structure and residential arrangements.303 the perpetrators are often the boyfriend father-in-law ex-husbands or husbands but only 1.6 of the murder cases led to an arrest and sentencing.302 culture mexican culture reflects the complexity of the country's history through the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of spain imparted during spain's 300-year colonization of mexico exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into mexican culture as time has passed literature visual arts mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of ancient egypt.citation needed spanish colonial architecture is marked by the contrast between the simple solid construction demanded by the new environment and the baroque ornamentation exported from spain.citation needed mexico as the center of new spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style cinema media music cuisine mexican cuisine is known for its intense and varied flavors colorful decoration and variety of spices most of today's mexican food is based on pre-columbian traditions including aztec and maya combined with culinary trends introduced by spanish colonists the conquistadores eventually combined their imported diet of rice beef pork chicken wine garlic and onions with the native pre-columbian food including maize tomato vanilla avocado guava papaya pineapple chili pepper beans squash sweet potato peanut and turkey mexican food varies by region because of local climate and geography and ethnic differences among the indigenous inhabitants

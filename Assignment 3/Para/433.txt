2017 north indian ocean cyclone season the 2017 north indian ocean cyclone season is a current event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation north indian ocean cyclone season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between april and december with the two peaks in may and november these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern indian ocean  contents  seasonal forecastedit over the indian ocean is the risk for at least a couple of tropical systems to make landfall this autumn according to accuweather.3 the best chance for tropical depressions or cyclones in the bay of bengal or the arabian sea will be during october and november during september one or two systems may be declared a depression over the northern bay of bengal and could strike eastern india in west bengal or orissa coasts.4 according to myanmar meteorological department a cyclone or depression is likely to form in the last week of october in andaman sea and travel towards the bay of bengal.5 season summaryedit systemsedit cyclonic storm maaruthaedit on april 13 an area of low pressure formed in the south bay of bengal under the

same day it further intensified into a deep depression and then into cyclonic storm maarutha.the system moved very fast under the influence of mid-latitude trough in westerlies lying over india in the middle and upper tropospheric levels.8 however strong vertical wind shear and unfavourable mjo inhibited rapid intensification or further intensification of the system moving northeastwards it reached its peak intensity in the early hours of 16th the system maintained its peak intensity till landfall near sandoway thandwe in myanmar in the midnight after landfall the system weakened into a deep depression in early hours of 17th into a depression in the morning and well marked low pressure area over central myanmar and neighbourhood in the forenoon of 17th.9 maarutha had already triggered heavy rainfall as a depression in sri lanka as well as the andaman and nicobar islands india due to a heavy swell in the sea around the andaman islands all ferries to havelock island from port blair

precursor low of mora strengthened the arrival of the monsoon causing heavy flooding in sri lanka and the andaman islands that killed 208 people deep depression bob 03edit depression bob 04edit land depression 01edit a well-marked low-pressure area over jharkhand and adjoining the gangetic west bengal intensified into a depression on july 26.31 it moved in a west-northwest direction until degenerated to a well marked low pressure area over east madhya pradesh during the next day.32 the storm in its precursor low caused dangerous floods in west bengal at least 152 people died33 while

240 mm rain along with sustained winds of 45 km/h.39 land depression 02edit under active monsoonal conditions a low pressure area formed over the north bay of bengal near south bangladesh on october 8.40 on the following day the system intensified further into a well-marked low pressure area over the same region and later into a depression over the northern bay of bengal near the west bengal coast the system was then given the identifier land 02 by the imd the storm intensified further into a deep depression later on the same day.41 moving in a north-northwesterly direction the storm interacted with an anticyclonic circulation which caused it to weaken rapidly into a low pressure area over west jharkhand on october 10 the system produced heavy rainfall in east india42 and also caused caused 3 deaths in odisha by lightning and heavy rainfall.4344 kolkata was badly affected by the dangerous weather receiving rain upto 124.4 mm.45 strong winds along with incessant rains slowed

having a partially exposed low level center while located in a marginally favorable environment for further development.52 later that day the imd upgraded the system to depression bob 05 as the system developed formative banding surrounding a center of deep thunderstorm activity.5354 despite being initially forecasted to intensify further the depression tracked into an environment with strong wind shear and failed to intensify making landfall on the odisha coast near paradip during the afternoon of 20 october.55 after landfall the system remained near the coastline allowing moisture incursion from the bay of bengal to prevent rapid weakening initially tracking northwards the system soon recurved towards the northeast before weakening into an area of low pressure early on 22 october while located over northeastern bangladesh meghalaya and southern assam.56 depression bob 06edit an area of low pressure formed in the south china sea the jma upgraded the low-pressure area to a tropical depression on october 30.63 the jtwc issued a tcfa during the next day as it gathered strength but the storm did not intensify further and degenerated into a remnant low.64 over in the course of two days after re-curving back to the gulf the jtwc re-issued a tcfa and the system made landfall in 65the malay peninsula and entered the andaman sea on the 9th of november.the storm moved westwards over

anemometer an anemometer is a device used for measuring the speed of wind and is also a common weather station instrument the term is derived from the greek word anemos which means wind and is used to describe any wind speed measurement instrument used in meteorology the first known description of an anemometer was given by leon battista alberti in 1450  contents  historyedit velocity anemometersedit cup anemometersedit a simple type of anemometer was invented in 1845 by dr john thomas romney robinson of armagh observatory it consisted of four hemispherical cups mounted on horizontal arms which were mounted on a vertical shaft the air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction turned the shaft at a rate that was proportional to the wind speed therefore counting the turns of the shaft over a set time period produced a value proportional to the average wind speed for a wide range of speeds on an anemometer with four cups it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross when robinson first designed his anemometer he asserted that the cups moved one-third of the speed of the wind unaffected by the cup size or arm length this was apparently confirmed by some early independent experiments but it was incorrect instead the ratio of the speed of the wind and that of the cups the anemometer factor depends on the dimensions of the cups and arms and may have a value between two and a little over three every previous experiment involving an anemometer had to be repeated the three-cup anemometer was further modified by the australian dr derek weston in 1991 to measure both wind direction and wind speed weston added a tag to one cup which causes the cupwheel speed to increase and decrease as the tag moves alternately with and against the wind wind direction is calculated from these cyclical changes in cupwheel speed while wind speed is determined from the average cupwheel speed three-cup anemometers are currently used as the industry standard for wind resource assessment studies  practice vane anemometersedit one of the other forms of mechanical velocity anemometer is the vane anemometer it may be described as a windmill or a propeller anemometer unlike the robinson anemometer whose axis of rotation is vertical the vane anemometer must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal furthermore since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes a wind vane or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed a vane anemometer thus combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument.2 the speed of the fan is measured by a rev counter and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip hence volumetric flowrate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known in cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same as in ventilating shafts of mines and buildings wind vanes known as air meters are employed and give satisfactory results.citation needed vane style of anemometer helicoid propeller anemometer incorporating a wind vane for orientation hand-held low-speed vane anemometer hand-held digital anemometer hot-wire anemometersedit hot wire anemometers use a very fine wire on the order of several micrometres electrically heated to some temperature above the ambient air flowing past the wire cools the wire as the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal tungsten is a popular choice for hot-wires a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the flow speed.3 several ways of implementing this exist and hot-wire devices can be further classified as cca constant current anemometer cva constant voltage anemometer and cta constant-temperature anemometer the voltage output from these anemometers is thus the result of some sort of circuit within the device trying to maintain the specific variable current voltage or temperature constant following ohm's law additionally pwm pulse-width modulation anemometers are also used wherein the velocity is inferred by the time length of a repeating pulse of current that brings the wire up to a specified resistance and then stops until a threshold floor is reached at which time the pulse is sent again hot-wire anemometers while extremely delicate have extremely high frequency-response and fine spatial resolution compared to other measurement methods and as such are almost universally employed for the detailed study of turbulent flows or any flow in which rapid velocity fluctuations are of interest an industrial version of the fine-wire anemometer is the thermal flow meter which follows the same concept but uses two pins or strings to monitor the variation in temperature the strings contain fine wires but encasing the wires makes them much more durable and capable of accurately measuring air gas and emissions flow in pipes ducts and stacks industrial applications often contain dirt that will damage the classic hot-wire anemometer laser doppler anemometersedit in laser doppler velocimetry laser doppler anemometers use a beam of light from a laser that is divided into two beams with one propagated out of the anemometer particulates or deliberately introduced seed material flowing along with air molecules near where the beam exits reflect or backscatter the light back into a detector where it is measured relative to the original laser beam when the particles are in great motion they produce a doppler shift for measuring wind speed in the laser light which is used to calculate the speed of the particles and therefore the air around the anemometer.4 ultrasonic anemometersedit two-dimensional wind sensors are of two types acoustic resonance anemometersedit acoustic resonance technology enables measurement within a small cavity the sensors therefore tend to be typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors the small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing this combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology one issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor for many end uses this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity and the fact that it does not require re-calibrating once installed ping-pong ball anemometersedit a common anemometer for basic use is constructed from a ping-pong ball attached to a string when the wind blows horizontally it presses on and moves the ball because ping-pong balls are very lightweight they move easily in light winds measuring the angle between the string-ball apparatus and the vertical gives an estimate of the wind speed this type of anemometer is mostly used for middle-school level instruction which most students make themselves but a similar device was also flown on phoenix mars lander.7 pressure anemometersedit the first designs of anemometers which measure the pressure were divided into plate and tube classes plate anemometersedit these are the first modern anemometers they consist of a flat plate suspended from the top so that the wind deflects the plate in 1450 the italian art architect leon battista alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer in 1664 it was re-invented by robert hooke who is often mistakenly considered the inventor of the first anemometer later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate either square or circular which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane the pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring the compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate and this is either read off on a suitable gauge or on a recorder instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds are inaccurate for high wind readings and are slow at responding to variable winds plate anemometers have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges tube anemometersedit james lind's anemometer of 1775 consisted of a glass u tube containing a liquid manometer pressure gauge with one end bent in a horizontal direction to face the wind and the other vertical end remains parallel to the wind flow though the lind was not the first it was the most practical and best known anemometer of this type if the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure on one side of the manometer the wind over the open end of a vertical tube causes little change in pressure on the other side of the manometer the resulting elevation difference in the two legs of the u tube is an indication of the wind speed however an accurate measurement requires that the wind speed be directly into the open end of the tube small departures from the true direction of the wind causes large variations in the reading the successful metal pressure tube anemometer of william henry dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end both are mounted at the same height the pressure differences on which the action depends are very small and special means are required to register them the recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water the pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.8 pitot tube static anemometersedit modern tube anemometers use the same principle as in the dines anemometer but using a different design the implementation uses a pitot-static tube which is a pitot tube with two ports pitot and static that is normally used in measuring the airspeed of aircraft the pitot port measures the dynamic pressure of the open mouth of a tube with pointed head facing wind and the static port measures the static pressure from small holes along the side on that tube the pitot tube is connected to a tail so that it always makes the tube's head to face the wind additionally the tube is heated to prevent rime ice formation on the tube.9 there are two lines from the tube down to the devices to measure the difference in pressure of the two lines the measurement devices can be manometers pressure transducers or analog chart recorders.10 effect of density on measurementsedit effect of icingedit at airports it is essential to have accurate wind data under all conditions including freezing precipitation anemometry is also required in monitoring and controlling the operation of wind turbines which in cold environments are prone to in-cloud icing icing alters the aerodynamics of an anemometer and may entirely block it from operating therefore anemometers used in these applications must be internally heated.11 both cup anemometers and sonic anemometers are presently available with heated versions instrument locationedit in order for wind speeds to be comparable from location to location the effect of the terrain needs to be considered especially in regard to height other considerations are the presence of trees and both natural canyons and artificial canyons urban buildings the standard anemometer height in open rural terrain is 10 meters.12 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

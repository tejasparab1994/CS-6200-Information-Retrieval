lake erie situated on the international boundary between canada and the united states lake erie's northern shore is the canadian province of ontario with the u.s states of michigan ohio pennsylvania and new york on its western southern and eastern shores these jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries the lake was named by the erie people a native americans people who lived along its southern shore the tribal name erie is a shortened form of the iroquoian word erielhonan meaning long tail.9  contents  geographyedit geographic featuresedit in a tug of war against the waves the two were finally hauled out by rope after being trapped for an hour-and-a-half baker was back on dry land exhausted and battered but alive point pelee national park the southernmost point of the canadian mainland is located on a peninsula extending into the lake several islands are found in the western end of the lake these belong to ohio except for pelee island and eight neighboring islands which are part of ontario major cities along lake erie include buffalo erie pennsylvania toledo ohio and cleveland ohio islandsedit islands tend to be located in the western side of the lake and total 31 in number 13 in canada 18 in the u.s. the island-village of put-in-bay on south bass island attracts young crowds who sometimes wear red bucket hats and are prone to break off cartwheels in the park and general merriment.21 kelleys island was depicted by the chicago tribune as having charms that were more subtle than put-in-bay and offers amenities such as beach lounging hiking biking and marveling at deep glacial grooves left in limestone.21 pelee island is the largest of erie's islands accessible by ferry from leamington ontario and sandusky ohio the island has a fragile and unique ecosystem with plants rarely found in canada such as wild hyacinth yellow horse gentian triosteum angustifolium and prickly pear cactus as well as two endangered snakes the blue racer and the lake erie water snake songbirds migrate to pelee in spring and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall.22 water levelsedit geologyedit historyedit native americansedit at the time of european contact there were several groups of indian cultures living around the shores of the eastern end of the lake the erie tribe from whom the lake takes its name lived along the southern edge while the neutrals also known as attawandaron lived along the northern shore near port stanley there is an indian village dating from the 16th century known as the southwold earthworks where as many as 800 neutral indians once lived the archaeological remains include double earth walls winding around the grass-covered perimeter.22 europeans named the tribe the neutral indians since these people refused to fight with other tribes.22 both tribes were conquered and assimilated by their hostile eastern neighbors the iroquois confederacy between ad 1651 and 1657 in what is referred to as part of the beaver wars.36 for decades after those wars the land around eastern lake erie was claimed and utilized by the iroquois as a hunting ground as the power of the iroquois waned during the last quarter of the 17th century several other mainly anishinaabe native american tribes displaced them from the territories they claimed on the north shore of the lake.37 there was a legend of an indian woman named huldah who despairing over her lost british lover hurled herself from a high rock from pelee island.18 european exploration and settlementedit during the war of 1812 oliver hazard perry captured an entire british fleet in 181339 near put-in-bay ohio despite having inferior numbers.40 american soldiers swept through the ontario area around port rowan burning towns and villages but spared a gristmill owned by a canadian mason named john backhouse according to one report.22 generally however despite the two exceptions being the american revolutionary war and the war of 1812 which involved conflicts between the u.s and great britain relations between the u.s and canada have been remarkably friendly with an unfortified boundary and an agreement that has kept all fleets of war off the great lakes.41 in 1837 rebellions broke about between canadian settlers and the british colonial government primarily over political reforms and land allocation issues some of the rebels stationed themselves in the u.s and crossed the ice from sandusky bay to pelee island wearing tattered overcoats and worn-out boots and carrying muskets pitchforks and swords18 but the islanders had already fled.18 later there was a battle on the ice with the royal 32nd regiment with the rebels being driven to retreat.18 settlers established commercial fisheries on the north coast of the lake around the 1850s.42 an important business was fishing.23 in the pre-civil war years railways sprouted everywhere and around 1852 there were railways circling the lake.43 maritime traffic picked up although the lake was usually closed because of ice from december to early april and ships had to wait for the ice to clear before proceeding.44 since slavery had been abolished in canada in 1833 but was still legal in southern states of the u.s. a lake erie crossing was sometimes required for fugitive slaves seeking freedom when kentucky fugitive lewis clarke arrived in cleveland he had no idea how to find canada i went out to the shore of the lake again and again to try and see the other side but i could see no hill mountain nor city of the asylum i sought he once told an interviewer i was afraid to inquire where canada was lest it would betray such a degree of ignorance as to excite suspicion at once. many fugitives also had to overcome fears instilled by their former masters.. merchant shippers lacked modern radar and weather forecasting so vessels were often caught up in intense gales there were reports of disasters usually from sea captains passing information to reporters in 1868 the captain of the grace whitney saw a sunken vessel three men clinging to the masthead but he could not help because of the gale and high seas.47 a balloonist named john steiner of philadelphia made an ambitious trip across the lake in 1857.48 he was described in the new york times as an eronaut or aeronaut powered boats were called propellers and fast was deemed railroad speed here's an account of the day-long voyage over the lake he arose to the height of about three miles and started off at a slow but steady rate .. the lake could be seen from one end to the other nearly .. at one time mr steiner counted 38 sail vessels all in sight and far below him the hands on board several of the vessels saw him and rightly apprehending that he was an aeronaut cheered him heartily .. he neared the canada shore a little below long point .. he was accordingly driven towards buffalo .. night was drawing on and it became apparent that he could not with this current get away from the water before dark and after nightfall it would not be safe to come down seeing a propeller .. the mary stewart .. he first struck the water about 25 miles below long point .. during this time mr steiner says he thinks his balloon bounded from the water at least twenty times it would strike and then rebound like a ball going into the air from twenty to fifty feet and still rushing down the lake at railroad speed .. mr steiner then abandoned the balloon leaping into the water and swimming towards the boat which speedily reached him.. in 1885 lake winds were so strong that water levels dropped substantially sometimes by as much as two feet so that at ports such as toledo watercraft could not load coal or depart the port.49 during the history of the lake as a fishery there has been marked battling by opposing interest groups here's an 1895 newspaper account in which critics of commercial fishing issued dire predictions and calling for government action to solve the problem the preservation of the fisheries of lake erie has become a serious problem to all who have given it close attention .. the fisheries are being exhausted by the wasteful methods which are now in vogue .. it is still the custom of the pound fishermen about sandusky to take fish of all sizes and if they are too small to be marketable they are turned over to a fertilizer factory if left undisturbed for two or three years more these little fish would be a very valuable product .. predictions of the lake being over-fished in 1895 were premature since the fishery has survived commercial and sport fishing pollution in the middle of the 20th century invasive species and other ailments but state and provincial governments as well as national governments have played a greater role as time went by business boomed in 1901 the carnegie company proposed building a new harbor near erie in elk creek to accommodate shipments from its tube-plant site nearby.51 in 1913 a memorial to commodore perry was built on put-in-bay island featuring a doric column.41 during the prohibition years from 1919 to 1933 a great deal of alcohol crossed erie18 along with mobster corpses dumped into the detroit river which sometimes washed up on the beaches of pelee island.52 according to one account al capone hid a fortune in the walls of the middle island luxury club but no money was found in it as of 2007 when the building no longer stood.18 the club had a basement casino with poker tables and slot machines.18 during the 20th century commercial fishing was prevalent but so was the boom in manufacturing industry around the lake and often rivers and streams were used as sewers to flush untreated sewage which ended up in the lake.53 sometimes poorly constructed sanitary systems meant that when old mains broke raw sewage would spill directly into the cuyahoga and into the lake.53 a report in time magazine in 1969 described the lake as a gigantic cesspool since only three of 62 beaches were rated completely safe for swimming.53 by 1975 the popular commercial fish blue pike had been declared extinct although the declaration may have been premature.54 by the 1980s there were about 130 fishing vessels with about 3000 workers42 but commercial fishing was declining rapidly particularly from the american side great lakes compactedit in 2005 the great lakes states of ohio michigan new york pennsylvania illinois indiana wisconsin minnesota and the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec endorsed the great lakes-st lawrence river basin sustainable water resources compact compact the compact was signed into law by president george w bush in september 2008 an international water rights policy overseen by the great lakes commission the compact aims to prevent diversion of water from great lakes to distant states as well as to set standards for use and conservation it had support from both political parties including former united states senator george voinovich r-oh and former governor jennifer granholm d-mi but is not popular in the southwestern states due to frequent drought conditions and water scarcity lake environmentedit weatheredit lake erie in winteredit like the other great lakes erie produces lake effect snow when the first cold winds of winter pass over the warm waters when the difference in temperature between the relatively warm surface water and the colder air reaches a threshold value of 18 to 23 degrees fahrenheit 10 to 13 degrees celsius then lake-effect snow becomes possible:55 as cold air flows over the warm water the lake warms and moistens the air since warm moist air is less dense than cold air the heated air rises rising air cools and water vapor condenses into cloud droplets .. the efficiency of snow production increases when the wind pushes the clouds over land friction with the ground causes air to pile up this frictional convergence creates lift and enhances snowfall the first ice usually forms in late november and by january it locks into place for islanders in the western basin it is the equivalent of summer vacation .. once the lake freezes islanders organize impromptu ice rallies families gather to drink hot wine and race all-terrain vehicles across the lake they also race iceboats which resemble sailboats on skates .. many people drive to other islands for dinner with friends they ride in cars with the roofs and doors chopped off so they can escape if the vehicles fall through the ice islanders stab evergreen trees into the ice every 50 yards to mark a route .. even in the coldest winters there are dangerous patches of thin ice the cracks are so predictable that the put-in-bay ice yacht club prints them on a map .. on a normal winter day the ice is dotted with 2000 fishing shanties windy conditionsedit they loom like gigantic aliens invading the farmers fields there are 66 of these creatures each about as tall as a 25-storey building with a face comprised of three enormous whiskers rotating 11 to 20 times per minute standing amidst the wind turbines of erie shore wind farm one feels like a doomed character in a sci-fi movie caught in the deathly still moment just before disaster strikes microclimatesedit the lake is also responsible for microclimates that are important to agriculture along its north shore is one of the richest areas of canada's fruit and vegetable production this southernmost tip particularly in the area around leamington is known as canada's tomato capital.70 the area around port rowan in ontario has special trees which grow because of the tempering effect of the lake and species include tulip trees flowering dogwood sassafras and sour gum.22 in this area there are many greenhouses which produce a variety of tropical plants rarely cultivated so far north including some species of cacti because of the lake's tempering effect.22 along the southeastern shore in ohio pennsylvania and new york is an important grape growing region as are the islands in the lake apple orchards are abundant in northeast ohio to western new york long term weather patternsedit ecosystemsedit lake erie has a complex ecosystem with many species in constant interaction human activity such as pollution and maritime ship traffic can affect this environment in numerous ways the interactions between the new species can sometimes have beneficial effects as well as harmful effects some introductions have been seen as beneficial such as the introduction of pacific salmon.52 occasionally there have been mass die-offs of certain species of fish sometimes for reasons unknown such as many numbers of rainbow smelt in may 2010.75 invasive speciesedit the lake has been plagued with a number of invasive species including zebra52 and quagga mussels the goby and the grass carp one estimate was that there have been 180 invasive species in the great lakes some having traveled in ballast water in international ships.76 zebra mussels and gobies have been credited with the increased population and size of smallmouth bass in lake erie.77 in 2008 there were concerns that the newest invader swarming in the great lakes which was the bloody-red shrimp might harm fish populations and promote algae blooms.78 environmentalists and biologists study lake conditions via installations such as the franz theodore stone laboratory on gibraltar island the lab which was established in 1895 is the oldest biological field station in the united states stone laboratory was donated to the ohio state university by julius stone in 1925 as part of the university's ohio sea grant college program.3476 in addition the great lakes institute of the university of windsor has experts who study issues such as lake sediment pollution and the flow of contaminants such as phosphorus.76 a list of the common invasive species in lake erie include zebra mussels quagga mussels round gobies spiny european water fleas fishhook water fleas the sea lamprey and white perch the invasive plant species that fill lake erie consist mainly of eurasian milfoil and purple loosestrife eutrophication and the infamous dead zoneedit an ongoing concern is that nutrient overloading from fertilizers human and animal waste known as eutrophication in which additional nitrogen and phosphorus enter the lake will cause plant life to run wild and multiply like crazy.11 since there are fewer wetlands which are like nature's kidneys by filtering nutrients as well as greater channelization of waterways nutrients in water can cause algal blooms to sprout as well as low-oxygen dead zones in a complex interaction of natural forces.11 as of the 2010s much of the phosphorus in the lake comes from fertilizer applied to no-till soybean and corn fields but washed into streams by heavy rains the algal blooms result from growth of microcystis a toxic blue-green algae that the zebra mussels which infest the lake don't eat.12 there periodically is a dead zone or region of low oxygen in the lake whose exact location varies scientists from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration have been studying the lake's blue-green algae blooms and trying to find ways to predict when they are spreading or where they might hit landfall typically the blooms arrive late each summer.13 this problem was extreme in the mid and late 1960's and the lake erie wastewater management study lewms conducted by the buffalo district of the us army corps of engineers determined that the eutrophication was due to point sources such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls as well as diffuse sources such as overland runoff from farm and forest land all these sources contribute nutrients primarily phosphorus to the lake growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted lewms made recommendations for reducing point source outflows as well as reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage employing no-till farming and other conservative practices many industrial and municipal sources have since then been greatly reduced the improved farming practices which were voluntary were followed for a while resulting in remarkable recovery of the lake in the 1970s.79 snakesedit the lake erie water snake a subspecies of the northern water snake nerodia sipedon lives in the vicinity of ohio's put-in-bay harbor and had been put on the threatened species list.82 a threatened species is one which may soon become an endangered species.83 by 2010 the water snake population was over 12000 snakes.82 while they have a non-venomous bite they are a key predator in the lake's aquatic ecosystem since they feed on mudpuppies and walleye and smallmouth bass.82 the snake was helpful in keeping the population of goby fish in check.82 they mate from late may through early june and can be found in large mating balls with one female bunched with several males.83 asian carpedit there is a concern that asian carp might enter the great lakes region and alter the ecosystem negatively.42 they have been described as greedy giants that suck plankton from the water with the brutal efficiency of vacuum cleaners and scientists worry that they may unravel the aquatic food web by crowding out other species.42 snakehead fishedit it gets such huge sizes it moves over land and it breathes air and it will eat anything it comes into contact with that's what freaks people out about it to see a fish moving across land gulping air agriculture and life around the lakeedit there have been incidents of birds dying from botulism in 200087 and in 2002.88 birds affected included grebes common and red-breasted mergansers loons diving ducks ring-billed gulls and herring gulls.87 one account suggests that bird populations are in trouble notably the woodland warbler which had population declines around 60 percent in 2008.52 possible causes for declines in bird populations are farming practices loss of habitats soil depletion and erosion and toxic chemicals.52 in 2006 there were concerns of possible bird flu after two wild swans on the lake were found diseased but it was learned that they did not contain the deadly h5n1 virus.89 there were sightings of a magnificent frigatebird a tropical bird with a two-metre wingspan over the lake in 2008.90 water quality issues and restorationedit lake erie infamously became very polluted in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the quantity of heavy industry situated in cities on its shores with reports of bacteria-laden beaches and fish contaminated by industrial waste.91 in the 1970s patches of the lake were declared dead because of industrial waste as well as sewage from runoffs as the new york times reporter denny lee wrote in 2004 the lake after all is where the rust belt meets the water.17 the water quality deteriorated partially due to increasing levels of the nutrient phosphorus76 in both the water and lake bottom sediments the resultant high nitrogen levels in the water caused eutrophication which resulted in algal blooms and algae masses92 and fish kills increasingly fouled the shoreline during this period there were incidents of the oily surfaces of tributary rivers emptying into lake erie catching fire in 1969 cleveland's cuyahoga river erupted in flames92 chronicled in a time magazine article which lamented a tendency to use rivers flowing through major cities as convenient free sewers;53 the detroit river caught fire on another occasion.52 the outlook was gloomy these events embarrassed officials and spurred local officials including cleveland's director of public utilities ben stefanski to pursue a massive effort to scrub the cuyahoga the effort cost $100 million in bonds according to one estimate.53 new sewer lines were built.53 clevelanders approved a bond issue by 2 to 1 to seriously upgrade cleveland's sewage system.53 federal officials acted as well the united states congress passed the clean water act of 1972.9293 in that year the united states and canada established water pollution limits in an international water quality agreement the corps lewms mentioned above was also instituted at that time the controls were effective but it took several decades to take effect by 1999 there were signs that large numbers of mayflies were spotted on the lake after a forty-year absence signalling a return to health.1785 the clearing of the water column is also partly due to the introduction and rapid spread of zebra mussels from europe which had the effect of covering the basin floor like shag carpeting with each creature filtering a liter of fresh water a day helping to restore the lake to a cleaner state.17 the 1972 great lakes water quality agreement also significantly reduced the dumping and runoff of phosphorus into the lake the lake has since become clean enough to allow sunlight to infiltrate its water and produce algae and sea weed but a dead zone persists in the central lake erie basin during the late summer the united states environmental protection agency has studied this cyclic phenomenon since 2005.94 there have been instances of beach closings at presque isle off the coast of northwestern pennsylvania because of unexplained e coli contaminations95 possibly caused by storm water overflows after heavy downpours since the 1970s environmental regulation has led to a great increase in water quality and the return of economically important fish species such as walleye and other biological life.96 there was substantial evidence that the new controls had substantially reduced levels of ddt in the water by 1979.27 cleanup efforts were described in 1979 as a notable environmental success story suggesting that the cumulative effect of legislation studies and bans had reversed the effects of pollution:27 the globs of oil the multicolored industrial discharges the flotsam from shoreline cities the fecal and bacterial wastes are no longer dumped in the lakes in vast quantities other ecosystem related issuesedit there was a tentative exploratory plan to capture co2 compress it to a liquid form and pump it a half-mile 800 m beneath lake erie's surface underneath the porous rock structure.97 according to chemical engineer peter douglas there is sufficient storage space beneath lake erie to hold between 15 and 50 years of liquid co2 emissions from the 4000 megawatt nanticoke coal plant.97 but there has been no substantial progress on this issue since 2007 economyedit fishingedit species of fishedit lake erie is home to one of the world's largest freshwater commercial fisheries lake erie's fish populations are the most abundant of the great lakes partially because of the lake's relatively mild temperatures and plentiful supply of plankton which is the basic building block of the food chain.42 the lake's fish population accounts for an estimated 50 of all fish inhabiting the great lakes.98 the lake is loaded with superstars such as steelhead99 walleye american usage or pickerel canadian usage4299 smallmouth bass99 perch99 as well as bass trout salmon whitefesh smelt and many others.42 the lake consists of a long list of well established introduced species common non-indigenous fish species include the rainbow smelt alewife white perch and common carp non-native sport fish such as rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked specifically for anglers to catch attempts failed to stock coho salmon and its numbers are once again dwindling commercial landings are dominated by yellow perch and walleye with substantial quantities of rainbow smelt and white bass also taken anglers target walleye and yellow perch with some effort directed at rainbow trout a variety of other species are taken in smaller quantities by both commercial and sport fleets up until the end of the 1950s the most commonly caught commercial fish more than 50 of the commercial catch was a subspecies of the walleye known as the blue walleye sander vitreus glaucus sometimes erroneously called blue pike in the 1970s and 1980s as pollution in the lake declined counts of walleyes which were caught grew from 112000 in 1975 to 4.1 million in 1985 with estimates of the numbers of walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin with many of 8 pounds or more.100 not all walleyes thrived the combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse and in the mid-1980s one species of walleye called the blue walleye was declared extinct but the lake erie walleye was reportedly having record numbers even in 1989 according to one report.101 there have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in walleye fish a study by the canadian ministry of the environment noted an increasing concentration trend but that limits were within acceptable established by authorities in pennsylvania.102 it was recommended because of pcbs that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month.102 because of these and other concerns in 1990 the national wildlife federation was on the verge of having a negative fish consumption advisory for walleyes and smallmouth bass which had been the bread-and-butter catch of an $800 million commercial fishing industry.103 the longest fish in lake erie is reportedly the sturgeon which can grow to ten feet long and weight 300 pounds but it is an endangered species and mostly lives on the bottom of the lake.104 in 2009 there was a confirmed instance of a sturgeon being caught which was returned to the lake alive and there are hopes that the population of sturgeons is resurging.105 commercial fishingedit estimates vary about the fishing market for the great lakes region one estimate of the total market for fishing including commercial as well as sport or recreational fishing for all of the great lakes was $4 billion annually in 2007.13 a second estimate was that the fishing industry was valued at more than $7 billion.42 but since high levels of pollution were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s there has been continued debate over the desired intensity of commercial fishing commercial fishing in lake erie has been hurt by the bad economy as well as government regulations which limit the size of their catch one report suggested that the numbers of fishing boats and employees had declined by two-thirds in recent decades.42 another concern had been that pollution in the lake as well as toxins found inside fish were working against commercial fishing interests.92 u.s fishermen based along lake erie lost their livelihood over the past few decades described as being caught in a net of laws and bans according to the pittsburgh post-gazette and no longer catch fish such as whitefish for markets in new york.23 pennsylvania had a special $3 stamp on fishing licenses to help compensate commercial fishermen for their losses but this program ended after five years turning erie's commercial fishing industry into an artifact.23 one blamed the commercial fishing ban after a test of wills between commercial and recreational fishermen one side needed large hauls the other feared the lake was being emptied.23 government regulation of fishingedit the lake can be thought of as a common asset with multiple purposes including being a fishery there was direct competition between commercial fishermen and sport fishermen including charter boats and sales of fishing licenses throughout the lake's history with both sides seeking government assistance from either washington or ottawa and trying to make their case in the court of public opinion through newspaper reporting.50 but other groups have entered the political process as well including environmentalists lakefront property owners industry owners and workers seeking cost-effective solutions for sewage ferry boat operators even corporations making electric-generating wind turbines management of the fishery is by consensus of all management agencies with an interest in the resource and include the states of new york pennsylvania ohio michigan and the province of ontario and work under the mandate of the great lakes fishery commission the commission makes assessments using sophisticated mathematical modeling systems the commission has been the focus of considerable recrimination primarily from angler and charter fishing groups in the u.s which have had a historical antipathy to commercial fishing interests this conflict is complex dating from the 1960s and earlier with the result in the united states that in 2011 commercial fishing was mostly eliminated from great lakes states one report suggests that battling between diverse fishing interests began around lake michigan and evolved to cover the entire great lakes region.108 the analysis suggests that in the lake erie context the competition between sport and commercial fishing involves universals and that these conflicts are cultural not scientific and therefore not resolvable by reference to ecological data.109 sport fishingedit the lake also supports a strong sport fishery while commercial fishing declined sport fishing has remained the deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing is in the canadian side of the lake.110 as a result a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport.110 if their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake upon returning to the american shore passengers will have to drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures to customs officers by videophone.110 there are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well who will have to fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft.110 authorities in 2008 from the pennsylvania fish and boat commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what's called a put-grow-and-take fishery.111 there was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the american side from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in ohio alone during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake.100 in 1984 ohio sold 27000 nonresident fishing permits and sport fishing was described as big business.100 in 1992 there were accounts of fishermen catching 8 10 and 12 pound walleyes and that the runt of a five-man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds.112 it is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout mudblow lawyer fish cusk or freshwater cod which looks ugly but tastes great the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of erie's glacial relics.99 ice fishingedit in winter when the lake freezes many fishermen go out on the ice cut holes and fish it is even possible to build bonfires on the ice.64 but venturing on lake erie ice can be dangerous in a freak incident in 2009 warming temperatures and winds of 35 miles per hour and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles-wide ice floe which broke away from the shore trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats.113 the day began with fishermen setting down wooden pallets to create a bridge over a crack in the ice so they could roam farther out on the lake but the planks fell into the water when the ice shifted stranding the fishermen about 1000 yards offshore .. when fishermen realized late saturday morning that the ice had broken away they began to debate the best way off some chose to sit and wait for authorities while others headed east in search of an ice bridge .. others managed to get to land on their own by riding their all-terrain vehicles about five miles east to where ice hadn't broken away .. when the rescued fishermen made it to shore authorities had them line up single-file to take down their names agricultureedit the lake's formerly more extensive lakebed creates a favorable environment for agriculture in the bordering areas of ontario ohio michigan pennsylvania and new york the lake erie sections of western new york state have a suitable climate for growing grapes and in chautauqua county there have been many vineyards and wineries in the area as well as in erie county in northwestern pennsylvania.114 much grape juice is produced in this region.114 the canadian region of lake erie's north shore is becoming a more prominent wine region as well it has been dubbed the lake erie north shore or lens region and includes pelee island115 and since it is farther north than comparable wine-growing areas in the world the season is longer in terms of light.116 a longer growing season due to the lake-moderated temperatures make the risk of early frosts less likely.116 the drainage basin has led to well fertilized soil the north coast of ohio is widely referred to as its nursery capital.117 tourismedit diving for shipwrecksedit among the diving community they are considered world class offering opportunities to visit an underwater museum that most people will never see the finding of the well-preserved wreck of the canadian-built british troop transport warship caledonia sunk during the war of 1812 has led to accusations about plundering of the site and legal wrangling about whether the vessel should be resurfaced in time for the 2013 war's bicentennial.124 research into shipwrecks has been organized by the peachman lake erie shipwreck research center or plesrc located on the grounds of the great lakes historical society.39 in 2008 the great lakes historical society announced plans to survey the underwater battle site of the battle of lake erie in preparation for the bicentennial celebration of the battle in 2013.39 public parksedit crystal beach in the village of crystal beach ontario at the eastern end of the lake is one of many south-facing beaches on the canadian side as such it is perfectly situated for sun-lovers and bathers facing the sun from sunrise to spectacular sunset the beach is gently sloping with no sharp drop-offs or rip currents and is usually cooled by southwest breezes even on the hottest days bikingedit islandsedit lake erie islands tend to be in the westernmost part of the lake and have different characters some of them include water sportsedit lighthousesedit the lake is dotted by distinct lighthouses a lighthouse off the coast of cleveland beset with cold lake winter spray has an unusual artistic icy shape although sometimes ice prevents the light from being seen by maritime vessels.132 towns along the lakeedit a new york times reporter biking through the region in 1997 found the ontario town of port stanley to be the prettiest of the port towns with a lively holiday air but no ticky-tacky commercialism.22 vineyardsedit there are numerous vineyards around the lake including ones on pelee island which makes wines including pinot noir riesling and chardonnay.22 summer rentalsedit people can rent summer houses and cabins near the lake to enjoy the beaches swimming as well as be close to activities such as wine tours and fishing and water parks.133 presque isle is a peninsula jutting out into the lake in northwestern pennsylvania which has nice beaches although there were incidents in 2006 when beaches had to be closed because of unexplained unhealthy water conditions with e coli bacteria.95 it was described as a spit of sand trees and swamp that arcs off the shore with seafood restaurants and

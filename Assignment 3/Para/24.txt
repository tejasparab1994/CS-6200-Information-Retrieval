microburst a microburst is a small downdraft that moves in a way opposite to a tornado microbursts are found in strong thunderstorms.1 there are two types of microbursts within a thunderstorm wet microbursts and dry microbursts they go through three stages in their cycle the downburst outburst and cushion stages a microburst can be particularly dangerous to aircraft especially during landing due to the wind shear caused by its gust front several fatal and historic crashes have been attributed to the phenomenon over the past several decades and flight crew training goes to great lengths on how to properly recover from a microburst/wind shear event a microburst often has high winds that can knock over fully grown trees they usually last from a couple of seconds to several minutes  contents  history of termedit a distinction can be made between a wet microburst which consists of precipitation and a dry microburst which typically consists of virga.4 they generally are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface but they perhaps also could be powered from the high speed winds of the jet stream deflected toward the surface by a thunderstorm or by dynamical processes see rear flank downdraft microbursts have also been called air bombs.5 dry microburstsedit when rain falls below the cloud base or is mixed with dry air it begins to evaporate and this evaporation process cools the air the cool air descends and accelerates as it approaches the ground when the cool air approaches the ground it spreads out in all directions and this divergence of the wind is the signature of the microburst high winds spread out in this type of pattern showing little or no curvature are known as straight-line winds.6 dry microbursts produced by high based thunderstorms that generate little to no surface rainfall occur in environments characterized by a thermodynamic profile exhibiting an inverted-v at thermal and moisture profile as viewed on a skew-t log-p thermodynamic diagram wakimoto 1985 developed a conceptual model over the high plains of the united states of a dry microburst environment that comprised three important variables mid-level moisture a deep and dry adiabatic lapse rate in the sub-cloud layer and low surface relative humidity wet microburstsedit development stages of microburstsedit the evolution of downbursts is broken down into three stages the contact stage the outburst stage and the cushion stage a downburst initially develops as the downdraft begins its descent from the cloud base the downdraft accelerates and within minutes reaches the ground contact stage it is during the contact stage the highest winds are observed during the outburst stage the wind curls as the cold air of the downburst moves away from the point of impact with the ground during the cushion stage winds about the curl continue to accelerate while the winds at the surface slow due to friction.8 when the two plates hit each other it forms a tornado and is very dangerous for an aircraft to land in this situation physical processes of dry and wet microburstsedit basic physical processes using simplified buoyancy equationsedit start by using the vertical momentum equation the first term is the effect of perturbation pressure gradients on vertical motion in some storms this term has a large effect on updrafts rotunno and klemp 1982 but there is not much reason to believe it has much of an impact on downdrafts at least to a first approximation and therefore will be ignored the second term is the effect of buoyancy on vertical motion clearly in the case of microbursts one expects to find that b is negative meaning the parcel is cooler than its environment this cooling typically takes place as a result of phase changes evaporation melting and sublimation precipitation particles that are small but are in great quantity promote a maximum contribution to cooling and hence to creation of negative buoyancy the major contribution to this process is from evaporation negative vertical motion associated only with buoyancyedit using pure parcel theory results in a prediction of the maximum downdraft of where nape is the negative available potential energy danger to aircraftedit the scale and suddenness of a microburst makes it a notorious danger to aircraft particularly those at low altitude which are taking off or landing the following are some fatal crashes and/or aircraft incidents that have been attributed to microbursts in the vicinity of airports a microburst often causes aircraft to crash when they are attempting to land the above-mentioned boac and pan am flights are notable exceptions the microburst is an extremely powerful gust of air that once hitting the ground spreads in all directions as the aircraft is coming in to land the pilots try to slow the plane to an appropriate speed when the microburst hits the pilots will see a large spike in their airspeed caused by the force of the headwind created by the microburst a pilot inexperienced with microbursts would try to decrease the speed the plane would then travel through the microburst and fly into the tailwind causing a sudden decrease in the amount of air flowing across the wings the decrease in airflow over the wings of the aircraft causes a drop in the amount of lift produced this decrease in lift combined with a strong downward flow of air can cause the thrust required to remain at altitude to exceed what is available thus causing the aircraft to stall.10 if the plane is at a low altitude shortly after takeoff or during landing it will not have sufficient altitude to recover the strongest microburst recorded thus far occurred at andrews field maryland on august 1st 1983 with wind speeds reaching 240.5 km/h 149.5 mi/h.12 danger to buildingsedit see alsoedit referencesedit notes bibliography external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

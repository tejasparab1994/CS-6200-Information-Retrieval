madagascar until the late 18th century the island of madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances beginning in the early 19th century most of the island was united and ruled as the kingdom of madagascar by a series of merina nobles the monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the french colonial empire from which the island gained independence in 1960 the autonomous state of madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods termed republics since 1992 the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at antananarivo however in a popular uprising in 2009 president marc ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in march 2009 to andry rajoelina constitutional governance was restored in january 2014 when hery rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community madagascar is a member of the united nations the african union au the southern african development community sadc and the organisation internationale de la francophonie  contents  etymologyedit geographyedit the western and southern sides which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands are home to dry deciduous forests spiny forests and deserts and xeric shrublands due to their lower population densities madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau the western coast features many protected harbors but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.19 climateedit ecologyedit as a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents madagascar is home to an abundance of plants and animals found nowhere else on earth.2324 approximately 90 of all plant and animal species found in madagascar are endemic25 including the lemurs a type of strepsirrhine primate the carnivorous fossa and many birds this distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to madagascar as the eighth continent26 and the island has been classified by conservation international as a biodiversity hotspot.23 like its flora madagascar's fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism lemurs have been characterized as madagascar's flagship mammal species by conservation international.23 in the absence of monkeys and other competitors these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species as of 2012update there were officially 103 species and subspecies of lemur45 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008.46 they are almost all classified as rare vulnerable or endangered at least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since humans arrived on madagascar all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species.47 endemic fish of madagascar include two families 15 genera and over 100 species primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers although invertebrates remain poorly studied on madagascar researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species all 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic as are a majority of the island's butterflies scarab beetles lacewings spiders and dragonflies.23 environmental issuesedit historyedit early periodedit by 1600 irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland betsileo kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring kingdom of imerina a century later.70 the rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century.52 the oral histories of the merina people who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago describe encountering an established population they called the vazimba probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced austronesian settlement wave the vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the merina kings andriamanelo ralambo and andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries.72 today the spirits of the vazimba are revered as tompontany ancestral masters of the land by many traditional malagasy communities.73 arab and european contactsedit madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the indian ocean in the early centuries following human settlement the written history of madagascar began with the arabs who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced islam the arabic script used to transcribe the malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe arab astrology and other cultural elements.20 european contact began in 1500 when the portuguese sea captain diogo dias sighted the island.14 the french established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.20 from about 1774 to 1824 madagascar gained prominence among pirates and european traders particularly those involved in the trans-atlantic slave trade the small island of nosy boroha off the northeastern coast of madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of libertalia.74 many european sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island among them robert drury whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern madagascar during the 18th century.75 the wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.76 among these were the betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the sakalava chiefdoms of menabe and boina on the west coast the kingdom of imerina located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of antananarivo emerged at around the same time under the leadership of king andriamanelo.77 kingdom of madagascaredit french colonizationedit primarily on the basis that the lambert charter had not been respected france invaded madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first franco-hova war.86 at the end of the war madagascar ceded the northern port town of antsiranana diego suarez to france and paid 560000 francs to lambert's heirs.87 in 1890 the british accepted the full formal imposition of a french protectorate on the island but french authority was not acknowledged by the government of madagascar to force capitulation the french bombarded and occupied the harbor of toamasina on the east coast and mahajanga on the west coast in december 1894 and january 1895 respectively.88 under colonial rule plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops.91 slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500000 slaves were freed many remained in their former masters homes as servants92 or as sharecroppers in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today.93 wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of antananarivo94 and the rova palace compound was turned into a museum.95 additional schools were built particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the merina had not reached education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on french language and practical skills.96 the merina royal tradition of taxes paid in the form of labor was continued under the french and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to antananarivo.97 malagasy troops fought for france in world war i.14 in the 1930s nazi political thinkers developed the madagascar plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of europe's jews.98 during the second world war the island was the site of the battle of madagascar between the vichy government and the british.99 the occupation of france during the second world war tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement leading to the malagasy uprising of 1947.100 this movement led the french to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the loi cadre overseas reform act and madagascar moved peacefully towards independence.101 the malagasy republic was proclaimed on 14 october 1958 as an autonomous state within the french community a period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 june 1960.102 independent stateedit gabriel ramanantsoa a major general in the army was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975 colonel richard ratsimandrava appointed to succeed him was assassinated six days into his tenure general gilles andriamahazo ruled after ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee vice admiral didier ratsiraka who ushered in the socialist-marxist second republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993 this period saw a political alignment with the eastern bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity these policies coupled with economic pressures stemming from the 1973 oil crisis resulted in the rapid collapse of madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards20 and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979 the ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the international monetary fund world bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.103 governmentedit structureedit madagascar is a semi-presidential representative democratic multi-party republic wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a prime minister who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers according to the constitution executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet the senate and the national assembly although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role the constitution establishes independent executive legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.14 the public directly elects the president and the 127 members of the national assembly to five-year terms all 33 members of the senate serve six-year terms with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president the last national assembly election was held on 20 december 201314 and the last senate election was held on 30 december 2015.106 at the local level the island's 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council provinces are further sub-divided into regions and communes the judiciary is modeled on the french system with a high constitutional court high court of justice supreme court court of appeals criminal tribunals and tribunals of first instance.107 the courts which adhere to civil law lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.108 antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of madagascar.14 it is located in the highlands region near the geographic center of the island king andrianjaka founded antananarivo as the capital of his imerina kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured vazimba capital on the hilltop of analamanga.72 as merina dominance expanded over neighboring malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the kingdom of madagascar antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island in 1896 the french colonizers of madagascar adopted the merina capital as their center of colonial administration the city remained the capital of madagascar after regaining independence in 1960 in 2017 the capital's population was estimated at 1391433 inhabitants.109 the next largest cities are antsirabe 500000 toamasina 450000 and mahajanga 400000.14 politicsedit since madagascar gained independence from france in 1960 the island's political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests several disputed elections an impeachment two military coups and one assassination the island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged with detrimental effects on the local economy international relations and malagasy living standards the eight-month standoff between incumbent ratsiraka and challenger marc ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.110 a series of protests led by andry rajoelina against ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent with more than 170 people killed.111 modern politics in madagascar are colored by the history of merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century the consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.112 madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream african affairs despite being a founding member of the organisation of african unity which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the african union madagascar was not permitted to attend the first african union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election but rejoined the african union in july 2003 after a 14-month hiatus madagascar was again suspended by the african union in march 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to rajoelina.113 madagascar is a member of the international criminal court with a bilateral immunity agreement of protection for the united states military.14 eleven countries have established embassies in madagascar including france the united kingdom the united states china and india.114 human rights in madagascar are protected under the constitution and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the universal declaration of human rights and the convention on the rights of the child.115 religious ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations.57115 torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems ravalomanana's 2004 creation of bianco an anti-corruption bureau resulted in reduced corruption among antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.57 securityedit the rise of centralized kingdoms among the sakalava merina and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century initially equipped with spears but later with muskets cannons and other firearms.116 by the early 19th century the merina sovereigns of the kingdom of madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30000.117 french attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-prime minister rainilaiarivony to solicit british assistance to provide training to the merina monarchy's army despite the training and leadership provided by british military advisers the malagasy army was unable to withstand french weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at antananarivo madagascar was declared a colony of france in 1897.118 the political independence and sovereignty of the malagasy armed forces which comprises an army navy and air force was restored with independence from france in 1960.119 since this time the malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest under the socialist second republic admiral didier ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991.120121 the armed forces are under the direction of the minister of the interior107 and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis as during the protracted standoff between incumbent ratsiraka and challenger marc ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate this tradition was broken in 2009 when a segment of the army defected to the side of andry rajoelina then-mayor of antananarivo in support of his attempt to force president ravalomanana from power.57 the minister of the interior is responsible for the national police force paramilitary force gendarmerie and the secret police.107 the police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level however in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps.122 traditional community tribunals called dina are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak historically security has been relatively high across the island.57 violent crime rates are low and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft although child prostitution human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.107 budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.57 administrative divisionsedit madagascar is subdivided into 22 regions faritra.14 the regions are further subdivided into 119 districts 1579 communes and 17485 fokontany.122 united nations involvementedit madagascar became a member state of the united nations on 20 september 1960 shortly after gaining its independence on 26 june 1960.125 as of january 2017 34 police officers from madagascar are deployed in haiti as part of the united nations stabilisation mission in haiti.126 starting in 2015 under the direction of and with assistance from the un the world food programme started the madagascar country programme with the two main goals of long-term development reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of madagascar.127 these goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both the quantity and quality of their production as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.127 economyedit the imf forced madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s the political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of imf and world bank assistance conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under zafy who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the state before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon zafy's impeachment the imf agreed to write off half madagascar's debt in 2004 under the ravalomanana administration having met a set of stringent economic governance and human rights criteria madagascar became the first country to benefit from the millennium challenge account in 2005.14 natural resources and tradeedit madagascar's natural resources include a variety of unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources agriculture including raffia fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla cloves135 and ylang-ylang.21 other key agricultural resources include coffee lychees and shrimp key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones and madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires which were discovered near ilakaka in the late 1990s.136 infrastructure and mediaedit radio broadcasts remain the principal means by which the malagasy population access international national and local news only state radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting.108 in addition to the state television channel a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout madagascar several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves including the media groups mbs owned by ravalomanana and viva owned by rajoelina57 contributing to political polarization in reporting healthedit in 2017 madagascar had an outbreak of the bubonic plague also known as the black death that affected urban areas.145 educationedit by the end of the 19th century madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial sub-saharan africa access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period with french language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum during the post-colonial first republic a continued reliance on french nationals as teachers and french as the language of instruction displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.20 consequently under the socialist second republic french instructors and other nationals were expelled malagasy was declared the language of instruction and a large cadre of young malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.147 this policy known as malgachization coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education those schooled during this period generally failed to master the french language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty excepting the brief presidency of albert zafy from 1992 to 1996 ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.148 government school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per fokontany and one lower secondary school within each commune at least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers.122 the three branches of the national public university are located at antananarivo founded in 1961 mahajanga 1977 and fianarantsoa 1988 these are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges.20 demographicsedit ethnic groupsedit languagesedit the malagasy language is of malayo-polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island the numerous dialects of malagasy which are generally mutually intelligible155 can be clustered under one of two sub-groups eastern malagasy spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the merina dialect of antananarivo and western malagasy spoken across the western coastal plains french became the official language during the colonial period when madagascar came under the authority of france in the first national constitution of 1958 malagasy and french were named the official languages of the malagasy republic madagascar is a francophone country and french is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.20 no official languages were recorded in the constitution of 1992 although malagasy was identified as the national language nonetheless many sources still claimed that malagasy and french were official languages eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in april 2000 on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the french language was unconstitutional the high constitutional court observed in its decision that in the absence of a language law french still had the character of an official language.156 in the constitution of 2007 malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced malagasy french and english.157 english was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the november 2010 referendum.1 the outcome of the referendum and its consequences for official and national language policy are not recognized by the political opposition who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the way the election was organized by the high transitional authority.104 language policy over the years madagascar has had different language policies under different influences of authority the indigenous language of madagascar malagasy was the predominant language on the island until the french colonization in 1897 malagasy has developed throughout the decades from an oral language to a language that has a written system latin orthography a change that was enforced by king radama i in 1823 following the french colonization the language of instruction and media changed from malagasy to almost exclusively french moreover the first french governor-general gallieni also encouraged the french officials to learn malagasy as well after the advent of the malagasy independence the madagascans tried to reinstate malagasy as a language of instruction especially in secondary schools however the language policy was inadequately planned and malagasy was struggling to surpass french as the language of instruction.158 today madagascar has two official languages malagasy and french madagascar managed to maintain the indigenous language malagasy in society and in schools despite the colonizing power malagasy and french are both the language of instruction in primary and secondary schools in madagascar the inclusion of the african language as a medium of instruction is usually uncommon in other colonized african countries.159 religionedit religion in madagascar 2010 according to the pew research center160 according to the us department of state 41 of madagascans practice christianity and 52 practice traditional religion14 which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana ancestors the veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana whereby a deceased family member's remains are exhumed and re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb the famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory reunite with family and community and enjoy a festive atmosphere residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.161 consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them it is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways they may intervene on behalf of the living conversely misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected the sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors in addition the malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god called zanahary or andriamanitra.162 according to the pew research center only 4.5 of madagascans practice folk religions and 85 are christian with practitioners of protestantism outnumbering adherents to roman catholicism.160 in 1818 the london missionary society sent the first christian missionaries to the island where they built churches translated the bible into the malagasy language and began to gain converts beginning in 1835 queen ranavalona i persecuted these converts as part of an attempt to halt european cultural and political influence on the island in 1869 a successor queen ranavalona ii converted the court to christianity and encouraged christian missionary activity burning the sampy royal idols in a symbolic break with traditional beliefs.163 today many christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors for instance they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a christian minister to consecrate a famadihana reburial.161 the malagasy council of churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent christian denominations of madagascar roman catholic church of jesus christ in madagascar lutheran and anglican and has been an influential force in malagasy politics.164 cultureedit each of the many ethnic sub-groups in madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities however there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island creating a strongly unified malagasy cultural identity in addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors the traditional malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana solidarity vintana destiny tody karma and hasina a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision strong kinship ties a widespread belief in the power of magic diviners astrology and witch doctors and a traditional division of social classes into nobles commoners and slaves.20162 although social castes are no longer legally recognized ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status economic opportunity and roles within the community.166 malagasy people traditionally consult mpanandro makers of the days to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or famadihana according to a traditional astrological system introduced by arabs similarly the nobles of many malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ombiasy from olona-be-hasina man of much virtue of the southeastern antemoro ethnic group who trace their ancestry back to early arab settlers.167 the diverse origins of malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions the most emblematic instrument of madagascar the valiha is a bamboo tube zither carried to madagascar by early settlers from southern borneo and is very similar in form to those found in indonesia and the philippines today.168 traditional houses in madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern borneo in terms of symbolism and construction featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.169 reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material typically stone and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.170 the production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers and madagascar's national dress the woven lamba has evolved into a varied and refined art.171 the southeast asian cultural influence is also evident in malagasy cuisine in which rice is consumed at every meal typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.172 african influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth traditions originating on the african mainland cattle rustling originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.70 artsedit a wide variety of oral and written literature has developed in madagascar one of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its oratory as expressed in the forms of hainteny poetry kabary public discourse and ohabolana proverbs.173174 an epic poem exemplifying these traditions the ibonia has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional malagasy communities.175 this tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as jean-joseph rabearivelo who is considered africa's first modern poet176 and elie rajaonarison an exemplar of the new wave of malagasy poetry.177 madagascar has also developed a rich musical heritage embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal salegy or highland hiragasy that enliven village gatherings local dance floors and national airwaves.178 additionally madagascar also has a growing culture of classical music fostered through youth academies organizations and orchestras that promote youth involvement in classical music the plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island in addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats baskets purses and hats.140 wood carving is a highly developed art form with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods aloalo funerary posts and wooden sculptures many of which are produced for the tourist market.179 the decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage in 2008.180 among the antaimoro people the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.179 embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.140 a small but growing number of fine art galleries in antananarivo and several other urban areas offer paintings by local artists and annual art events such as the hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in madagascar.181 sport and recreationedit a number of traditional pastimes have emerged in madagascar moraingy a type of hand-to-hand combat is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions it is traditionally practiced by men but women have recently begun to participate.182 the wrestling of zebu cattle which is named savika or tolon-omby is also practiced in many regions.183 in addition to sports a wide variety of games are played among the most emblematic is fanorona a board game widespread throughout the highland regions according to folk legend the succession of king andrianjaka after his father ralambo was partially due to the obsession that andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.184 because of its advanced sports facilities antananarivo gained the hosting rights for several of africa's top international basketball events including the 2011 fiba africa championship188 the 2009 fiba africa championship for women189 the 2014 fiba africa under-18 championship190 the 2013 fiba africa under-16 championship191 and the 2015 fiba africa under-16 championship for women.192 cuisineedit malagasy cuisine reflects the diverse influences of southeast asian african indian chinese and european culinary traditions the complexity of malagasy meals can range from the simple traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs throughout almost the entire island the contemporary cuisine of madagascar typically consists of a base of rice vary served with an accompaniment laoka the many varieties of laoka may be vegetarian or include animal proteins and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger onion garlic tomato vanilla coconut milk salt curry powder green peppercorns or less commonly other spices or herbs in parts of the arid south and west pastoral families may replace rice with maize cassava or curds made from fermented zebu milk a wide variety of sweet and savory fritters as well as other street foods are available across the island as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits locally produced beverages include fruit juices coffee herbal teas and teas and alcoholic drinks such as rum wine and beer.172 three horses beer is the most popular beer on the island193 and is considered emblematic of madagascar.194 the island also produces some of the world's finest chocolate chocolaterie robert established in 1940 is the most famous chocolate company on the island.195 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit template:islands of africa 15th century 16th century 15th century 16th century 17th century 18th century 19th century 16th

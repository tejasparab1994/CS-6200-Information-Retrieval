nasa president dwight d eisenhower established nasa in 195810 with a distinctly civilian rather than military orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science the national aeronautics and space act was passed on july 29 1958 disestablishing nasa's predecessor the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca the new agency became operational on october 1 1958.1112 since that time most us space exploration efforts have been led by nasa including the apollo moon landing missions the skylab space station and later the space shuttle currently nasa is supporting the international space station and is overseeing the development of the orion multi-purpose crew vehicle the space launch system and commercial crew vehicles the agency is also responsible for the launch services program lsp which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned nasa launches nasa science is focused on better understanding earth through the earth observing system13 advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the science mission directorate's heliophysics research program14 exploring bodies throughout the solar system with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as new horizons15 and researching astrophysics topics such as the big bang through the great observatories and associated programs.16 nasa shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the greenhouse gases observing satellite since 2011 nasa has been criticized for low cost efficiency achieving little results in return for high development costs.171819  contents  creation it is of great urgency and importance to our country both from consideration of our prestige as a nation as well as military necessity that this challenge sputnik be met by an energetic program of research and development for the conquest of space.. it is accordingly proposed that the scientific research be the responsibility of a national civilian agency.. naca is capable by rapid extension and expansion of its effort of providing leadership in space technology.21 while this new federal agency would conduct all non-military space activity the advanced research projects agency arpa was created in february 1958 to develop space technology for military application.22 staff and leadership the agency's leader nasa's administrator is nominated by the president of the united states subject to approval of the us senate and reports to him or her and serves as senior space science advisor though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan the appointee usually is associated with the president's political party democratic or republican and a new administrator is usually chosen when the presidency changes parties the only exceptions to this have been james c fletcher appointed by republican richard nixon but stayed through may 1977 into the term of democrat jimmy carter daniel goldin appointed by republican george h w bush and stayed through the administration of democrat bill clinton and robert m lightfoot jr. associate administrator under democrat barack obama kept on as acting administrator by republican donald trump.6 though the agency is independent the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the president.27 the first administrator was dr t keith glennan appointed by republican president dwight d eisenhower during his term he brought together the disparate projects in american space development research.28 james fletcher was responsible for early planning of the space shuttle program during his first term as administrator under president nixon he was appointed for a second term as administrator from may 1986 through april 1989 by president ronald reagan to help the agency recover from the space shuttle challenger disaster the agency's administration is located at nasa headquarters in washington dc and provides overall guidance and direction.30 except under exceptional circumstances nasa civil service employees are required to be citizens of the united states.31 nasa advisory council in response to the apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967 congress directed nasa to form an aerospace safety advisory panel asap to advise the nasa administrator on safety issues and hazards in nasa's aerospace programs in the aftermath of the shuttle columbia accident congress required that the asap submit an annual report to the nasa administrator and to congress.32 by 1971 nasa had also established the space program advisory council and the research and technology advisory council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support in 1977 the latter two were combined to form the nasa advisory council nac.33 space flight programs nasa has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history unmanned programs launched the first american artificial satellites into earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system starting with venus and mars and including grand tours of the outer planets manned programs sent the first americans into low earth orbit leo won the space race with the soviet union by landing twelve men on the moon from 1969 to 1972 in the apollo program developed a semi-reusable leo space shuttle and developed leo space station capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-soviet russia some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects such as the galileo probe which was deployed by astronauts in earth orbit before being sent unmanned to jupiter manned programs shortly after the space race began an early objective was to get a person into earth orbit as soon as possible therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored the us air force's man in space soonest program considered many manned spacecraft designs ranging from rocket planes like the x-15 to small ballistic space capsules.38 by 1958 the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule.39 the soviet union ussr competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft vostok they sent the first man in space by launching cosmonaut yuri gagarin into a single earth orbit aboard vostok 1 in april 1961 one month before shepard's flight.43 in august 1962 they achieved an almost four-day record flight with andriyan nikolayev aboard vostok 3 and also conducted a concurrent vostok 4 mission carrying pavel popovich based on studies to grow the mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights developing space rendezvous techniques and precision earth landing project gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the soviets lead and to support the apollo manned lunar landing program adding extravehicular activity eva and rendezvous and docking to its objectives the first manned gemini flight gemini 3 was flown by gus grissom and john young on march 23 1965.44 nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966 demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days rendezvous docking and practical eva and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.4546 under the direction of soviet premier nikita khrushchev the ussr competed with gemini by converting their vostok spacecraft into a two or three-man voskhod they succeeded in launching two manned flights before gemini's first flight achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first eva in 1964 after this the program was canceled and gemini caught up while spacecraft designer sergei korolev developed the soyuz spacecraft their answer to apollo the u.s public's perception of the soviet lead in the space race by putting the first man into space motivated president john f kennedy to ask the congress on may 25 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s which effectively launched the apollo program.47 the second manned mission apollo 8 brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the moon in december 1968.52 shortly before the soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the moon.53 on the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the moon landing were practiced5455 and then finally the moon landing was made on the apollo 11 mission in july 1969.56 apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit and landing humans on another celestial body.59 apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low earth orbit to date the program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world notably at the smithsonian's air and space museums on may 24 1972 us president richard m nixon and soviet premier alexei kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other.62 this authorized the apollo-soyuz test project astp involving the rendezvous and docking in earth orbit of a surplus apollo command/service module with a soyuz spacecraft the mission took place in july 1975 this was the last us manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the space shuttle in april 1981.63 the space shuttle became the major focus of nasa in the late 1970s and the 1980s planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985 the first to launch columbia did so on april 12 198165 the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight.66 the shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters challenger in 1986 and columbia in 2003.71 while the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the space shuttle endeavour from replacement parts nasa did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.71 nasa's space shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the space shuttle atlantis at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 the program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.72 the station can be seen from the earth with the naked eye and as of 2017 is the largest artificial satellite in earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.86 the soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the iss they are the russian progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000 the european automated transfer vehicle atv since 2008 the japanese h-ii transfer vehicle htv since 2009 the american dragon spacecraft since 2012 and the american cygnus spacecraft since 2013 the space shuttle before its retirement was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay until another us manned spacecraft is ready crew members will travel to and from the international space station exclusively aboard the soyuz.87 the highest number of people occupying the iss has been thirteen this occurred three times during the late shuttle iss assembly missions.88 the iss program is expected to continue until at least 2020 and may be extended beyond 2028.89 the development of the commercial resupply services crs vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating american commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the iss.90 the development of these vehicles was under a fixed price milestone-based program meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they didn't receive until after they had successful completed the milestone.91 private companies were also required to have some skin in the game which refers raising an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal.92 on december 23 2008 nasa awarded commercial resupply services contracts to spacex and orbital sciences corporation.93 spacex uses its falcon 9 rocket and dragon spacecraft.94 orbital sciences uses its antares rocket and cygnus spacecraft the first dragon resupply mission occurred in may 2012.95 the first cygnus resupply mission occurred in september 2013.96 the crs program now provides for all america's iss cargo needs with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the european atv and the japanese htv.97 the commercial crew development ccdev program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating american commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the iss staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to earth.98 it is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-nasa customers to private space stations such those planned by bigelow aerospace.99 like cots ccdev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.91 dragon v2 computer rendering of cst-100 in orbit for missions beyond low earth orbit bleo nasa has been directed to develop the space launch system sls a saturn-v class rocket and the two to six person beyond low earth orbit spacecraft orion in february 2010 president barack obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the iss to private companies.104 during a speech at the kennedy space center on april 15 2010 obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle hlv to replace the formerly planned ares v.105 in his speech obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025 and a manned mission to mars orbit by the mid-2030s.105 the nasa authorization act of 2010 was passed by congress and signed into law on october 11 2010.106 the act officially canceled the constellation program.106 the authorization act required a newly designed hlv be chosen within 90 days of its passing the launch vehicle was given the name space launch system the new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft.107 the orion spacecraft which was being developed as part of the constellation program was chosen to fulfill this role.108 the space launch system is planned to launch both orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low earth orbit.109 the sls is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions the initial capability of sls is required to be able to lift 70 mt into leo it is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt.108110 exploration flight test 1 eft-1 an unmanned test flight of orion's crew module was launched on december 5 2014 atop a delta iv heavy rocket.110 exploration mission-1 em-1 is the unmanned initial launch of sls that would also send orion on a circumlunar trajectory which is planned for 2019.110 the first manned flight of orion and sls exploration mission 2 em-2 is to launch in 2022 it is a 10 to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into lunar orbit.110 em-3 is planned to deliver a crew of 4 to lunar orbit along with the first module of deep space gateway on june 5 2016 nasa and darpa announced plans to build a series of new x-planes over the next 10 years.111 one of the planes will reportedly be a supersonic vehicle that burns low-carbon biofuels and generates quiet sonic booms.111 nasa plans to build full scale deep space habitats such at the nautilus-x and deep space gateway as part of its next space technologies for exploration partnerships nextstep program.112 unmanned programs more than 1000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the earth and the solar system.113 besides exploration communication satellites have also been launched by nasa.114 the missions have been launched directly from earth or from orbiting space shuttles which could either deploy the satellite itself or with a rocket stage to take it farther the first us unmanned satellite was explorer 1 which started as an abma/jpl project during the early part of the space race it was launched in january 1958 two months after sputnik at the creation of nasa the explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day its missions have been focusing on the earth and the sun measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind among other aspects.115 a more recent earth mission not related to the explorer program was the hubble space telescope which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990.116 the inner solar system has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs the first was mariner in the 1960s and '70s which made multiple visits to venus and mars and one to mercury probes launched under the mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby mariner 2 to take the first pictures from another planet mariner 4 the first planetary orbiter mariner 9 and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver mariner 10 this is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.117 the first successful landing on mars was made by viking 1 in 1976 twenty years later a rover was landed on mars by mars pathfinder.118 outside mars jupiter was first visited by pioneer 10 in 1973 more than 20 years later galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet.119 pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit saturn in 1979 with voyager 2 making the first and so far only visits to uranus and neptune in 1986 and 1989 respectively the first spacecraft to leave the solar system was pioneer 10 in 1983 for a time it was the most distant spacecraft but it has since been surpassed by both voyager 1 and voyager 2.120 pioneers 10 and 11 and both voyager probes carry messages from the earth to extraterrestrial life.121122 communication can be difficult with deep space travel for instance it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the new horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to pluto.123 contact with pioneer 10 was lost in 2003 both voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the solar system and interstellar space.124 on november 26 2011 nasa's mars science laboratory mission was successfully launched for mars curiosity successfully landed on mars on august 6 2012 and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on mars.125126127 recent and planned activities the new horizons mission to pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of pluto on july 14 2015 the probe received a gravity assist from jupiter in february 2007 examining some of jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby on the horizon of nasa's plans is the maven spacecraft as part of the mars scout program to study the atmosphere of mars.128 on december 4 2006 nasa announced it was planning a permanent moon base.129 the goal was to start building the moon base by 2020 and by 2024 have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and in-situ resource utilization however in 2009 the augustine committee found the program to be on an unsustainable trajectory.130 in 2010 president barack obama halted existing plans including the moon base and directed a generic focus on manned missions to asteroids and mars as well as extending support for the international space station.131 since 2011 nasa's strategic goals have been132 in august 2011 nasa accepted the donation of two space telescopes from the national reconnaissance office despite being stored unused the instruments are superior to the hubble space telescope.133 in september 2011 nasa announced the start of the space launch system program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle the space launch system is intended to launch the orion multi-purpose crew vehicle and other elements towards the moon near-earth asteroids and one day mars.134 the orion mpcv conducted an unmanned test launch on a delta iv heavy rocket in december 2014.135 the james webb space telescope jwst is currently scheduled to launch in spring 2019.136 on august 6 2012 nasa landed the rover curiosity on mars on august 27 2012 curiosity transmitted the first pre-recorded message from the surface of mars back to earth made by administrator charlie bolden hello this is charlie bolden nasa administrator speaking to you via the broadcast capabilities of the curiosity rover which is now on the surface of mars scientific research nasa's aeronautics research mission directorate conducts aeronautics research nasa has made use of technologies such as the multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator mmrtg which is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator used on space missions.138 shortages of this material have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennia.139 an example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was new horizons 2.139 the earth science research program was created and first funded in the 1980s under the administrations of ronald reagan and george h.w bush.140141 climate study nasa also researches and publishes on climate issues.143 its statements concur with the interpretation that the global climate is heating.144 bob walker who has advised the 45th president of the united states donald trump on space issues has advocated that nasa should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as noaa.145 facilities nasa's facilities are research construction and communication centers to help its missions some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons nasa also operates a short-line railroad at the kennedy space center and own special aircraft for instance two boeing 747 that transport space shuttle orbiter john f kennedy space center ksc is one of the best-known nasa facilities it has been the launch site for every united states human space flight since 1968 although such flights are currently on pause ksc continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for america's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining cape canaveral air force station lyndon b johnson space center jsc in houston is home to the christopher c kraft jr mission control center where all flight control is managed for manned space missions jsc is the lead nasa center for activities regarding the international space station and also houses the nasa astronaut corps that selects trains and provides astronauts as crew members for us and international space missions another major facility is marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama at which the saturn 5 rocket and skylab were developed.146 the jpl worked together with abma one of the agencies behind explorer 1 the first american space mission the ten nasa field centers are numerous other facilities are operated by nasa including the wallops flight facility in wallops island virginia the michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana the white sands test facility in las cruces new mexico and deep space network stations in barstow california madrid spain and canberra australia budget nasa's budget has generally been approximately 1 of the federal budget from the early 1970s on after briefly peaking at approximately 4.41 in 1966 during the apollo program.27147 public perception of nasa's budget has differed significantly from reality a 1997 poll indicated that most americans responded that 20 of the federal budget went to nasa.148 environmental impact an example of nasa's environmental efforts is the nasa sustainability base additionally the exploration sciences building was awarded the leed gold rating in 2010.161 observations various nebulae observed from a nasa space telescope 1 ceres pluto spacecraft hardware comparison of apollo

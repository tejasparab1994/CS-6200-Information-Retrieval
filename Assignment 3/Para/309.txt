list of pacific hurricanes this is a list of notable pacific hurricanes subdivided by reason for notability notability means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative it includes lists and rankings of pacific hurricanes by different characteristics and impacts contents impactedit retired namesedit additionally adolph and israel were removed from the list of names during and after the 2001 season due to political sensitivities knut was removed from the list in 1988 for unknown reasons adele iva and fefa were also removed in 1970 1988 and 1991 respectively for unknown reasons hazel was replaced in 1965.1 the name isis was also pre-emptively removed from the lists of names for 2016 after being deemed inappropriate because of the eponymous militant group in 2015.2 unnamed but historically significantedit deadliest tropical cyclonesedit the following tropical cyclones have caused at least 100 deaths costliest tropical cyclonesedit seasonal activity and recordsedit in the central pacific hurricane center's cphc area of responsibility aor the season with the most tropical cyclones is the 2015 season with 16 cyclones forming in or entering the region a season without cyclones has happened a few times since 1966 most recently in 1979.30 highestedit lowestedit before 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable the geostationary satellite era began in 196631 and that year is often considered the first year of reliable tropical records.32 intensity estimates are most reliable starting in the 1971 season a few years later the dvorak technique came into use those two factors make intensity estimates more reliable starting in that year.32 for these reasons seasons prior to 1971 are not included naming historyedit naming of tropical cyclones in the eastern north pacific began in the 1960 season that year four lists of names were created the plan was to proceed in a manner similar to that of the western pacific that is the name of the first storm in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started this scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four-year rotation starting with the a name each year.33 that same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different on average the eastern north pacific sees about sixteen named storms per year.34 named storms per monthedit before 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable the geostationary satellite era began in 196631 and that year is often considered the first year of reliable tropical records.32 intensity estimates are more reliable starting in the 1971 season a few years later the dvorak technique came into use those two make intensity estimates more reliable starting in that year.32 for these reasons seasons before 1966 are not included in the lowest column  shared by more than five seasons source:35 off-season stormsedit the pacific hurricane season runs from may 15 to november 30.36 only systems that develop or enter during the off-season are included the earliest off-season storm is pali in 2016 whilst the latest off-season storm was nine-c during 2015 unnamed stormsedit tropical cyclones have received official names in the east-central pacific region since 1960 since this time 5 systems that have formed in this area have not received a name plus another possible unnamed subtropical or tropical system in 2006 strengthedit category 5edit category 4edit duration recordsedit all of these systems except trudy olaf and connie existed in both the east and central pacific and all except olaf were hurricanes hurricane trudy of 1990 is thus the longest lived eastern pacific hurricane to stay in the eastern pacific tropical storm olaf of 1997 is hence the longest-lived eastern pacific tropical cyclone not to reach hurricane intensity.35 before the weather satellite era began the lifespans of many pacific hurricanes may be underestimated.32 crossover stormsedit from atlantic to eastern pacificedit this includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossover it used to be that when a pacific named storm crossed north america and made it to the atlantic or vice versa it would receive the next name on the respective basin's list however in 2000 this policy was changed so that a tropical cyclone will keep its name if it remains a tropical cyclone during the entire passage only if it dissipates and then re-forms does it get renamed.59 from eastern pacific to atlanticedit this includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossover in addition to those there are apparently two additional ones one existed before 1856 and made it to the gulf of mexico.65 another pacific tropical cyclone crossed over central mexico and also made it to the gulf sometime after september 9 1924.65 from eastern pacific to western pacificedit  system ceased to be a tropical cyclone before crossing the dateline and subsequently reforming  hurricane li formed in the eastern pacific but was not named until it crossed into the central pacific in addition hurricane jimena of 2003 is recognized per nhc cphc and jtwc as a storm that existed in all three areas of responsibility but isn't recognized by the jma as a official western pacific tropical cyclone.727374 from western pacific to central pacificedit  system crossed the dateline twice  hurricane/typhoon john formed in the eastern pacific in addition typhoon june of 1958 and tropical storm wene of 2000 are recognized per cphc as basin-crossing storms but aren't recognized as such by the jma.8182 also tropical storm moke of 1984 may have achieved this feat as well however it isn't recognized as an official western pacific tropical cyclone by either the jma or the jtwc.7374 from central pacific to eastern pacificedit tropical cyclones crossing from the eastern pacific to the central pacific are routine ones going the other way are not that event has happened thrice intensity recordsedit ten most intenseedit per lowest central pressureedit the apparent increase in recent seasons is spurious it is due to better estimation and measurement not an increase in intense storms that is until 1988 pacific hurricanes generally did not have their central pressures measured or estimated from satellite imagery  estimated from satellite imagery  measured and adjusted  measured  pressure while east of the international dateline per highest sustained windsedit strongest landfallsedit strongest storm in each monthedit intensity is measured solely by central pressure unless the pressure is not known in which case intensity is measured by maximum sustained winds  this tropical

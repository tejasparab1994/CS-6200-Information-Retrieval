tropical cyclone track forecasting the forces that affect tropical cyclone steering are the higher-latitude westerlies the subtropical ridge and the beta effect caused by changes of the coriolis force within fluids such as the atmosphere accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high and low-pressure areas and predicting how those areas will migrate during the life of a tropical system computer forecast models are used to help determine this motion as far out as five to seven days in the future  contents  historyedit in 1937 radiosondes were used to aide tropical cyclone forecasting.2 the next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943 and the establishment of the hurricane hunters in 1944 in the 1950s coastal weather radars began to be used in the united states and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the hurricane research division began in 1954.3 the launch of the first weather satellite tiros-i in 1960 introduced new techniques to tropical cyclone forecasting that remain important to the present day in the 1970s buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements which until that point were not available at all over sea surfaces.3 single station forecasting of a tropical cyclone passageedit basicsedit fujiwhara effectedit trochoidal motionsedit forecast modelsedit length of forecast periodedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

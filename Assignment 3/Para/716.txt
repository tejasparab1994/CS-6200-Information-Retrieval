of a god called kitchikewana who was large enough to guard the whole of the georgian bay kitchikewana was known for his great temper and his tribe decided the best way to calm him was with a wife they held a grand celebration and many women came kitchikewana met a woman named wanakita here he decided that this was the woman he wanted to marry and started planning the wedding immediately after she left but when she was invited back she told kitchikewana that she was already engaged enraged kitchikewana destroyed all the decorations running to one end of beausoleil island and grabbing a large ball of earth running to the other end he tossed it into the great lakes thus the 30000 islands were created the indentations left behind by his fingers form the five bays of georgian bay midland bay

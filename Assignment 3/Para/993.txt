zvezda iss module the module was manufactured by rkk energia with major sub-contracting work by gknpts khrunichev.6 zvezda was launched on a proton rocket on july 12 2000 and docked with the zarya module on july 26  contents  originsedit the basic structural frame of zvezda known as dos-8 was initially built in the mid-1980s to be the core of the mir-2 space station this means that zvezda is similar in layout to the core module dos-7 of the mir space station it was in fact labeled as mir-2 for quite some time in the factory its design lineage thus extends back to the original salyut stations the space frame was completed in february 1985 and major internal equipment was installed by october 1986 the mir-2 space station was redesigned after the failure of the polyus orbital weapons platform core module to reach orbit zvezda is around 1/4 the size of polyus and has no armaments designedit the transfer compartment attaches to the zarya module and has docking ports intended for the science power platform and the universal docking module as in the early days of mir the transfer compartment provides a suitable eva airlock where spacewalkers in orlan suits removed a hatch after closing a few that connected the compartment to the rest of the station it was used only during expedition 2 where two men put a docking cone on the nadir port the lower port connects to pirs and the top port connects to poisk eventually the plan for pirs is for it to be deorbited and replaced by naukamultipurpose laboratory module the assembly compartment holds external equipment such as thrusters thermometers antennas and propellant tanks the transfer chamber is equipped with automatic docking equipment and is used to service soyuz and progress spacecraft zvezda can support up to six crew6 including separate sleeping quarters for two cosmonauts at a time.6 it also has a nasa-provided treadmill with vibration isolation system and a bicycle for exercise a toilet and other hygiene facilities and a galley with a refrigerator and freezer the module contains the primary russian computers for guidance and navigation zvezda also contains the elektron system that electrolyzes condensed humidity and waste water to provide hydrogen and oxygen the hydrogen is expelled into space and the oxygen is used for breathing air the condensed water and the waste water can be used for drinking in an emergency but ordinarily fresh water from earth is used there are 16 small thrusters and two large s5.79 thrusters for propulsion the oxidizer used for the propulsion system is dinitrogen tetroxide and the fuel is udmh the supply tanks being pressurised with nitrogen.8 additionally it has eight batteries for storing power the elektron system has required significant maintenance work having failed several times and requiring the crew to use the solid fuel oxygen generator canisters also called oxygen candles which were the cause of a fire on mir when it has been broken for extended amounts of time it also contains the vozdukh a system which removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas zvezda has been criticized for being excessively noisy and the crew has been observed wearing earplugs inside it zvezda contains the esa's digital management system a computer that controls iss.9 zvezda is also the home of the lada greenhouse which is a test for growing plants in space.10 connection to the issedit the rocket used for launch to the iss carried advertising it was emblazoned with the logo of pizza hut restaurants111213 for which they are reported to have paid more than us$1 million.14 the money helped support khrunichev state research and production space center and the russian advertising agencies that orchestrated the event.15 on july 26 2000 zvezda became the third component of the iss when it docked at the aft port of zarya zarya had already been attached to the u.s unity module. later in july the computers aboard zarya handed over iss commanding functions to computers on zvezda.16 on september 11 2000 two members of the sts-106 space shuttle crew completed final connections between zvezda and zarya during a 6-hour 14 minute eva astronaut ed lu and cosmonaut yuri malenchenko connected nine cables between zvezda and zarya including four power cables four video and data cables and a fiber-optic telemetry cable.17 the next day sts-106 crew members floated into zvezda for the first time at 05:20 utc on september 12 2000.18 the two main engines on zvezda can be used to raise the station's altitude this was done on april 25 2007 this was the first time the engines had been fired since zvezda arrived in 2000.20 launch risksedit due to russian financial problems zvezda was launched with no backup and no insurance due to this risk nasa had constructed an interim control module in case it was delayed significantly or destroyed on launch interioredit zvezda's space

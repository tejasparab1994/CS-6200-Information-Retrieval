toxin toxins can be small molecules peptides or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors toxins vary greatly in their toxicity ranging from usually minor such as a bee sting to almost immediately deadly such as botulinum toxin  contents  terminologyedit according to an international committee of the red cross review of the biological weapons convention toxins are poisonous products of organisms unlike biological agents they are inanimate and not capable of reproducing themselves and since the signing of the constitition there have been no disputes among the parties regarding the definition of biological agents or toxins.4 according to title 18 of the united states code .. the term toxin means the toxic material or product of plants animals microorganisms including but not limited to bacteria viruses fungi rickettsiae or protozoa or infectious substances or a recombinant or synthesized molecule whatever their origin and method of production...5 a rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable on a broader scale toxins may be classified as either exotoxins being excreted by an organism or endotoxins that are released mainly when bacteria are lysed biotoxinsedit the term biotoxin is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin.67 biotoxins are further classified into fungal biotoxins or short mycotoxins microbial biotoxins plant biotoxins short phytotoxins and animal biotoxins toxins produced by microorganisms are important virulence determinants responsible for microbial pathogenicity and/or evasion of the host immune response.8 biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism and can be highly complex the venom of the cone snail contains dozens of small proteins each targeting a specific nerve channel or receptor or relatively small protein biotoxins in nature have two primary functions some of the more well known types of biotoxins include environmental toxinsedit the term environmental toxin can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants9 such as industrial pollutants and other artificially made toxic substances as this contradicts most formal definitions of the term toxin it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts environmental toxins from food chains that may be dangerous to human health include finding information about toxinsedit the toxicology and environmental health information program tehip20 at the united states national library of medicine nlm maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by tehip and by other government agencies and organizations this web site includes links to databases bibliographies tutorials and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources tehip also is responsible for the toxicology data network toxnet21 an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web toxmap is a geographic information system gis that is part of toxnet toxmap uses maps of the united states to help users visually explore data from the united states environmental protection agency's epa toxics release inventory and superfund basic research programs computational resources for prediction of toxic peptides and proteinsedit one of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity recently in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins developed by gajendra pal singh raghava's group22 predict toxicity with reasonably good accuracy the prediction models are based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides the prediction tool is freely accessible to public in the form of web server.23 misuse of the termedit when used non-technically the term toxin is often applied to any toxic substance even though the term toxicant would be more appropriate toxic substances not directly of biological origin are also termed poisons and many non-technical and lifestyle journalists follow this usage to refer to toxic substances in general.clarification needed in the context of quackery and alternative medicine the term toxin is used to refer to any substance alleged to cause ill health this could range from trace amounts of potentially dangerous pesticides to supposedly harmful substances produced in the body by intestinal fermentation auto-intoxication to food ingredients such as table sugar monosodium glutamate msg and aspartame.24 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

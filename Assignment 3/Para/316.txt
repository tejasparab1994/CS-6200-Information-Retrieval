banqiao dam  contents  historyedit cracks in the dam and sluice gates appeared after completion due to construction and engineering errors they were repaired with the advice from soviet engineers and the new design dubbed the iron dam was considered unbreakable 1975 banqiao dam floodedit communication with the dam was largely lost due to wire failures on august 6 a request to open the dam was rejected because of the existing flooding in downstream areas on august 7 the request was accepted but the telegrams failed to reach the dam.7 the sluice gates were not able to handle the overflow of water partially due to sedimentation blockage.8 on august 7 at 21:30 the people's liberation army unit 34450 by name the 2nd artillery division in residence at queshan county which was deployed on the banqiao dam sent the first dam failure warning via telegraph on august 8 at 1:00 water at the banqiao crested at the 117.94 m level above sea level or 0.3 meter higher than the wave protection wall on the dam and it failed the same storm caused the failure of 62 dams in total the runoff of banqiao dam was 13000 m3 per second in vs 78800 m3 per second out and as a result 701 million m3 of water were released in 6 hours4 while 1.67 billion m3 of water were released in 5.5 hours at an upriver shimantan dam and 15.738 billion m3 of water were released in total to protect other dams from failure several flood diversion areas were evacuated and inundated and several dams were deliberately destroyed by air strikes to release water in desired directions the nihewa and laowangpo flood diversion areas downstream of the dams soon exceeded their capacity and gave up part of their storage on august 8 forcing more flood diversion areas to begin to evacuate the dikes on the quan river collapsed in the evening of august 9 and the entire linquan county in fuyang anhui was inundated as the boshan dam with a capacity of 400 million m3 crested and the water released from the failures of banqiao and shimantan was rushing downstream air strikes were made against several other dams to protect the suya lake dam already holding 1.2 billion m3 of water.10 suya lake won only a temporary reprieve as both it and boshan became eventual targets finally the bantai dam holding 5.7 billion m3 of water was bombed.11 after the flood a summit of national flood prevention and reservoir security at zhengzhou henan was held by the department of water conservancy and electricity and a nationwide reservoir security examination was performed chen xing was again brought back to the project casualtiesedit according to the hydrology department of henan province approximately 26000 people died in the province14 from flooding and another 145000 died during subsequent epidemics and famine in addition about 5960000 buildings collapsed and 11 million residents were affected unofficial estimates of the number of people killed by the disaster have run as high as 230000 people.15 the death toll of this disaster was declassified in 2005.4 reconstructionedit within eleven years of the dam failure the lower reach of the river ru esp zhumadian city experienced several more disastrous floods after many feasibility studies the new banqiao reservoir reconstruction was listed as a key national project of the seventh five-year plan of china the project owner was huai river water resources commission the construction contractor was changjiang gezhouba engineering bureau by the end of 1986 the rebuilding project commenced on june 5 1993 the project was certified by the chinese government legacyedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

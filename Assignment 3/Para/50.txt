fire whirl a fire whirl  also commonly known as a fire devil or in many cases erroneously as a fire tornado firenado or fire twister  is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash they usually start with a whirl of wind or smoke fire whirls may occur when intense rising heat and turbulent wind conditions combine to form whirling eddies of air these eddies can contract into a tornado-like vortex that sucks in burning debris and combustible gases fire whirls are sometimes colloquially called fire tornadoes but are not usually classifiable as tornadoes as the vortex in most cases does not extend from the surface to cloud base also even in such cases even those fire whirls are not classic tornadoes in that their vorticity derives from surface winds and heat-induced lifting rather than a tornadic mesocyclone aloft the literal fire tornado is a rare phenomenon much more powerful and destructive than the a typical fire whirl in which the wildfire generates a pyrocumulonimbus cloud that then spawns a tornado when this tornado forms in or enters the fire zone it fans flames enormously draws flame and burning debris into itself and scatters burning debris over a wide area  contents  formationedit most of the largest fire whirls are spawned from wildfires they form when a warm updraft and convergence from the wildfire are present.2 they are usually 10-50 meters tall a few meters wide and last only a few minutes however some can be more than a kilometer tall contain winds over 160 km/h and persist for more than 20 minutes.3 examplesedit another example is the numerous large fire whirls some tornadic that developed after lightning struck an oil storage facility near san luis obispo california on 7 april 1926 several of which produced significant structural damage well away from the fire killing two many whirlwinds were produced by the four-day-long firestorm coincident with conditions that produced severe thunderstorms in which the larger fire whirls carried debris 5 kilometers away.6 classificationedit there are currently three known types of fire whirls:8 there is evidence suggesting that the fire whirl in the hifukusho-ato area during the great kanto earthquake of 1923 was of type 3.9 referencesedit notesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

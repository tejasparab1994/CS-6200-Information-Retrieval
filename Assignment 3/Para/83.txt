weather forecasting weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change once a human-only endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure current weather conditions and sky condition weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many atmospheric factors into account.1 human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involves pattern recognition skills teleconnections knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the inaccuracy of forecasting is due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere the error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes hence forecasts become less accurate as the difference between current time and the time for which the forecast is being made the range of the forecast increases the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome there are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture and therefore to traders within commodity markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and wind chill forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them in 2014 the us spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.2 contents historyedit ancient forecastingedit ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events also termed pattern recognition for example it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red the following day often brought fair weather this experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore however not allwhich? of these predictions prove reliable and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.9 modern methodsedit beaufort developed the wind force scale and weather notation coding which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life he also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around british shores and with his friend william whewell expanded weather record-keeping at 200 british coast guard stations robert fitzroy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the board of trade to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to mariners this was the forerunner of the modern meteorological office.15 all ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose.16 a storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the royal charter inspired fitzroy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made which he called forecasting the weather thus coining the term weather forecast.16 fifteen land stations were established to use the new telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service his warning service for shipping was initiated in february 1861 with the use of telegraph communications the first daily weather forecasts were published in the times in 1861.15 in the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected.17 the weather book which fitzroy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time as the electric telegraph network expanded allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings a national observational network was developed which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from kew observatory  these cameras had been invented by francis ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by fitzroy.1819 to convey accurate information it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by luke howard in 1802 and standardized in the international cloud atlas of 1896 numerical predictionedit it was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction in 1922 english scientist lewis fry richardson published weather prediction by numerical process20 after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in world war i he described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found broadcastsedit the first ever daily weather forecasts were published in the times on august 1 1861 and the first weather maps were produced later in the same year.26 in 1911 the met office began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission these included gale and storm warnings for areas around great britain.27 in the united states the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by edward b e.b. rideout on weei the edison electric illuminating station in boston.28 rideout came from the u.s weather bureau as did wbz weather forecaster g harold noyes in 1931 the world's first televised weather forecasts including the use of weather maps were experimentally broadcast by the bbc in 1936 this was brought into practice in 1949 after world war ii george cowling gave the first weather forecast while being televised in front of the map in 1954.2930 in america experimental television forecasts were made by james c fidler in cincinnati in either 1940 or 1947 on the dumont television network.2831 in the late 1970s and early 80s john coleman the first weatherman on abc-tv's good morning america pioneered the use of on-screen weather satellite information and computer graphics for television forecasts.32 coleman was a co-founder of the weather channel twc in 1982 twc is now a 24-hour cable network some weather channels have started broadcasting on live broadcasting programs such as youtube and periscope to reach more viewers one meteorologist jeff matthews transformed the medium from forecasting live during television broadcasts to forecasting live on periscope under the name of weathertainment becoming the first meteorologist to deliver daily forecasts on a life-streaming application...and thus making weather forecasting interactive for the public how models create forecastsedit the basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future the main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea the world meteorological organization acts to standardize the instrumentation observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide stations either report hourly in metar reports33 or every six hours in synop reports.34 sites launch radiosondes which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere.35 data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available.363738 compared with similar data from radiosondes the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage however at a lower accuracy and resolution.39 meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time.40 additionally if a pulse doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.41 models are initialized using this observed data the irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms usually an evenly spaced grid the data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast.46 commonly the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations these equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined the rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future the equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future this time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time the length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid techniquesedit persistenceedit the simplest method of forecasting the weather persistence relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow this can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state such as during the summer season in the tropics this method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern therefore when in a fluctuating weather pattern this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate it can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.60 use of a barometeredit looking at the skyedit along with pressure tendency the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future at night high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain.63 morning fog portends fair conditions as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation the approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future.64 a bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone the use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.65 nowcastingedit the forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting.66 in this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model a human given the latest radar satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours.67 however there are now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation including evolution of those features in time use of forecast modelsedit in the past the human forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations.68 today human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters such as model biases and performance.69 using a consensus of forecast models as well as ensemble members of the various models can help reduce forecast error.70 however regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run.71 humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast while increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecast process at some point in the future there is currently still a need for human intervention.72 analog techniqueedit quality assessmentedit mathematical models are often developed to map the forecast skill of a weather prediction methodology communicating forecasts to the publicedit most end users of forecasts are members of the general public thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths power outages77 and widespread hail damage heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still78 as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas.79 excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories to the public in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way examples include the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's national weather service nws80 and environment canada's meteorological service msc.81 traditionally newspaper television and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public increasingly the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found.82 in all cases these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis severe weather alerts and advisoriesedit a major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected this is done to protect life and property.83 some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch other forms of these advisories include winter weather high wind flood tropical cyclone and fog.84 severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media including radio using emergency systems as the emergency alert system which break into regular programming.85 low temperature forecastedit the low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7pm that evening through 7am the following morning.86 so in short today's forecasted low is most likely tomorrow's low temperature specialist forecastingedit there are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users air trafficedit because the aviation industry is especially sensitive to the weather accurate weather forecasting is essential fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off.87 turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards.88 thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries89 icing due to the heavy precipitation as well as large hail strong winds and lightning all of which can cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight.90 volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds.91 on a day-to-day basis airliners are routed to take advantage of the jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency.92 aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination.93 additionally airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind this reduces the distance required for takeoff and eliminates potential crosswinds.94 marineedit commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed wave periodicity and heights tides and precipitation these factors can each influence the safety of marine transit consequently a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio for example the mafor marine forecast.95 typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of rtty navtex and radiofax agricultureedit farmers rely on weather forecasts to decide what work to do on any particular day for example drying hay is only feasible in dry weather prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton wheat96 and corn crops while corn crops can be ruined by drought their dried remains can be used as a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage.97 frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall for example peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze.98 orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes regardless of their timing.99 forestryedit weather forecasting of wind precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling wildfires different indices like the forest fire weather index and the haines index have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather too utility companiesedit other commercial companiesedit increasingly private companies pay for weather forecasts tailored to their needs so that they can increase their profits or avoid large losses.104 for example supermarket chains may change the stocks on their shelves in anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market such as futures in oranges corn soybeans and oil.105 military applicationsedit united kingdom armed forcesedit royal navy the uk royal navy working with the uk met office has its own specialist branch of weather observers and forecasters as part of the hydrographic and meteorological hm specialisation who monitor and forecast operational conditions across the globe to provide accurate and timely weather and oceanographic information to submarines ships and fleet air arm aircraft royal air forceedit a mobile unit in the raf working with the uk met office forecasts the weather for regions in which british allied servicemen and women are deployed a group based at camp bastion provides forecasts for the british armed forces in afghanistan.106 united states armed forcesedit us navyedit similar to the private sector military weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter community military weather forecasters provide pre-flight and in-flight weather briefs to pilots and provide real time resource protection services for military installations naval forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts the united states navy provides a special service to both themselves and the rest of the federal government by issuing forecasts for tropical cyclones across the pacific and indian oceans through their joint typhoon warning center.107 us air forceedit within the united states air force weather provides weather forecasting for the air force and the army air force forecasters cover air operations in both wartime and peacetime operations and provide army support;108 united states coast guard marine science technicians provide ship forecasts for ice breakers and other various operations within their realm;109 and marine forecasters provide support for ground and air-based united states marine corps operations.110 all four military branches take their initial enlisted meteorology technical training at keesler air force base.111 military and civilian forecasters actively cooperate in analyzing

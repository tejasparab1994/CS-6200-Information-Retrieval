1900 galveston hurricane  contents  deadliest us hurricaneedit the hurricane occurred before the practice of assigning official code names to tropical storms was instituted and thus it is commonly referred to under a variety of descriptive names typical names for the storm include the galveston hurricane of 1900 the great galveston hurricane and especially in older documents the galveston flood it is often referred to by galveston locals as the great storm or the 1900 storm meteorological historyedit three days later antigua reported a severe thunderstorm passing over followed by the hot humid calmness that often occurs after the passage of a tropical cyclone by september 1 u.s weather bureau observers were reporting on a storm of moderate intensity not a hurricane southeast of cuba continuing westward the storm made landfall on southwest cuba on september 3 dropping heavy rains on september 5 it emerged into the florida straits as a tropical storm or a weak hurricane.9 the weather bureau ignored reports from cuban meteorologists because they expected the storm to curve northeast along the coast of north america assumption became fact as the official government reports stated wrongly that the storm was traveling northeast in the atlantic. however a region of high pressure had pushed the storm to the west into the gulf of mexico.10 backgroundedit a quarter of a century earlier the nearby town of indianola on matagorda bay was undergoing its own boom and was second to galveston among texas port cities then in 1875 a powerful hurricane blew through nearly destroying the town indianola was rebuilt though a second hurricane in 1886 caused residents to simply give up and move elsewhere.15 many galveston residents took the destruction of indianola as an object lesson on the threat posed by hurricanes galveston is built on a low flat island little more than a large sandbar along the gulf coast these residents proposed a seawall be constructed to protect the city but their concerns were dismissed by the majority of the population and the city's government.16 since its formal founding in 1839 the city of galveston had weathered numerous storms all of which the city survived with ease residents believed any future storms would be no worse than previous events.17 in order to provide an official meteorological statement on the threat of hurricanes galveston weather bureau section director isaac cline wrote an 1891 article in the galveston daily news in which he argued not only that a seawall was not needed to protect the city but also that it would be impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike the island.18 the seawall was not built and development activities on the island actively increased its vulnerability to storms sand dunes along the shore were cut down to fill low areas in the city removing what little barrier there was to the gulf of mexico.19 preparationsedit on september 4 the galveston office of the national weather bureau as it was then called began receiving warnings from the bureau's central office in washington d.c. that a tropical storm had moved northward over cuba the weather bureau forecasters had no way of knowing where the storm was or where it was going at the time they discouraged the use of terms such as tornado or hurricane to avoid panicking residents in the path of any storm event conditions in the gulf of mexico were ripe for further strengthening of the storm the gulf had seen little cloud cover for several weeks and the seas were as warm as bathwater according to one report for a storm system that feeds off moisture the gulf of mexico was enough to boost the storm from a tropical storm to a hurricane in a matter of days with further strengthening likely.9 weather bureau forecasters believed the storm would travel northeast and affect the mid-atlantic coast to them the storm appeared to have begun a long turn or 'recurve that would take it first into florida then drive it northeast toward an eventual exit into the atlantic.20 cuban forecasters adamantly disagreed saying the hurricane would continue west one cuban forecaster predicted the hurricane would continue into central texas near san antonio early the next morning the swells continued despite only partly cloudy skies largely because of the unremarkable weather few residents heeded the warning few people evacuated across galveston's bridges to the mainland and the majority of the population was unconcerned by the rain clouds that began rolling in by midmorning isaac cline claimed that he took it upon himself to travel along the beach and other low-lying areas warning people personally of the storm's approach.21 these reports by cline and his brother galveston meteorologist joseph l cline22 have been called into question in recent years as no other survivors corroborated these accounts in fact cline's role in the disaster is the subject of some controversy supporters point to cline's issuing a hurricane warning without permission from the bureau's central office;23 detractors including author erik larson point to cline's earlier insistence that a seawall was unnecessary and his belief that an intense hurricane could not strike the island impactedit united statesedit texas evacueesedit ten refugees from the beaumont train sought shelter at the point bolivar lighthouse with 200 residents of port bolivar who were already there the 85 who stayed with the train died when the storm surge overran the tops of the cars.26 galvestonedit the dead bodies were so numerous that burying all of them was impossible the dead were initially weighted down on barges and dumped at sea but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach a new solution was needed.35 funeral pyres were set up on the beaches or wherever dead bodies were found and burned day and night for several weeks after the storm the authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead.26 more people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the united states since this count is greater than 300 cyclones as of 2009 the galveston hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in u.s history.36 midwestedit new york cityedit closer to the waterfront along the battery seawall waves and tides were reported to be some of the highest in recent memory of the fishermen and sailors spray and debris were thrown over the wall making working along the waterfront dangerous small craft in new york harbor were thrown off course and tides and currents in the hudson river made navigation difficult in brooklyn the new york times reported that trees were uprooted signs and similar structures were blown down and yachts were torn from moorings with some suffering severe damage because of the direction of the wind coney island escaped the fury of the storm though a bathing pavilion at bath beach suffered damage from wind and waves.38 canadaedit aftermathedit in less than 24 hours the city of galveston was effectively obliterated the final death toll is not known with certainty but the most conservative estimate is around 6000 most historians believe the loss of life to be in the area of 8000 with some suggesting as many as 12000 perished with the city in ruins and rail lines to the mainland destroyed the survivors had little to live on until relief arrived.43 rebuildingedit survivors set up temporary shelters in surplus u.s army tents along the shore they were so numerous that observers began referring to galveston as the white city on the beach others constructed so-called storm lumber homes using salvageable material from the debris to build shelter.44 reporter winifred bonfils a young journalist working for william randolph hearst was the first reporter on the line at the flood's aftermath she delivered an exclusive set of reports and hearst sent relief supplies by train.45 by september 12 galveston received its first post-storm mail the next day basic water service was restored and western union began providing minimal telegraph service within three weeks cotton was again being shipped out of the port.28 before the hurricane of 1900 galveston was considered to be a beautiful and prestigious city and was known as the ellis island of the west and the wall street of the southwest.46 however after the storm development shifted north to houston which was enjoying the benefits of the oil boom the dredging of the houston ship channel in 1909 and 1914 ended galveston's hopes of regaining its former status as a major commercial center.47 protectionedit the galveston city government was reorganized into a commission government a newly devised structure wherein the government is made of a small group of commissioners each responsible for one aspect of governance this was prompted by fears that the existing city council would be unable to handle the problem of rebuilding the city the last reported survivor of the galveston hurricane of 1900 mrs maude conic of wharton texas died november 14 2004 at the claimed age of 11649 although the 1910 census and other records indicate she was younger than that.50 historiographyedit museumedit the

history of tropical cyclone naming the practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries with storms named after places saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in each basin examples of such names are the 1928 okeechobee hurricane and the 1938 new england hurricane the system currently in place provides identification of tropical cyclones in a brief form that is easily understood and recognized by the public the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named tropical cyclones and anticyclones between 1887 and 1907 this system of naming fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific over the following decades formal naming schemes were introduced for several tropical cyclone basins including the north and south atlantic eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian ocean  contents  formal start of namingedit after reading about clement wragge george stewart was inspired to write a novel storm about a storm affecting california which was named maria.57 the book was widely read after it was published in 1941 by random house especially by united states army air corps and united states navy usn meteorologists during world war ii.15 during 1944 united states army air forces forecasters usaaf at the newly established saipan weather center started to informally name typhoons after their wives and girlfriends.58 this practise became popular amongst meteorologists from the united states airforce and navy who found that it reduced confusion during map discussions and in 1945 the united states armed services publicly adopted a list of women's names for typhoons of the pacific.57 however they were not able to persuade the united states weather bureau uswb to start naming atlantic hurricanes as the weather bureau wanted to be seen as a serious enterprise and thus felt that it was not appropriate to name tropical cyclones while warning the united states public.159 they also felt that using women's names was frivolous and that using the names in official communications would have made them look silly.9 during 1947 the air force hurricane office in miami started using the joint army/navy phonetic alphabet to name significant tropical cyclones in the north atlantic ocean.5 these names were used over the next few years in private/internal communications between weather centres and aircraft and were not included in public bulletins.15 new millenniumedit during the 30th session of the escap/wmo typhoon committee in november 1997 a proposal was put forward by hong kong to give asian typhoons local names and to stop using the european and american names that had been used since 1945.4344 the committee's training and research coordination group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session.4344 during august 1998 the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names.44 it was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name.44 a list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the typhoon committee's 32nd session who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on january 1 2000.444546 it was also decided that the japan meteorological agency would name the systems rather than the joint typhoon warning center.4447 during its annual session in 2000 the wmo/escap panel on north indian tropical cyclones agreed in principle to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the north indian ocean.48 as a result of this the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur by the end of 2000.49 at the 2001 session the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved only india had refused to submit a list of names as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones.49 the panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of names.49 during 2002 the rapporteur reported that there had been a poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names over the next year each country except india submitted a fresh list.49 by the 2004 session india had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so however the rapporteur presented the lists of names that would be used with a gap left for india's names.49 the rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season starting in may or june 2004.49 the naming lists were then completed in may 2004 after india submitted their names.50 however the lists were not used until september 2004 when the first tropical cyclone was named onil by the india meteorological department imd.4850 at its twenty-first session in 2015 the ra i tropical cyclone committee reviewed the arrangements for naming tropical storms and decided that the procedure was in need of a very urgent change.73 in particular it was noted that the procedure did not take into account any of the significant improvements in the science surrounding tropical cyclones and that it was biased due to inappropriate links with some national warning systems.73 as a result the committee decided to keep the current naming procedure for the next few years and form a task force in order to develop an alternative cyclone naming procedure.73 the taskforce could not meet during the intersessional pierod but planned to meet during the twenty-second session during 2017 modern dayedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

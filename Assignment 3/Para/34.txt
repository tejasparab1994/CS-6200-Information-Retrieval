supercell supercells are often put into three classification types classic low-precipitation lp and high-precipitation hp lp supercells are usually found in climates that are more arid such as the high plains of the united states and hp supercells are most often found in moist climates supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right pre-existing weather conditions but they are most common in the great plains of the united states in an area known as tornado alley and in the tornado corridor of argentina uruguay and southern brazil  contents  characteristicsedit supercells are usually found isolated from other thunderstorms although they can sometimes be embedded in a squall line typically supercells are found in the warm sector of a low pressure system propagating generally in a north easterly direction in line with the cold front of the low pressure system because they can last for hours they are known as quasi-steady-state storms supercells have the capability to deviate from the mean wind if they track to the right or left of the mean wind relative to the vertical wind shear they are said to be right-movers or left-movers respectively supercells can sometimes develop two separate updrafts with opposing rotations which splits the storm into two supercells one left-mover and one right-mover supercells can be any size  large or small low or high topped they usually produce copious amounts of hail torrential rainfall strong winds and substantial downbursts supercells are one of the few types of clouds that typically spawn tornadoes within the mesocyclone although only 30 or fewer do so.3 geographyedit supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right weather conditions the first storm to be identified as the supercell type was the wokingham storm over england which was studied by keith browning and frank ludlam in 1962.4 browning did the initial work that was followed up by lemon and doswell to develop the modern conceptual model of the supercell.5 to the extent that records are available supercells are most frequent in the great plains of the central united states and southern canada extending into the southeastern u.s and northern mexico east-central argentina and adjacent regions of uruguay bangladesh and parts of eastern india south africa and eastern australia.6 supercells occur occasionally in many other mid-latitude regions including eastern china and throughout europe the areas with highest frequencies of supercells are similar to those with the most occurrences of tornadoes see tornado climatology and tornado alley anatomy of a supercelledit the current conceptual model of a supercell was described in severe thunderstorm evolution and mesocyclone structure as related to tornadogenesis by leslie r lemon and charles a doswell iii see lemon technique supercells derive their rotation through tilting of horizontal vorticity an invisible horizontal vortex caused by wind shear strong updrafts lift the air turning about a horizontal axis and cause this air to turn about a vertical axis this forms the deep rotating updraft the mesocyclone a cap or capping inversion is usually required to form an updraft of sufficient strength the cap puts an inverted warm-above-cold layer above a normal cold-above-warm boundary layer and by preventing warm surface air from rising allows one or both of the following this creates a warmer moister layer below a cooler layer which is increasingly unstable because warm air is less dense and tends to rise when the cap weakens or moves explosive development follows in north america supercells usually show up on doppler radar as starting at a point or hook shape on the southwestern side fanning out to the northeast the heaviest precipitation is usually on the southwest side ending abruptly short of the rain-free updraft base or main updraft not visible to radar the rear flank downdraft or rfd carries precipitation counterclockwise around the north and northwest side of the updraft base producing a hook echo that indicates the presence of a mesocyclone structure of a supercelledit overshooting topedit this dome feature appears above the strongest updraft location on the anvil of the storm it is a result of a very powerful updraft enough to break through the upper levels of the troposphere an observer who is at ground level too close to the storm is unable to see the overshooting top due to the fact that the anvil blocks the sight of this feature the overshooting is visible from satellite images as a bubbling amidst the otherwise smooth upper surface of the anvil cloud anviledit precipitation-free baseedit this area typically on the southern side of the storm in north america is relatively precipitation free this is located beneath the main updraft and is the main area of inflow while no precipitation may be visible to an observer large hail may be falling from this area a region of this area is called the vault it is more accurately called the main updraft area wall cloudedit the wall cloud forms near the downdraft/updraft interface this interface is the area between the precipitation area and the precipitation-free base wall clouds form when rain-cooled air from the downdraft is pulled into the updraft this wet cold air quickly saturates as it is lifted by the updraft forming a cloud that seems to descend from the precipitation-free base wall clouds are common and are not exclusive to supercells only a small percentage actually produce a tornado but if a storm does produce a tornado it usually exhibits wall clouds that persist for more than ten minutes wall clouds that seem to move violently up or down and violent movements of cloud fragments scud or fractus near the wall cloud are indications that a tornado could form mammatus cloudsedit mammatus mamma mammatocumulus are bulbous or pillow-like cloud formations extending from beneath the anvil of a thunderstorm these clouds form as cold air in the anvil region of a storm sinks into warmer air beneath it mammatus are most apparent when they are lit from one side or below and are therefore at their most impressive near sunset or shortly after sunrise when the sun is low in the sky mammatus are not exclusive to supercells and can be associated with developed thunderstorms and cumulonimbus forward flank downdraft ffdedit this is generally the area of heaviest and most widespread precipitation for most supercells the precipitation core is bounded on its leading edge by a shelf cloud that results from rain-cooled air within the precipitation core spreading outward and interacting with warmer moist air from outside of the cell between the precipitation-free base and the ffd a vaulted or cathedral feature can be observed in high precipitation supercells an area of heavy precipitation may occur beneath the main updraft area where the vault would alternately be observed with classic supercells rear flank downdraft rfdedit the rfd of a supercell is a very complex and not yet fully understood feature rfd mainly occur within classic and hp supercells although rfds have been observed within lp supercells the rfd of a supercell is believed to play a large part in tornadogenesis by further tightening rotation within the surface mesocyclone rfds are caused by mid level steering winds of a supercell colliding with the updraft tower and moving around it in all directions specifically the flow that is redirected downward is referred to as the rfd this downward surge of relatively cool mid level air due to interactions between dew points humidity and condensation of the converging of air masses can reach very high speeds and is known to cause widespread wind damage the radar signature of an rfd is a hook like structure where sinking air has brought with it precipitation vaultedit a vault is not observed with all supercells the vault can only be identified visibly due to it visibly appearing to be free of precipitation but usually containing large hail on doppler radar the region of very high precipitation echos with a very sharp gradient perpendicular to the rfd flanking lineedit a flanking line is a line of smaller cumulonimbi or cumulus that form in the warm rising air pulled in by the main updraft due to convergence and lifting along this line landspouts sometimes occur on the outflow boundary of this region radar features of a supercelledit the hook echo is the area of confluence between the main updraft and the rear flank downdraft rfd this indicates the position of the mesocyclone and probably a tornado this is a region of low radar reflectivity bounded above by an area of higher radar reflectivity with an untilted updraft this is evidence of a strong updraft and oftentimes the presence of a tornado a notch of weak reflectivity on the inflow side of the cell this is not a v-notch a v shaped notch on the leading edge of the cell opening away from the main downdraft this is an indication of divergent flow around a powerful updraft this three body scatter spike is a region of weak echoes found radially behind the main reflectivity core at higher elevations when large hail is present.7 supercell variationsedit supercell thunderstorms are sometimes classified by meteorologists and storm spotters into three categories however not all supercells fit neatly into any one category being hybrid storms and many supercells may fall into different categories during different periods of their lifetimes the standard definition given above is referred to as the classic supercell all types of supercells typically produce severe weather low precipitation lpedit this type of supercell may be easily identifiable with sculpted cloud striations in the updraft base or even a corkscrewed or barber pole appearance on the updraft and sometimes an almost anorexic look compared to classic supercells this is because they often form within drier moisture profiles often initiated by dry lines leaving lps with little available moisture despite high mid-to-upper level environmental winds they most often dissipate rather than turning into classic or hp supercells although it is still not unusual for lps to do the latter especially when moving into a much moister air mass lps were first formally described by howard bluestein in the early 1980s11 although storm chasing scientists noticed them throughout the 1970s.12 classic supercells may wither yet maintain updraft rotation as they decay becoming more like the lp type in a process known as downscale transition that also applies to lp storms and this process is thought to be how many lps dissipate.13 lp supercells rarely spawn tornadoes and those that form tend to be weak small and high based tornadoes but strong tornadoes have been observed these storms although generating lesser precipitation amounts and producing smaller precipitation cores can generate huge hail lps may produce hail larger than baseballs in clear air where no rainfall is visible.14 lps are thus hazardous to people and animals caught outside as well as to storm chasers and spotters due to the lack of a heavy precipitation core lp supercells often exhibit relatively weak radar reflectivity without clear evidence of a hook echo when in fact they are producing a tornado at the time lp supercells may not even be recognized as supercells in reflectivity data unless one is trained or experienced on their radar characteristics.15 this is where observations by storm spotter and storm chasers may be of vital importance in addition to doppler velocity and polarimetric radar data high-based shear funnel clouds sometimes form midway between the base and the top of the storm descending from the main cb cumulonimbus cloud.citation needed lightning discharges may be less frequent compared to other supercell types but on occasion lps are prolific sparkers and the discharges are more likely to occur as intracloud lightning rather than cloud-to-ground lightning.citation needed in north america these storms most prominently form in the semi-arid great plains during the spring and summer months moving east and southeast they often collide with moist air masses from the gulf of mexico leading to the formation of hp supercells in areas just to the west of interstate 35 before dissipating or coalescing into squall lines at variable distances farther east lp supercells have been observed as far east as illinois and indiana16 however lp supercells can occur as far north as montana north dakota and even in the prairie provinces of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba in canada they have also been observed by storm chasers in australia and argentina the pampas.citation needed lp supercells are quite sought after by storm chasers because the limited amount of precipitation makes sighting tornadoes at a safe distance much less difficult than with a classic or hp supercell and more so because of the unobscured storm structure unveiled during spring and early summer areas in which lp supercells are readily spotted include southwestern oklahoma and northwestern texas among other parts of the western great plains.citation needed high precipitation hpedit the hp supercell has a much heavier precipitation core that can wrap all the way around the mesocyclone these are especially dangerous storms since the mesocyclone is wrapped with rain and can hide a tornado if present from view these storms also cause flooding due to heavy rain damaging downbursts and weak tornadoes although they are also known to produce strong to violent tornadoes they have a lower potential for damaging hail than classic and lp supercells although damaging hail is possible it has been observed by some spotters that they tend to produce more cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning than the other types also unlike the lp and classic types severe events usually occur at the front southeast of the storm the hp supercell is the most common type of supercell in the united states east of interstate 35 in the southern parts of the provinces of ontario and quebec in canada and in the central portions of argentina and uruguay mini-supercell or low-topped supercelledit whereas classic hp and lp refer to different precipitation regimes and mesoscale frontal structures another variation was identified in the early 1990s by jon davies.17 these smaller storms were initially called mini-supercells18 but are now commonly referred to as low-topped supercells these are also subdivided into classic hp and lp types effectsedit supercells can produce large hail damaging winds deadly tornadoes flooding dangerous cloud-to-ground lightning and heavy rain severe events associated with a supercell almost always occur in the area of the updraft/downdraft interface in the northern hemisphere this is most often the rear flank southwest side of the precipitation area in lp and classic supercells but sometimes the leading edge southeast side of hp supercells note that none of these severe events are exclusive to supercells although these events are highly predictable once a supercell has formed examplesedit the supercell is a global phenomenon appearing in places all over the world in slightly varying forms asiaedit australiaedit on april 14 1999 a severe storm later classified as a supercell hit the east coast of new south wales it is estimated that the storm dropped 500000 tonnes 490000 long tons 550000 short tons worth of hailstones during its course at the time it was the most costly disaster in australia's insurance history causing an approximated a$2.3 billion worth of damage of which a$1.7 billion was covered by insurance on february 27 2007 a supercell hit canberra dumping nearly thirty-nine centimetres 15 inches of ice in civic the ice was so heavy that a newly built shopping center's roof collapsed birds were killed in the hail produced from the supercell and people were stranded the following day many homes in canberra were subjected to flash flooding caused either by storm water infrastructure's inability to cope or through mud slides from cleared land.24 on november 27 2014 a supercell hit the inner city suburbs including the cbd of brisbane hailstones up to softball size cut power to 71000 properties injuring 39 people28 and causing a damage bill of $1 billion aud 29 a wind gust of 141 km/h was recorded at archerfield airport 30 south americaedit europeedit a third supercell affected the north east region of england the storm struck the tyneside area directly and without warning during evening rush hour causing widespread damage and travel chaos with people abandoning cars and being trapped due to lack of public transport flooded shopping malls were evacuated newcastle station was shut as was the tyne  wear metro and main road routes were flooded leading to massive tailbacks 999 land line services were knocked out in some areas and the damage ran to huge amounts only visible the next day after water cleared many parts of county durham and northumberland were also affected with thousands of homes across the north east left without power due to lightning strikes lightning was seen to hit the tyne bridge newcastle in europe the mini-supercell or low-topped supercell is very common especially when showers and thunderstorms develop in cooler polar air masses with a strong jet stream above especially in the left exit-region of a jetstreak north americaedit the tornado alley is a region of the central united states where severe weather is common particularly tornadoes supercell thunderstorms can affect this region at any time of the year but they are most common in the spring tornado watches and warnings are frequently necessary in the spring and summer most places from the great plains to the east coast of the united states and north as far as the canadian prairies the great lakes region and the st lawrence river will experience one or more supercells each year.citation needed gainesville georgia was the site of the fifth deadliest tornado in u.s history in 1936 where gainesville was devastated and 203 people were killed.33 the 1980 grand island tornado outbreak affected the city of grand island nebraska on june 3 1980 seven tornadoes touched down in or near the city that night killing 5 and injuring 200.34 the elie manitoba tornado was an f5 that struck the town of elie manitoba on june 22 2007 while several houses were leveled no one was injured or killed by the tornado.353637 a massive tornado outbreak on may 3 1999 spawned an f5 tornado in the area of oklahoma city that had the highest recorded winds on earth.38 this outbreak spawned over 66 tornadoes in oklahoma alone on this day throughout the area of oklahoma kansas and texas over 141 tornadoes were produced this outbreak resulted in 50 fatalities and 895 injuries.citation needed south africaedit south africa witnesses several supercell thunderstorms each year with the inclusion of isolated tornadoes on most occasions these tornadoes occur in open farmlands and rarely cause damage to property as such many of the tornadoes which do occur in south africa are not reported the majority of supercells develop in the central northern and north eastern parts of the country the free state gauteng and kwazulu natal are typically the provinces where these storms are most commonly experienced though supercell activity is not limited to these provinces on occasion hail reaches sizes in excess of golf balls and tornadoes though rare also occur on 6 may 2009 a well-defined hook echo was noticed on local south african radars along with satellite imagery this supported the presence of a strong supercell storm reports from the area indicated heavy rains winds and large hail.43 on october 2 2011 two devastating tornadoes tore through two separate parts of south africa on the same day hours apart from each other the first classified as an ef2 hit meqheleng the informal settlement outside ficksburg free state which devastated shacks and homes uprooted trees and killed one small child the second which hit the informal settlement of duduza nigel in the gauteng province also classified as ef2 hit hours apart from the one that struck ficksburg this tornado completely devastated parts of the informal settlement and killed two children destroying shacks and rdp homes.4445 galleryedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces

hypercane  contents  descriptionedit mechanismedit a hurricane functions as a carnot heat engine powered by the temperature difference between the sea and the uppermost layer of the troposphere as air is drawn in towards the eye it acquires latent heat from evaporating sea-water which is then released as sensible heat during the rise inside the eyewall and radiated away at the top of the storm system the energy input is balanced by energy dissipation in a turbulent boundary layer close to the surface which leads to an energy balance equilibrium.citation needed however in emanuel's model if the temperature difference between the sea and the top of the troposphere is too large there is no solution to the equilibrium equation as more air is drawn in the released heat reduces the central pressure further the lower the pressure the more heat is drawn in leading to a runaway process the actual limit to hypercane intensity depends on other energy dissipation factors that are uncertain whether inflow ceases to be isothermal whether shock waves would form in the outflow around the eye or whether turbulent breakdown of the vortex happens.58 see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

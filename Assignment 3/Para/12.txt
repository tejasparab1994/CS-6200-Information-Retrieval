winter winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate climates winter does not occur in tropical climates it occurs after autumn and before spring in each year winter is caused by the axis of the earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the sun different cultures define different dates as the start of winter and some use a definition based on weather when it is winter in the northern hemisphere it is summer in the southern hemisphere and vice versa in many regions winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures the moment of winter solstice is when the sun's elevation with respect to the north or south pole is at its most negative value that is the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole meaning this day will have the shortest day and the longest night the earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice however and these depend on latitude due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the earth's elliptical orbit see earliest and latest sunrise and sunset  contents  etymologyedit the english word winter comes from the proto-indo-european root wend relating to water.1 causeedit the tilt of the earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather the earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44 to the plane of its orbit causing different latitudes to directly face the sun as the earth moves through its orbit this variation brings about seasons when it is winter in the northern hemisphere the southern hemisphere faces the sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the northern hemisphere conversely winter in the southern hemisphere occurs when the northern hemisphere is tilted more toward the sun from the perspective of an observer on the earth the winter sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer sun during winter in either hemisphere the lower altitude of the sun causes the sunlight to hit that hemisphere at an oblique angle in regions experiencing winter the same amount of solar radiation is spread out over a larger area this effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat compared with these effects the changes in the distance of the earth from the sun are negligible meteorological reckoningedit astronomical and other calendar-based reckoningedit in the northern hemisphere some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points i.e based solely on the position of the earth in its orbit around the sun regardless of weather conditions in one version of this definition winter begins at the winter solstice and ends at the vernal equinox.12 these dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter  usually considered to span the entirety of december january and february in the northern hemisphere and june july and august in the southern.13 astronomically the winter solstice being the day of the year which has fewest hours of daylight ought to be in the middle of the season1415 but seasonal lag means that the coldest period normally follows the solstice by a few weeks in some cultures the season is regarded as beginning at the solstice and ending on the following equinox1617  in the northern hemisphere depending on the year this corresponds to the period between 21 or 22 december and 19 20 or 21 march in the uk meteorologists consider winter to be the three coldest months of december january and february.18 in scandinavia winter in one tradition begins on 14 october and ends on the last day of february.19 in russia currently calendar winter starts on 1 december and lasts through to the end of february though traditionally it was reckoned from the christmas 25 december in julian calendar or 7 january in gregorian until the annunciation 25 march in julian.20 in many countries in the southern hemisphere including australia2122 new zealand and south africa winter begins on 1 june and ends on 31 august in celtic nations such as ireland using the irish calendar and in scandinavia the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter with the winter season beginning 1 november on all hallows or samhain winter ends and spring begins on imbolc or candlemas which is 1 or 2 february this system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively the three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during november december and january in the northern hemisphere and may june and july in the southern hemisphere. also many mainland european countries tend to recognize martinmas or st martin's day 11 november as the first calendar day of winter.23 the day falls at midpoint between the old julian equinox and solstice dates also valentine's day 14 february is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring such as flowers blooming the three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late november or early december in the northern hemisphere and lasts through late february or early march this thermological winter is earlier than the solstice delimited definition but later than the daylight celtic definition depending on seasonal lag this period will vary between climatic regions cultural influences such as christmas creep may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years although high latitude countries like canada are usually well into their real winters before the december solstice ecological reckoning and activityedit ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates it is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year the other ecological seasons being prevernal vernal estival serotinal and autumnal.24 the hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the earth the appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late january in mild temperate climates to survive the harshness of winter many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for overwintering some annual plants never survive the winter other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle this is known as vernalization as for perennials many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it larger plants particularly deciduous trees usually let their upper part go dormant but their roots are still protected by the snow layer few plants bloom in the winter one exception being the flowering plum which flowers in time for chinese new year the process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called hardening exceptionally cold wintersedit other historically significant wintersedit humans and winteredit humans evolved in tropical climates and met cold weather as they migrated into eurasia although earlier populations certainly encountered southern hemisphere winters in southern africa micro-evolution in caucasian asiatic and inuit people show some adaptation to the climate winter and human healthedit humans are sensitive to cold see hypothermia snowblindness norovirus seasonal depression slipping on black ice and falling icicles are other health concerns associated with cold and snowy weather in the northern hemisphere it is not unusual for homeless people to die from hypothermia in the winter one of the most common diseases associated with winter is influenza symptoms include headache fever muscle pains sinus infection fatigue dizziness cough and loss of appetite mythologyedit in greek mythology hades kidnapped persephone to be his wife zeus ordered hades to return her to demeter the goddess of the earth and her mother however hades tricked persephone into eating the food of the dead so zeus decreed that persephone would spend six months with demeter and six months with hades during the time her daughter is with hades demeter became depressed and caused winter in welsh mythology gwyn ap nudd abducted a maiden named creiddylad on may day her lover gwythr ap greidawl fought gwyn to win her back the battle between them

global warming global warming also referred to as climate change is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the earth's climate system and its related effects.12 multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming.345 many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid-19th century and in paleoclimate proxy records covering thousands of years.6 future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region.1314 anticipated effects include increasing global temperatures rising sea levels changing precipitation and expansion of deserts in the subtropics.15 warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the arctic with the continuing retreat of glaciers permafrost and sea ice other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves droughts heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall;16 ocean acidification and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels.1718 because the climate system has a large inertia and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time many of these effects will persist for not only decades or centuries but for tens of thousands of years to come.19 public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing a global 2015 pew research center report showed that a median of 54 of all respondents asked consider it a very serious problem significant regional differences exist with americans and chinese whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual co2 emissions among the least concerned.25  contents  observed temperature changes the warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations as documented by many independent scientific groups.32 examples include sea level rise33 widespread melting of snow and land ice34 increased heat content of the oceans32 increased humidity32 and the earlier timing of spring events35 e.g. the flowering of plants.36 the probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero.32 regional trends and short-term fluctuations the thermal inertia of the oceans and the slow responses of other indirect effects occasion the climate to take centuries or longer to adjust to past changes in forcings one climate commitment study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000 levels surface temperatures would still increase by about one-half degree celsius42 and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005 levels surface warming could exceed a whole degree celsius some of this surface warming will be driven by past natural forcings which are still seeking equilibrium in the climate system one study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64 of the committed 2050 surface warming and their influence will fade with time compared to the human contribution.43 global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends and can temporarily mask them the relative stability in surface temperature from 2002 to 2009 which has since been dubbed the global warming hiatus by the media and some scientists44 is an example of such an episode.4546 2015 updates to account for differing methods of measuring ocean surface temperature measurements show a positive trend over the recent decade.4748 warmest years vs overall trend initial causes of temperature changes external forcings by itself the climate system may generate random changes in global temperatures for years to decades at a time but long-term changes emanate only from so-called external forcings.515253 these forcings are external to the climate system but not necessarily external to earth.54 examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere e.g. increased concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in earth's orbit around the sun.55 greenhouse gases the greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planet's atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface it was proposed by joseph fourier in 1824 discovered in 1860 by john tyndall56 was first investigated quantitatively by svante arrhenius in 189657 and its scientific description was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by guy stewart callendar.5859 human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to increased radiative forcing from co2 methane tropospheric ozone cfcs and nitrous oxide according to work published in 2007 the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by 36 and 148 respectively since 1750.65 these levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800000 years the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores.66676869 less direct geological evidence indicates that co2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago.70 fossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in co2 from human activity over the past 20 years the rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use particularly deforestation.71 another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic co2 emissions is the calcination of limestone for clinker production a chemical process which releases co2.72 estimates of global co2 emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion including cement production and gas flaring was 34.8 billion tonnes 9.5  0.5 pgc an increase of 54 above emissions in 1990 coal burning was responsible for 43 of the total emissions oil 34% gas 18% cement 4.9 and gas flaring 0.7%.73 in may 2013 it was reported that readings for co2 taken at the world's primary benchmark site in mauna loa surpassed 400 ppm according to professor brian hoskins this is likely the first time co2 levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years.7475 monthly global co2 concentrations exceeded 400 ppm in march 2015 probably for the first time in several million years.76 on 12 november 2015 nasa scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years currently about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere.77 over the last three decades of the twentieth century gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions.78 co2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.7980:71 emissions can be attributed to different regions attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty.8182:289 the popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion i.e. the destruction of stratospheric ozone e.g. the ozone layer by chlorofluorocarbons.8889 although there are a few areas of linkage the relationship between the two is not strong reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect.90 aerosols and soot in addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation aerosols have indirect effects on the earth's radiation budget sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets a phenomenon known as the twomey effect.97 this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight known as the albrecht effect.98 indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.99 soot may either cool or warm earth's climate system depending on whether it is airborne or deposited atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface in isolated areas with high soot production such as rural india as much as 50 of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds.100 when deposited especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface.101 the influences of atmospheric particles including black carbon are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics particularly in asia while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere.102 solar activity since 1978 solar irradiance has been measured by satellites.105 these measurements indicate that the sun's radiative output has not increased since then so the warming that occurred in the past 40 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the earth climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.106 models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when only taking into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity models are however able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings consisting of both human influences and natural forcings another line of evidence for the sun's non-attributability is the differing temperature changes at different levels in the earth's atmosphere.107 according to basic physical principles the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere but cooling of the upper atmosphere the stratosphere.108109 if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected.110 variations in earth's orbit feedback the climate system includes a range of feedbacks which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing while negative feedbacks reduce it.119 there are a range of feedbacks in the climate system including water vapour changes in ice-albedo snow and ice cover affect how much the earth's surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight clouds and changes in the earth's carbon cycle e.g. the release of carbon from soil.120 the main negative feedback is the energy the earth's surface radiates into space as infrared radiation.121 according to the stefan-boltzmann law if the absolute temperature as measured in kelvins doublese radiated energy increases by a factor of 16 2 to the 4th power.122 feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations other factors being equal a higher climate sensitivity means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing.123 uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario more research is needed to understand the role of clouds119 and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections.124 the ipcc projections previously mentioned span the likely range greater than 66 probability based on expert judgement125 for the selected emissions scenarios however the ipcc's projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty.126 the lower end of the likely range appears to be better constrained than the upper end.126 an observation based study on future climate change on the soil carbon feedback conducted since 1991 in harvard suggests release of about 190 petagrams of soil carbon the equivalent of the past two decades of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning until 2100 from the top 1-meter of earth's soils due to changes in microbial communities under elevated temperatures.127128 climate models do not account for this possible feedback mechanism climate models a climate model is a representation of the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system.131 such models are based on scientific disciplines such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics as well as physical processes such as radiative transfer the models may be used to predict a range of variables such as local air movement temperature clouds and other atmospheric properties ocean temperature salt content and circulation ice cover on land and sea the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere and chemical and biological processes among others although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model's climate sensitivity for example the uncertainty in ipcc's 2007 projections is caused by 1 the use of multiple models126 with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations132 2 the use of differing estimates of humanity's future greenhouse gas emissions126 3 any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models ipcc used to prepare its report i.e. greenhouse gas releases from permafrost.133 the models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes warming or cooling is thus a result not an assumption of the models.134 clouds and their effects are especially difficult to predict improving the models representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current research.135 another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon cycle.136137138 models are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.55 the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.139 climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century but do not simulate all aspects of climate.140 not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the ipcc observed arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted.141 precipitation increased proportionally to atmospheric humidity and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict.142143 since 1990 sea level has also risen considerably faster than models predicted it would.144 observed and expected environmental effects anthropogenic forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes including sea level rise changes in climate extremes such as the number of warm and cold days declines in arctic sea ice extent glacier retreat and greening of the sahara.147148 detection is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense without providing a reason for that change detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause attribution of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence.154 detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical ecological and social systems.155 extreme weather changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land with most warming at high northern latitudes and least warming over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic ocean.156 future changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions.157 projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events such as heat waves.158 a 2015 study published in nature climate change states data analysis of extreme events from 1960 until 2010 suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased frequency.161 extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased since 1980.162 sea level rise ecological systems in terrestrial ecosystems the earlier timing of spring events as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges have been linked with high confidence to recent warming.170 future climate change is expected to affect particular ecosystems including tundra mangroves coral reefs156 and caves.171 it is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric co2 levels combined with higher global temperatures.172 overall it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems.173 long-term effects on the timescale of centuries to millennia the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions.179 this is due to carbon dioxide's very long lifetime in the atmosphere.179 stabilizing the global average temperature would require large reductions in co2 emissions179 as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.179180 emissions of co2 would need to be reduced by more than 80 relative to their peak level.179 even if this were achieved global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many centuries.179 as of 2016 emissions of co2 from burning fossil fuels had stopped increasing but the guardian reports they need to be reduced to have a real impact on climate change meanwhile this greenhouse gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere.181 in that context the new york times reported that scientific installations analyzing oceanic air detected the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose at the highest rate on record in 2015 and 2016.182 it hs been suggested that this rise in co2 levels is the result of changing absorption patterns of the ocean and land surface in that they may have reached the limit of their ability to absorb carbon dioxide.182 long-term effects also include a response from the earth's crust due to ice melting and deglaciation in a process called post-glacial rebound when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice this could lead to landslides and increased seismic and volcanic activities tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor permafrost or releasing gas hydrates.184 some world regions such as the french alps already show signs of an increase in landslide frequency.185 large-scale and abrupt impacts climate change could result in global large-scale changes in natural and social systems.186 examples include the possibility for the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to slow or shutdown which in the instance of a shutdown would change weather in europe and north america considerably ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and the long-term melting of ice sheets which contributes to sea level rise.187 some large-scale changes could occur abruptly i.e. over a short time period and might also be irreversible examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost which would lead to amplified global warming or the shutdown of thermohaline circulation.188189 scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor.190 the probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be low.188191 factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming warming that occurs more rapidly and warming that is sustained over longer time periods.191 observed and expected effects on social systems the effects of climate change on human systems mostly due to warming or shifts in precipitation patterns or both have been detected worldwide production of wheat and maize globally has been impacted by climate change while crop production has increased in some mid-latitude regions such as the uk and northeast china economic losses due to extreme weather events have increased globally there has been a shift from cold to heat-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming livelihoods of indigenous peoples of the arctic have been altered by climate change and there is emerging evidence of climate change impacts on livelihoods of indigenous peoples in other regions regional impacts of climate change are now observable at more locations than before on all continents and across ocean regions.192 the future social impacts of climate change will be uneven.193 many risks are expected to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming.194 all regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts.195 low-latitude less developed areas face the greatest risk.196 a study from 2015 concluded that economic growth gross domestic product of poorer countries is much more impaired with projected future climate warming than previously thought.197 a meta-analysis of 56 studies concluded in 2014 that each degree of temperature rise will increase violence by up to 20% which includes fist fights violent crimes civil unrest or wars.198 examples of impacts include habitat inundation in small islands and mega deltas inundation as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements.206207 this could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low-lying areas such as bangladesh as well as statelessness for populations in countries such as the maldives and tuvalu.208 economy estimates based on the ipcc a1b emission scenario from additional co2 and ch4 greenhouse gases released from permafrost estimate associated impact damages by us$43 trillion.209 infrastructure continued permafrost degradation will likely result in unstable infrastructure in arctic regions or alaska before 2100 thus impacting roads pipelines and buildings as well as water distribution and cause slope failures.210 possible responses to global warming mitigation mitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb ghgs from the atmosphere.212 there is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency the use of low-carbon energy technologies such as renewable energy nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage;213214 and enhancing carbon sinks through for example reforestation and preventing deforestation.213214 a 2015 report by citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield positive return on investments.215 adaptation other policy responses include adaptation to climate change adaptation to climate change may be planned either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change or spontaneous i.e. without government intervention.220 planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis.213 the barriers limits and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood.213 a concept related to adaptation is adaptive capacity which is the ability of a system human natural or managed to adjust to climate change including climate variability and extremes to moderate potential damages to take advantage of opportunities or to cope with consequences.221 unmitigated climate change i.e. future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions would in the long term be likely to exceed the capacity of natural managed and human systems to adapt.222 environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.223 climate engineering climate engineering sometimes called geoengineering or climate intervention is the deliberate modification of the climate it has been investigated as a possible response to global warming e.g by nasa224 and the royal society.225 techniques under research fall generally into the categories solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal although various other schemes have been suggested a study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change.226 discourse about global warming political discussion most countries in the world are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc.229 the ultimate objective of the convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.230 as stated in the convention this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change food production is not threatened and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.231 the framework convention was agreed on in 1992 but global emissions have risen since then.232 during negotiations the g77 a lobbying group in the united nations representing 133 developing nations233:4 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to take the lead in reducing their emissions.234 this was justified on the basis that the developed world's emissions had contributed most to the cumulation of ghgs in the atmosphere per-capita emissions i.e. emissions per head of population were still relatively low in developing countries and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.82:290 this mandate was sustained in the kyoto protocol to the framework convention82:290 which entered into legal effect in 2005.235 in ratifying the kyoto protocol most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions these first-round commitments expired in 2012.235 united states president george w bush rejected the treaty on the basis that it exempts 80 of the world including major population centres such as china and india from compliance and would cause serious harm to the us economy.233:5 scientific discussion the discussion continues in scientific articles that are peer-reviewed and assessed by scientists who work in the relevant fields and participate in the intergovernmental panel on climate change the scientific consensus as of 2013 stated in the ipcc fifth assessment report is that it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.241 a 2008 report by the u.s national academy of sciences stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.79 in 2005 the royal society stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had tried to undermine the science and work of the ipcc.242 national science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions.243 in the scientific literature there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.244 no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.245246 discussion by the public and in popular media the global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature247248 regarding the nature causes and consequences of global warming the disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature especially since the mid-20th century whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations whether humankind has contributed significantly to it and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity predictions of additional warming and what the consequences of global warming will be by 1990 american conservative think tanks had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem they challenged the scientific evidence argued that global warming would have benefits and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good.249 some people dispute aspects of climate change science.242250 organizations such as the libertarian competitive enterprise institute conservative commentators and some companies such as exxonmobil have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls.251252253254 on the other hand some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years255 or even called for policies to reduce global warming.256 global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels.257 surveys of public opinion the global warming problem came to international public attention in the late 1980s polling groups began to track opinions on the subject at first mainly in the united states.258 the longest consistent polling by gallup in the us found relatively small deviations of 10 or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned.259 a 2010 survey of 14 industrialized countries found that skepticism about the danger of global warming was highest in australia norway new zealand and the united states in that order correlating positively with per capita emissions of carbon dioxide.265 etymology in the 1950s research suggested increasing temperatures and a 1952 newspaper reported climate change this phrase next appeared in a november 1957 report in the hammond times which described roger revelle's research into the effects of increasing human-caused co2 emissions on the greenhouse effect a large scale global warming with radical climate changes may result both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975 when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic climatic change are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming? the phrase began to come into common use and in 1976 mikhail budyko's statement that a global warming up has started was widely reported.266 other studies such as a 1971 mit report referred to the human impact as inadvertent climate modification but an influential 1979 national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures while describing the wider effects of increased co2 as climate change.267 in 1986 and november 1987 nasa climate scientist james hansen gave testimony to congress on global warming there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988 and when hansen testified in the senate on 23 june he sparked worldwide interest.268 he said global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.269 public attention increased over the summer and global warming became the dominant popular term commonly used both by the press and in public discourse.267 see also notes citations references further reading external

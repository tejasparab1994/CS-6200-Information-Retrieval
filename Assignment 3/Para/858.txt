service for many years and exactly equal to the official count for hurricane katrina older sources usually list 3411 as the hurricane's total count of fatalities including the caribbean however in 2003 the u.s death count was revised to at least 2500 making the okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in united states history behind the 1900 galveston hurricane a mass grave at the port mayaca cemetery east of port mayaca contains the bodies of 1600 victims of the hurricane.26 central and north floridaedit in fort myers property damage was slight limited mostly to scores of

around lake okeechobee such as belle glade chosen pahokee south bay and bean city.45 around 75 of the fatalities were among migrant farm workers most of whom were black the black workers did most of the post-hurricane cleanup work and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites.46 additionally the white victims received a proper burial at woodlawn cemetery in downtown west palm beach45 which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorial.46 in contrast the bodies of black victims were burned in funeral pyres or thrown into mass burial sites such

winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings buildings with well-constructed frames and those made of steel concrete brick or stone were largely immune to winds and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings coming on the heels of the 1926 miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.49 flood controledit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools

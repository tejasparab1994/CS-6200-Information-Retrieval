international standard book number the international standard book number isbn is a uniqueab numeric commercial book identifier an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a book for example an e-book a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different isbn the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007 and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007 the method of assigning an isbn is nation-based and varies from country to country often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country the initial isbn configuration of recognitionclarification needed was generated in 1967 based upon the 9-digit standard book numbering sbn created in 1966 the 10-digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 the sbn code can be converted to a ten digit isbn by prefixing it with a zero a book can be printed without a printed isbn if it is printed privately or the author does not follow the usual isbn procedure however this can be rectified later.1 another identifier the international standard serial number issn identifies periodical publications such as magazines and the international standard music number ismn covers for musical scores  contents  history the standard book numbering sbn code is a 9-digit commercial book identifier system created by gordon foster emeritus professor of statistics at trinity college dublin2 for the booksellers and stationers whsmith and others in 1965.3 the isbn configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 in the united kingdom by david whitaker4 regarded as the father of the isbn5 and in 1968 in the us by emery koltay4 who later became director of the u.s isbn agency r.r bowker.567 the 10-digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108.34 the united kingdom continued to use the 9-digit sbn code until 1974 iso has appointed the international isbn agency as the registration authority for isbn worldwide and the isbn standard is developed under the control of iso technical committee 46/subcommittee 9 tc 46/sc 9 the iso on-line facility only refers back to 1978.8 since 1 january 2007 isbns have contained 13 digits a format that is compatible with bookland european article number ean-13s.9 overview an isbn is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a book for example an ebook a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different isbn.10 the isbn is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 january 2007 and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007 an international standard book number consists of 4 parts if it is a 10 digit isbn or 5 parts for a 13 digit isbn a 13-digit isbn can be separated into its parts prefix element registration group registrant publication and check digit and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces separating the parts registration group registrant publication and check digit of a 10-digit isbn is also done with either hyphens or spaces figuring out how to correctly separate a given isbn is complicated because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.13 how isbns are issued isbn issuance is country-specific in that isbns are issued by the isbn registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded in canada isbns are issued at no cost with the stated purpose of encouraging canadian culture.14 in the united kingdom united states and some other countries where the service is provided by non-government-funded organisations the issuing of isbns requires payment of a fee australia isbns are issued by the commercial library services agency thorpe-bowker15 and prices range from $42 for a single isbn plus a $55 registration fee for new publishers to $2890 for a block of 1000 isbns access is immediate when requested via their website.16 brazil national library of brazil a government agency is responsible for issuing isbns and there is a cost of r$16 17 hong kong the books registration office bro under the hong kong public libraries issues isbns in hong kong there is no fee.18 india the raja rammohun roy national agency for isbn book promotion and copyright division under department of higher education a constituent of the ministry of human resource development is responsible for registration of indian publishers authors universities institutions and government departments that are responsible for publishing books.19 there is no fee associated in getting isbn in india.20 maldives the national bureau of classification nbc is responsible for isbn registrations for publishers who are publishing in the maldives.citation needed malta the national book council maltese il-kunsill nazzjonali tal-ktieb issues isbn registrations in malta.232425 morocco the national library of morocco is responsible for isbn registrations for publishing in morocco and moroccan-occupied portion of western sahara new zealand the national library of new zealand is responsible for isbn registrations for publishers who are publishing in new zealand.26 pakistan the national library of pakistan is responsible for isbn registrations for pakistani publishers authors universities institutions and government departments that are responsible for publishing books south africa the national library of south africa is responsible for isbn issuance for south african publishing institutions and authors united states in the united states the privately held company r.r bowker issues isbns.4 there is a charge that varies depending upon the number of isbns purchased with prices starting at $125 for a single number access is immediate when requested via their website.28 publishers and authors in other countries obtain isbns from their respective national isbn registration agency a directory of isbn agencies is available on the international isbn agency website registration group identifier within the 979 prefix element the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with international standard music numbers ismns but such material is not actually assigned an isbn.11 the registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for france 11 for the republic of korea and 12 for italy.32 the original 9-digit standard book number sbn had no registration group identifier but prefixing a zero 0 to a 9-digit sbn creates a valid 10-digit isbn registrant element the national isbn agency assigns the registrant element cf category:isbn agencies and an accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of its books in most countries a book publisher is not required by law to assign an isbn however most bookstores only handle isbn bearing publications.citation needed publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.34 here are some sample isbn-10 codes illustrating block length variations pattern for english language isbns english-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 2 of more than 220 registration group elements these two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern which allows their length to be determined as follows:35 check digits a check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit it consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number the method for the ten digit code is an extension of that for sbns the two systems are compatible and sbn prefixed with 0 will give the same check-digit as without  the digit is base eleven and can be 0-9 or x the system for thirteen digit codes is not compatible and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 10 digit isbn and does not provide the same protection against transposition this is because the thirteen digit code was required to be compatible with the ean format and hence could not contain an x isbn-10 check digits the 2001 edition of the official manual of the international isbn agency says that the isbn-10 check digit36  which is the last digit of the ten-digit isbn  must range from 0 to 10 the symbol x is used for 10 and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of 11 for example for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-2 formally using modular arithmetic we can say it is also true for isbn-10's that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10 is a multiple of 11 for this example formally we can say in contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered non-transposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid isbn although it is still unlikely isbn-10 check digit calculation for example the check digit for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615- is calculated as follows adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 132  12 x 11  this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so therefore the check digit has to be 2 and the complete sequence is isbn 0-306-40615-2 the valuex10displaystyle x_10 required to satisfy this condition might be 10 if so an 'x should be used alternatively modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11 the remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 i.e its value modulo 11 is computed this remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11 therefore the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11 modulo 11 taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0 without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11  0  11 which is invalid strictly speaking the first modulo 11 is unneeded but it may be considered to simplify the calculation. for example the check digit for the isbn-10 of 0-306-40615- is calculated as follows thus the check digit is 2 it is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples the modular reduction can be done once at the end as shown above in which case s could hold a value as large as 496 for the invalid isbn 99999-999-9-x or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition isbn-13 check digit calculation the 2005 edition of the international isbn agency's official manual38 describes how the 13-digit isbn check digit is calculated the isbn-13 check digit which is the last digit of the isbn must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its integer weight alternating between 1 and 3 is a multiple of 10 formally using modular arithmetic we can say the calculation of an isbn-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit isbn thus excluding the check digit itself each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9 subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10 a zero 0 replaces a ten 10 so in all cases a single check digit results for example the isbn-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615- is calculated as follows thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is isbn 978-0-306-40615-7 in general the isbn-13 check digit is calculated as follows let then additionally if the sum of the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th and 13th the total will always be divisible by 10 i.e. end in 0 isbn-10 to isbn-13 conversion the conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix 978 to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the isbn-13 algorithm errors in usage most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher the library of congress catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns which it usually tags with the phrase cancelled isbn.40 however book-ordering systems such as amazon.com will not search for a book if an invalid isbn is entered to its search engine.citation needed oclc often indexes by invalid isbns if the book is indexed in that way by a member library eisbn only the term isbn should be used the terms eisbn and e-isbn have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided if a book exists in one or more digital e-book formats each of those formats must have its own isbn in other words each of the three separate epub amazon kindle and pdf formats of a particular book will have its own specific isbn they should not share the isbn of the paper version and there is no generic eisbn which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.41 ean format used in barcodes and upgrading currently the barcodes on a book's back cover or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover are ean-13 they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the currency and the recommended retail price.42 for 10 digit isbns the number 978 the bookland country code is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the ean13 formula modulo 10 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories the international organization for standardization iso decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit isbn isbn-13 the process began 1 january 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 january 2007.43 as of 2011 all the 13-digit isbns began with 978 as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted the 979 prefix was introduced part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the musicland code for musical scores with an ismn 10 digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an m letter the bar code represents the m as a zero 0 and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3 all ismns are now 13 digits commencing 979-0 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by isbn publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same moreover the ten-digit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit isbn check digit because the gtin-13 is part of the global trade item number gtin system that includes the gtin-14 the gtin-12 and the gtin-8 the 13-digit isbn falls within the 14-digit data field range.44 barcode format compatibility is maintained because aside from the group breaks the isbn-13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing 10-digit isbns so migration to an ean-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing isbn based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems hence many booksellers e.g. barnes  noble migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005 although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read ean-13 barcodes before 2005 most general retailers could not read them the upgrading of the upc barcode system to full ean-13 in 2005 eased migration to the isbn-13 in north america see

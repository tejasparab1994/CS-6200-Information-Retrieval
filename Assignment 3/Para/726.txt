electricity electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of electric charge although initially considered a phenomenon separate from magnetism since the development of maxwell's equations both are recognized as part of a single phenomenon electromagnetism various common phenomena are related to electricity including lightning static electricity electric heating electric discharges and many others the presence of an electric charge which can be either positive or negative produces an electric field on the other hand the movement of electric charges which is known as electric current produces a magnetic field when a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field a force will act on it the magnitude of this force is given by coulomb's law thus if that charge were to move the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point in space which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts electricity is at the heart of many modern technologies being used for electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries even then practical applications for electricity were few and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use the rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society becoming a driving force for the second industrial revolution electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport heating lighting communications and computation electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.1  contents  history ancient cultures around the mediterranean knew that certain objects such as rods of amber could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers thales of miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 bce from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic in contrast to minerals such as magnetite which needed no rubbing.6789 thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity according to a controversial theory the parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating based on the 1936 discovery of the baghdad battery which resembles a galvanic cell though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.10 further work was conducted by otto von guericke robert boyle stephen gray and c f du fay.13 in the 18th century benjamin franklin conducted extensive research in electricity selling his possessions to fund his work in june 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky.14 a succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature.15 he also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior16 of the leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.13 the first solid-state device was the cat's-whisker detector first used in the 1900s in radio receivers a whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal such as a germanium crystal in order to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect.24 in a solid-state component the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it current flow can be understood in two forms as negatively charged electrons and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes these charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics the building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.2526 the solid-state device came into its own with the invention of the transistor in 1947 common solid-state devices include transistors microprocessor chips and ram a specialized type of ram called flash ram is used in usb flash drives and more recently solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes transistors integrated circuit ic and the light-emitting diode led concepts electric charge the presence of charge gives rise to an electrostatic force charges exert a force on each other an effect that was known though not understood in antiquity.21:457 a lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth if a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod it is found to repel the first the charge acts to force the two balls apart two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other however if one ball is charged by the glass rod and the other by an amber rod the two balls are found to attract each other these phenomena were investigated in the late eighteenth century by charles-augustin de coulomb who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms this discovery led to the well-known axiom like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.21 the force acts on the charged particles themselves hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface the magnitude of the electromagnetic force whether attractive or repulsive is given by coulomb's law which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an inverse-square relation to the distance between them.2728:35 the electromagnetic force is very strong second only in strength to the strong interaction29 but unlike that force it operates over all distances.30 in comparison with the much weaker gravitational force the electromagnetic force pushing two electrons apart is 1042 times that of the gravitational attraction pulling them together.31 electric current the movement of electric charge is known as an electric current the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes current can consist of any moving charged particles most commonly these are electrons but any charge in motion constitutes a current electric current can flow through some things electrical conductors but will not flow through an electrical insulator.36 by historical convention a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part current defined in this manner is called conventional current the motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit one of the most familiar forms of current is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons.37 however depending on the conditions an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction or even in both directions at once the positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation the process by which electric current passes through a material is termed electrical conduction and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling examples of electric currents include metallic conduction where electrons flow through a conductor such as metal and electrolysis where ions charged atoms flow through liquids or through plasmas such as electrical sparks while the particles themselves can move quite slowly sometimes with an average drift velocity only fractions of a millimetre per second28:17 the electric field that drives them itself propagates at close to the speed of light enabling electrical signals to pass rapidly along wires.38 electric field the concept of the electric field was introduced by michael faraday an electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field the electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses and like it extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance.30 however there is an important difference gravity always acts in attraction drawing two masses together while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge the electric field at a distance is usually zero thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe despite being much weaker.31 the study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics the field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field this concept was introduced by faraday43 whose term 'lines of force still sometimes sees use the field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines.43 field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties first that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges second that they must enter any good conductor at right angles and third that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.21:479 a hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface the field is therefore zero at all places inside the body.28:88 this is the operating principal of the faraday cage a conducting metal shell which isolates its interior from outside electrical effects the field strength is greatly affected by nearby conducting objects and it is particularly intense when it is forced to curve around sharply pointed objects this principle is exploited in the lightning conductor the sharp spike of which acts to encourage the lightning stroke to develop there rather than to the building it serves to protect46:155 electric potential electric potential is a scalar quantity that is it has only magnitude and not direction it may be viewed as analogous to height just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field so a charge will 'fall across the voltage caused by an electric field.48 as relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height a set of lines marking points of equal potential known as equipotentials may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object the equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles they must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface electromagnets this relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important for it led to michael faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821 faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting in a pool of mercury a current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury the magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire making it circle around the magnet for as long as the current was maintained.51 experimentation by faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends further analysis of this process known as electromagnetic induction enabled him to state the principle now known as faraday's law of induction that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831 in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy.51 faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work electrochemistry the ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses electrochemistry has always been an important part of electricity from the initial invention of the voltaic pile electrochemical cells have evolved into the many different types of batteries electroplating and electrolysis cells aluminium is produced in vast quantities this way and many portable devices are electrically powered using rechargeable cells electric circuits an electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components such that electric charge is made to flow along a closed path a circuit usually to perform some useful task electric power electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit the si unit of power is the watt one joule per second electric power like mechanical power is the rate of doing work measured in watts and represented by the letter p the term wattage is used colloquially to mean electric power in watts. the electric power in watts produced by an electric current i consisting of a charge of q coulombs every t seconds passing through an electric potential voltage difference of v is where electricity generation is often done with electric generators but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour 3.6 mj which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours electric utilities measure power using electricity meters which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer unlike fossil fuels electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.53 electronics electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes transistors diodes optoelectronics sensors and integrated circuits and associated passive interconnection technologies the nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing telecommunications and signal processing the ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible interconnection technologies such as circuit boards electronics packaging technology and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working system today most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control the study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid state physics whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering electromagnetic wave thus the work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into high frequency oscillating currents and via suitably shaped conductors electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances production and uses generation and transmission in the 6th century bc the greek philosopher thales of miletus experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy while this method now known as the triboelectric effect can lift light objects and generate sparks it is extremely inefficient.54 it was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available the voltaic pile and its modern descendant the electrical battery store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy.54 the battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications but its energy storage is finite and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged for large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines electrical power is usually generated by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion or the heat released from nuclear reactions or from other sources such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water the modern steam turbine invented by sir charles parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources such generators bear no resemblance to faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831 but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends.55 the invention in the late nineteenth century of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations where it benefited from economies of scale and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.5657 since electrical energy cannot easily be stored in quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required.56 this requires electricity utilities to make careful predictions of their electrical loads and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations a certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses demand for electricity grows with great rapidity as a nation modernises and its economy develops the united states showed a 12 increase in demand during each year of the first three decades of the twentieth century58 a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of india or china.5960 historically the growth rate for electricity demand has outstripped that for other forms of energy.61:16 environmental concerns with electricity generation have led to an increased focus on generation from renewable sources in particular from wind and hydropower while debate can be expected to continue over the environmental impact of different means of electricity production its final form is relatively clean.61:89 applications electricity is a very convenient way to transfer energy and it has been adapted to a huge and growing number of uses.62 the invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power although electrification brought with it its own dangers replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories.63 public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting in the late 20th century and in modern times the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.64 the resistive joule heating effect employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating while this is versatile and controllable it can be seen as wasteful since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station.65 a number of countries such as denmark have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings.66 electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration67 with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.68 electricity is used within telecommunications and indeed the electrical telegraph demonstrated commercially in 1837 by cooke and wheatstone was one of its earliest applications with the construction of first intercontinental and then transatlantic telegraph systems in the 1860s electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe optical fibre and satellite communication have taken a share of the market for communications systems but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process the effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the electric motor which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power a stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power but a motor that moves with its application such as an electric vehicle is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph electronic devices make use of the transistor perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century69 and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry a modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.70 electricity is also used to fuel public transportation including electric buses and trains 71 electricity and the natural world physiological effects electrical phenomena in nature some organisms such as sharks are able to detect and respond to changes in electric fields an ability known as electroreception77 while others termed electrogenic are able to generate voltages themselves to serve as a predatory or defensive weapon.3 the order gymnotiformes of which the best known example is the electric eel detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes.34 all animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles.78 an electric shock stimulates this system and causes muscles to contract.79 action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.78 cultural perception in 1850 william gladstone asked the scientist michael faraday why electricity was valuable faraday answered one day sir you may tax it.80 in the 19th and early 20th century electricity was not part of the everyday life of many people even in the industrialised western world the popular culture of the time accordingly often depicts it as a mysterious quasi-magical force that can slay the living revive the dead or otherwise bend the laws of nature.81 this attitude began with the 1771 experiments of luigi galvani in which the legs of dead frogs were shown to twitch on application of animal electricity revitalization or resuscitation of apparently dead or drowned persons was reported in the medical literature shortly after galvani's work these results were known to mary shelley when she authored frankenstein 1819 although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster the revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films see also notes references external links  media related to electricity at wikimedia commons navigation menu

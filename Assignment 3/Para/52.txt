winter storm a winter storm is an event in which varieties of precipitation are formed that only occur at low temperatures such as snow or sleet or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are low enough to allow ice to form i.e freezing rain in temperate continental climates these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well very rarely they may form in summer though it would have to be an abnormally cold summer such as the summer of 1816 in the northeast united states of america  contents  snowedit dangers of snowedit accumulating snow can make driving motor vehicles very hazardous accumulation of snow on roadways reduces friction between tires and the pavement which in turn lowers the maneuverability of a vehicle considerably as a result average driving speeds on public roads and highways are reduced by up to 40 while heavy snow is falling.1 visibilities are reduced by falling snow and this is further exacerbated by strong winds which are commonly associated with winter storms producing heavy snowfall in extreme cases this may lead to prolonged whiteout conditions in which visibilities are reduced to only a few feet due to falling or blowing snow these hazards can manifest even after snowfall has ended when strong winds are present as these winds will pick up and transport fallen snow back onto roadways and reduce visibilities in the process this can even result in blizzard conditions if winds are strong enough 2 heavy snowfall can immobilize a vehicle entirely which may be deadly depending on how long it takes rescue crews to arrive the clogging of a vehicle's tailpipe by snow may lead to carbon monoxide buildup inside the cabin.3 depending on the temperature profile in the atmosphere snow can be either wet or dry dry snow being lighter is transported by wind more easily and accumulates more efficiently wet snow is heavier due to the increased water content significant accumulations of heavy wet snow can cause roof damage it also requires considerably more energy to move and this can create health problems while shoveling when combined with the harsh weather conditions numerous deaths as a result of heart attacks can be attributed to snow removal.4 accretion of wet snow to elevated surfaces occurs when snow is sticky enough which can cause extensive tree and power line damage in a manner similar to ice accretion during ice storms power can be lost for days during a major winter storm and this usually means the loss of heating inside buildings other than the obvious risk of hypothermia due to cold exposure another deadly element associated with snowstorms is carbon monoxide poisoning which can happen anytime combustion products from generators or heating appliances are not properly vented finally partially or fully melted snow on roadways can refreeze when temperatures fall creating black ice a sudden rise in air temperature is can result in the rapid melting of snow this can create flooding issues if the snowpack has sufficient water content and this can be significantly exacerbated by heavy rainfall and by ice dams which may have formed on area rivers during prolonged subfreezing temperatures the re-freezing of previously melted snow creates potholes in roadways.5 this process is accelerated when water is melted and re-frozen multiple times fog is also known to occur during rapid melting of snow.6 avalanches and cornices occur when significant amounts of snow falls on mountains freezing rainedit the christmas day ice storm of 2000 caused devastating electrical issues in parts of arkansas oklahoma and texas the city of texarkana arkansas experienced the worst damage at one point losing the ability to use telephones power and running water in some areas in arkansas oklahoma texas and eventually louisiana over an inch of ice accumulated from the freezing rain.89 the ice storm of december 2002 in north carolina resulted in massive power loss throughout much of the state and property damage due to falling trees except in the mountainous western part of the state heavy snow and icy conditions are rare in north carolina the ice storm of december 2005 was another severe winter storm producing extensive ice damage across a large portion of the southern united states on december 14 to 16 it led to power outages and at least 7 deaths graupeledit ice pelletsedit out ahead of the passage of a warm front falling snow may partially melt and refreeze into a frozen rain drop before it reaches the ground these ice pellets are called sleet in most of the us because it is easily seen and does not accumulate ice it is not as dangerous as freezing rain rimeedit see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

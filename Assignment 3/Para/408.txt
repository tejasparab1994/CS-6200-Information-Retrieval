history of atlantic hurricane warnings the national hurricane center became a tropical cyclone warning center in 1956 and assumed many of the functions it has today by 1965 the national hurricane research project begun in the 1950s used aircraft to study tropical cyclones and carry out experiments on mature hurricanes through its stormfury project forecasts within the hurricane advisories were issued one day into the future in 1954 before being extended to two days into the future in 1961 three years into the future in 1964 and 31 years into the future in 2001 from the 1960s through the 1980s work from the various regional hurricane offices was consolidated into the national hurricane center its name was changed to the tropical prediction center in 1995 before reassuming its national hurricane center name in 2010 tropical cyclone forecasting is done nowadays using statistical methods based on tropical cyclone climatology as well as methods of numerical weather prediction where computers use mathematical equations of motion to determine their movement  contents  early yearsedit hurricane season conceptedit national hurricane research projectedit the national hurricane research project nhrp was initiated in 1955 by the united states weather bureau in response to the devastating 1954 hurricane season which significantly impacted the mid-atlantic states and new england robert simpson a weather bureau meteorologist who had participated in air force hurricane reconnaissance flights as an observer was appointed as the first director of nhrp and organized the research operations base at morrison air force base now palm beach international airport in west palm beach florida in 1956 during the first three years of the project scientists used three specially instrumented air force hurricane hunters aircraft with crews on bailment from the 55th weather reconnaissance squadron collecting data which delineated the structure and energy budget of hurricanes for the first time.22 in 1959 the project was moved to miami and collocated with the miami hurricane forecast office the department of commerce leased two dc-6 aircraft and received a b-57 jet from the air force so that nhrp could continue to carry out airborne experiments on hurricanes the combination of research project forecast center and aircraft facility was dubbed the national hurricane center nhc during the 1960s while nhrp continued to carry out research flights the project also began to create computer models of hurricane circulation formulated a statistical track program nhc-64 wrote a manual on hurricane forecasting and evaluated the accuracy of track forecasts.22 starting with hurricane esther 1961 nhrp was heavily involved with project stormfury the u s government's experiment in hurricane modification late in 1964 the project was renamed the national hurricane research laboratory in recognition of it becoming a permanent institution within the weather bureau this presaged the creation of the environmental research laboratories the next year.23 national hurricane centeredit tropical cyclone forecastingedit tropical cyclone forecasting relies on data provided by numerical weather models three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that is not based on the physics of the atmosphere at the time dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.35 advisory watch and warning evolutionedit current operationsedit during the hurricane season the national hurricane center routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season special tropical weather outlooks will be issued.45 while a tropical cyclone is active six hourly advisories will be issued which become more frequent once a tropical cyclone watch or warning are issued tropical cyclone watches and warnings are coordinated within the countries and dependencies involved with the national hurricane center coordinating with national weather service forecast offices concerning storms threatening the united states and its dependencies routine coordination occurs at 1700 utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future.46 referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

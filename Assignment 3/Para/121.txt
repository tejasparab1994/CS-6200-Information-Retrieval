tropical cyclone rainfall climatology a tropical cyclone rainfall climatology is developed to determine rain storm size and degree of vertical wind shear one of the most significant threats from tropical cyclones is heavy rainfall large slow moving and non-sheared tropical cyclones produce the heaviest rains the intensity of a tropical cyclone appears to have little bearing on its potential for rainfall over land but satellite measurements over the last several years show that more intense tropical cyclones produce noticeably more rainfall over water flooding from tropical cyclones remains a significant cause of fatalities particularly in low-lying areas  contents  anticipating a flood eventedit general distribution within a tropical cycloneedit relation to storm sizeedit larger tropical cyclones have larger rain shields which can lead to higher rainfall amounts farther from the cyclone's center.6 this is generally due to the longer time frame rainfall falls at any one spot in a larger system when compared to a smaller system some of the difference seen concerning rainfall between larger and small storms could be the increased sampling of rainfall within a larger tropical cyclone when compared to that of a compact cyclone in other words the difference could be the result of a statistical problem slow/looping motion on rainfall magnitudeedit vertical wind shear impact on rainfall shieldedit vertical wind shear forces the rainfall pattern around a tropical cyclone to become highly asymmetric with most of the precipitation falling to the left and downwind of the shear vector or downshear left in other words southwesterly shear forces the bulk of the rainfall north-northeast of the center.10 if the wind shear is strong enough the bulk of the rainfall will move away from the center leading to what is known as an exposed circulation center when this occurs the potential magnitude of rainfall with the tropical cyclone will be significantly reduced effect of interaction with frontal boundaries/upper level troughsedit as a tropical cyclone interacts with an upper-level trough and the related surface front a distinct northern area of precipitation is seen along the front ahead of the axis of the upper level trough this type of interaction can lead to the appearance of the heaviest rainfall falling along and to the left of the tropical cyclone track with the precipitation streaking hundreds of miles or kilometers downwind from the tropical cyclone.11 the stronger the upper trough picking up the tropical cyclone the more significant the left of track shift in the rainfall distribution tends to be.7 mountainsedit moist air forced up the slopes of coastal hills and mountain chains can lead to much heavier rainfall than in the coastal plain this heavy rainfall can lead to landslides which still cause significant loss of life such as seen during hurricane mitch in central america global distributionedit globally tropical cyclone rainfall is more common across the northern hemisphere than across the southern hemisphere this is mainly due to the normal annual tropical cyclone distribution as between half and two-thirds of all tropical cyclones form north of the equator rainfall is concentrated near the 15th parallel in both hemispheres with a less steep dropoff seen with latitude across the northern hemisphere due to the stronger warm water currents seen in that hemisphere which allow tropical cyclones to remain tropical in nature at higher latitudes than south of the equator in the southern hemisphere rainfall impacts will be most common between january and march while north of the equator tropical cyclone rainfall impacts are more common between june and november.7 japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons.12 united states tropical cyclone rainfall statisticsedit see alsoedit referencesedit printed mediaedit referencesedit related external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

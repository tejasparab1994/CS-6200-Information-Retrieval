precipitation in meteorology precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity.2 the main forms of precipitation include drizzle rain sleet snow graupel and hail precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor so that the water condenses and precipitates thus fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate two processes possibly acting together can lead to air becoming saturated cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud short intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called showers.3 moisture that is lifted or otherwise forced to rise over a layer of sub-freezing air at the surface may be condensed into clouds and rain this process is typically active when freezing rain is occurring a stationary front is often present near the area of freezing rain and serves as the foci for forcing and rising air provided necessary and sufficient atmospheric moisture content the moisture within the rising air will condense into clouds namely stratus and cumulonimbus eventually the cloud droplets will grow large enough to form raindrops and descend toward the earth where they will freeze on contact with exposed objects where relatively warm water bodies are present for example due to water evaporation from lakes lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy thundersnow is possible within a cyclone's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands in mountainous areas heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation on the leeward side of mountains desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating the movement of the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone brings rainy seasons to savannah climes precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies e.g when it gets cold mars has precipitation which most likely takes the form of frost rather than rain or snow.5  contents  typesedit mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective stratiform6 and orographic rainfall.7 convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation8 while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation.9 precipitation can be divided into three categories based on whether it falls as liquid water liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface or ice mixtures of different types of precipitation including types in different categories can fall simultaneously liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle rain or drizzle that freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass is called freezing rain or freezing drizzle frozen forms of precipitation include snow ice needles ice pellets hail and graupel.10 how the air becomes saturatededit cooling air to its dew pointedit the dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated and unless super-saturation occurs condenses to water.11 water vapour normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds an elevated portion of a frontal zone forces broad areas of lift which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass it can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.12 there are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point adiabatic cooling conductive cooling radiational cooling and evaporative cooling adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands.13 the air can rise due to convection large-scale atmospheric motions or a physical barrier such as a mountain orographic lift conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface14 usually by being blown from one surface to another for example from a liquid water surface to colder land radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation either by the air or by the surface underneath.15 evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature or until it reaches saturation.16 adding moisture to the airedit the main ways water vapour is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion8 precipitation or virga falling from above17 daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land18 transpiration from plants19 cool or dry air moving over warmer water20 and lifting air over mountains.21 formationedit raindropsedit coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets or when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal which is known as the bergeron process the fall rate of very small droplets is negligible hence clouds do not fall out of the sky precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops when air turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets as these larger water droplets descend coalescence continues so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.22 ice pelletsedit ice pellets or sleet are a form of precipitation consisting of small translucent balls of ice ice pellets are usually but not always smaller than hailstones.28 they often bounce when they hit the ground and generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain the metar code for ice pellets is pl.27 ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air exists with sub-freezing air both above and below this causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer as they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface they re-freeze into ice pellets however if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze and freezing rain will be the result at the surface a temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season29 but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front hailedit snowflakesedit diamond dustedit causesedit frontal activityedit stratiform or dynamic precipitation occurs as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems on the order of cm/s such as over surface cold fronts and over and ahead of warm fronts similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones.43 a wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front with thunderstorms possible but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.44 precipitation may occur on celestial bodies other than earth when it gets cold mars has precipitation that most likely takes the form of ice needles rather than rain or snow.5 convectionedit convective rain or showery precipitation occurs from convective clouds e.g. cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective however it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.2543 graupel and hail indicate convection.45 in mid-latitudes convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts squall lines and warm fronts.46 orographic effectsedit orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation in mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds for example the trade winds a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side moisture is removed by orographic lift leaving drier air see katabatic wind on the descending and generally warming leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.21 in south america the andes mountain range blocks pacific moisture that arrives in that continent resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western argentina.49 the sierra nevada range creates the same effect in north america forming the great basin and mojave deserts.5051 similarly in asia the himalaya mountains create an obstacle to monsoons which leads to extremely high precipitation on the southern side and lower precipitation levels on the northern side snowedit in mountainous areas heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend the mountains and squeeze out precipitation along their windward slopes which in cold conditions falls in the form of snow because of the ruggedness of terrain forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant challenge.57 within the tropicsedit file:cairns climate.svg|thumb|rainfall distribution by month in cairns showing the extent of the wet season at that location the wet or rainy season is the time of year covering one or more months when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls.58 the term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities.59 areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.60 savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.61 some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season.24 when the wet season occurs during the warm season or summer rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours the wet season is a time when air quality improves62 freshwater quality improves6364 and vegetation grows significantly soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases.24 animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest which occurs late in the wet season.65 tropical cyclones a source of very heavy rainfall consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction southern hemisphere or counterclockwise northern hemisphere.66 although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.67 areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.68 large-scale geographical distributionedit on the large scale the highest precipitation amounts outside topography fall in the tropics closely tied to the intertropical convergence zone itself the ascending branch of the hadley cell mountainous locales near the equator in colombia are amongst the wettest places on earth.69 north and south of this are regions of descending air that form subtropical ridges where precipitation is low;70 the land surface underneath is usually arid which forms most of the earth's deserts.71 an exception to this rule is in hawaii where upslope flow due to the trade winds lead to one of the wettest locations on earth.72 otherwise the flow of the westerlies into the rocky mountains lead to the wettest and at elevation snowiest73 locations within north america in asia during the wet season the flow of moist air into the himalayas leads to some of the greatest rainfall amounts measured on earth in northeast india measurementedit other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile the tipping bucket rain gauge and the weighing rain gauge.77 the wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow attempts to compensate for snow/ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow but again the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins for those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with any of the above rain gauges can be made at home with enough know-how.78 when a precipitation measurement is made various networks exist across the united states and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the internet such as cocorahs or globe.7980 if a network is not available in the area where one lives the nearest local weather office will likely be interested in the measurement.81 hydrometeor definitionedit a concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor bits of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors formations due to condensation such as clouds haze fog and mist are composed of hydrometeors all precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition including virga which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground particles blown from the earth's surface by wind such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray are also hydrometeors.82 satellite estimatesedit although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation there are many areas in which their use is not feasible this includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas in other cases social technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations as a result the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations.83 satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories thermal infrared ir sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops due to the typical structure of the atmosphere cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes further cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds various mathematical schemes or algorithms use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the ir data.84 additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels additional ir channels water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals however most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources 85 satellite data setsedit since the late 1990s several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites sensors seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets the goal is to provide best estimates of precipitation on a uniform time/space grid usually for as much of the globe as possible in some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized which is the climate data record standard in other cases the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate which is the high resolution precipitation product approach in either case of course the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable one key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates the difficulties in using gauge data are that 1 their availability is limited as noted above and 2 the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission assembly processing and quality control thus precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates as a result while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the true precipitation they are generally not suited for real or near-real-time applications the work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats time/space grids periods of record and regions of coverage input datasets and analysis procedures as well as many different forms of dataset version designators.86 in many cases one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use return periodedit an oceanic or maritime climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents bordering cool oceans as well as southeastern australia and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.95 the mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the mediterranean basin parts of western north america parts of western and south australia in southwestern south africa and in parts of central chile the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool wet winters.96 a steppe is a dry grassland.97 subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.98 effect on agricultureedit precipitation especially rain has a dramatic effect on agriculture all plants need at least some water to survive therefore rain being the most effective means of watering is important to agriculture while a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants too much or too little rainfall can be harmful even devastating to crops drought can kill crops and increase erosion99 while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth.100 plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive for example certain cacti require small amounts of water101 while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive in areas with wet and dry seasons soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.24 animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature.102 developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest which occurs late in the wet season.65 changes due to global warmingedit changes due to urban heat islandedit forecastingedit the quantitative precipitation forecast abbreviated qpf is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.106 a qpf will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a qpf valid period precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000 0600 1200 and 1800 gmt terrain is considered in qpfs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail.107 starting in the mid to late 1990s qpfs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the united states.108 forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere which decreases with height.109 qpf can be generated on a quantitative forecasting amounts or a qualitative forecasting the probability of a specific amount basis.110 radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within six to seven hours of the time of the radar image the forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements weather radar estimates or a combination of both various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.111 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools

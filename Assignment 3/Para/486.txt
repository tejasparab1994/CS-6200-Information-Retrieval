siberian high  contents  overviewedit the siberian high affects the weather patterns in most parts of the northern hemisphere its influence extends as far west as italy3 and as far southeast as malaysia4 where it is a critical component of the northeast monsoon occasionally a strong siberian high can bring unusually cold weather into the tropics as far southeast as the philippines.5 it may block or reduce the size of low-pressure cells and generate dry weather across much of the asian landscape with the exception of regions such as hokuriku and the caspian sea coast of iran that receive orographic rainfall from the winds it generates as a result of the siberian high coastal winters in the main city of pacific russia vladivostok are very cold in relation to its latitude and proximity to the ocean siberian air is generally colder than arctic air because unlike arctic air which forms over the sea ice around the north pole siberian air forms over the cold tundra of siberia which does not radiate heat the same way the ice of the arctic does.6 genesis and variabilityedit in general the siberian high-pressure system begins to build up at the end of august reaches its peak in the winter and remains strong until the end of april its genesis at the end of the arctic summer is caused by the convergence of summer air flows being cooled over interior northeast asia as days shorten in the process of the siberian high's formation the upper-level jet is transferred across northern eurasia by adiabatic cooling and descending advection which in extreme cases creates cold domes that outbreak over warmer parts of east asia see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

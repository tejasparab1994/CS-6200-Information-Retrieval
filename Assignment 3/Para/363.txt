accumulated cyclone energy accumulated cyclone energy ace is a measure used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones and entire tropical cyclone seasons particularly the north atlantic hurricane season it uses an approximation of the wind energy used by a tropical system over its lifetime and is calculated every six hours the ace of a season is the sum of the aces for each storm and takes into account the number strength and duration of all the tropical storms in the season the highest ace calculated for a single storm is 82 for hurricane/typhoon ioke in 2006.1  contents  calculationedit where vmax is estimated sustained wind speed in knots kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity and by adding together the energy per some interval of time the accumulated energy is found as the duration of a storm increases more values are summed and the ace also increases such that longer-duration storms may accumulate a larger ace than more-powerful storms of lesser duration although ace is a value proportional to the energy of the system it is not a direct calculation of energy the mass of the moved air and therefore the size of the storm would show up in a real energy calculation a related quantity is hurricane destruction potential hdp which is ace but only calculated for the time where the system is a hurricane.3 competing measurement metricsedit ace focuses upon the most intense winds concentrated in a storm's center whereas the actual destructive power of a storm depends upon the total area impacted with damaging winds waves and storm surge the metric integrated kinetic energy ike developed in 2007 more accurately reflects the destructive potential it examines the kinetic energy that forces a storm surge and creates high waves as well as the horizontal wind loads over the full storm this metric yields a time specific value for a storm and doesn't account for the destruction caused by a storm over its entire life therefore in 2013 the researchers at the university of florida created a metric called track integrated kinetic energy tike tike expands the concept by accumulating ike over the lifespan of an individual tropical cyclone and a total value for all named tropical cyclones in the season 4 atlantic basin aceedit categoriesedit according to the noaa categorization system for the atlantic the most recent above-normal season is the 2017 season the most recent near-normal season is the 2014 season and the most recent below normal season is the 2015 season hyperactivityedit individual stormsedit the highest ever ace estimated for a single storm in the atlantic is 73.6 for the san ciriaco hurricane in 1899 this single storm had an ace higher than many whole atlantic storm seasons other atlantic storms with high aces include hurricane ivan in 2004 with an ace of 70.4 hurricane irma in 2017 with an ace of 66.6 the great charleston hurricane of 1893 with an ace of 63.5 hurricane isabel in 2003 with an ace of 63.3 and the 1932 cuba hurricane with an ace of 59.8.8 ace data for the atlantic hurricane season is less reliable prior to the modern satellite era but noaa has analyzed the best available information dating back to 1851 the 1933 atlantic hurricane season is considered the highest ace on record with a total of 25910 for the current season or the season that just ended the ace is preliminary based on national hurricane center bulletins which may later be revised east pacific aceedit the unofficial categorization of seasons for this table is based mutatis mutandis on that used in the atlantic basin see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

radius of maximum wind the radius of maximum wind rmw is the distance between the center of a cyclone and its band of strongest winds it is a parameter in atmospheric dynamics and tropical cyclone forecasting.1 the highest rainfall rates occur near the rmw of tropical cyclones the extent of a cyclone's storm surge and its maximum potential intensity can be determined using the rmw as maximum sustained winds increase the rmw decreases recently rmw has been used in descriptions of tornadoes when designing buildings to prevent against failure from atmospheric pressure change rmw can be used in the calculations.2  contents  determinationedit the rmw is traditionally measured by reconnaissance aircraft in the atlantic basin.1 it can also be determined on weather maps as the distance between the cyclone center and the system's greatest pressure gradient.3 using weather satellite data the distance between the coldest cloud top temperature and the warmest temperatature within the eye in infrared satellite imagery is one method of determining rmw the reason why this method has merit is that the strongest winds within tropical cyclones tend to be located under the deepest convection which is seen on satellite imagery as the coldest cloud tops.1 use of velocity data from doppler weather radar can also be used to determine this quantity both for tornadoes and tropical cyclones near the coast tornadoesedit tropical cyclonesedit the radius of maximum wind helps determine the direct strikes of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones are considered to have made a direct strike to a landmass when a tropical cyclone passes close enough to a landmass that areas inside the radius of maximum wind are experienced on land.10 the radius of maximum wind is used within the maximum potential intensity equation the emanuel equation for maximum intensity potential relies upon the winds near the rmw of a tropical cyclone to determine its ultimate potential.11 the highest storm surge is normally coincident with the radius of maximum wind because the strongest winds within a tropical cyclone lie at the rmw this is the region of a tropical cyclone which generates the dominant waves near the storm and ultimately ocean swell away from the cyclone.12 tropical cyclones mix the ocean water within a radius three times that of the rmw which lowers sea surface temperatures due to upwelling.7 much is still unknown about the radius of maximum wind in tropical cyclones including whether or not it can be predictable.13 see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

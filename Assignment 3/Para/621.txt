carolina hurricanes  contents  franchise historyedit as one of the most stable wha teams the whalers along with the edmonton oilers quebec nordiques and winnipeg jets were admitted to the nhl when the rival leagues merged in 1979 however under pressure from the extant nhl team in the new england area the boston bruins the whalers were compelled to rename the team the hartford whalers the whalers were never as successful in the nhl as they had been in the wha recording only three winning seasons they peaked in the mid-to-late 1980s winning their only playoff series in 1986 over the nordiques before bowing out in the second round to the montreal canadiens taking the habs to overtime of game 7 in the process the next year the club secured the regular-season adams division title only to fall to the nordiques in six games in the first round of the playoffs in 1992 the whalers made the playoffs for the final time but were bounced in the first round in seven games by the canadiens the organization retains many whaler connections among its off-ice personnel in addition to many members of executive management and the coaching staff broadcasters chuck kaiton john forslund and tripp tracy at the time a minor-league player and equipment managers wally tatomir skip cunningham and bob gorman all made the move to north carolina with the team finally the old goal horn from the hartford civic center remains in use at pnc arena the whalers were plagued for most of their existence by limited marketability hartford was the smallest american market in the league and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for new york city and boston teams it did not help matters that the hartford civic center was one of the smallest arenas in the league seating just over 15000 people for hockey the whalers off-ice problems were magnified when the start of the 1990s triggered a spike in player salaries in the eastern conference finals carolina met the heavily-favored toronto maple leafs in game 6 in toronto the leafs mats sundin tied the game with 22 seconds remaining to send it to overtime where carolina's martin gelinas would score to send the franchise to their first stanley cup finals appearance during this series several hurricanes fan traditions drew hockey-wide media attention for the first time fans met the team at the airport on the return from every road trip and echoed football-season habits honed for games across the parking lot by hosting massive tailgate parties before each home game a relative novelty in the cold-weather-centric nhl inside the building the cbc's don cherry lauded the rbc center as the loudest building in the nhl praise that would be echoed in 2006.8 in the stanley cup finals carolina would face the detroit red wings thought to be the prohibitive favorite all year though the 'canes stunned the wings in game 1 when ron francis scored in the first minute of overtime detroit stormed back to win the next four games game 3 in raleigh featured a triple-overtime thriller eventually won by detroit's igor larionov the oldest player to score a last-round goal stanley cup championsedit in the playoffs after losing the first two games of the conference quarterfinal series against the montreal canadiens laviolette lifted goalkeeper martin gerber  who had been struggling to regain his

winning the series on a game 6 overtime goal by cory stillman carolina then faced the new jersey devils in the conference semi-finals which proved surprisingly one-sided as the hurricanes beat the devils in five games stillman struck again once again scoring the series-winning goal the hurricanes stanley cup championship marked the first professional major league sports title for a team from north carolina as well they were the first nhl team to win the stanley cup despite losing at least nine playoff games in that year the 2011 boston bruins the 2014 los angeles kings and the 2017 pittsburgh penguins are the only other teams to have accomplished the feat as a result of their surprise run very few changes were made in the off-season veterans such as aaron ward andrew alberts and stephane yelle were brought in to help drive the team further but things did not go according to plan the hurricanes experienced a 14-game losing streak spanning october and november and midway through the year the 'canes replaced their only post-lockout captain rod brind'amour with eric staal despite improved play during the second half of the season they could not overcome the deficit from early on in the season the hurricanes would end up with the seventh overall pick in the 2010 nhl entry draft eventually selecting jeff skinner from the kitchener rangers of the ontario hockey league

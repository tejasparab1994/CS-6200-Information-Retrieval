space shuttle the space shuttle was a partially reusable low earth orbital spacecraft system operated by the u.s national aeronautics and space administration nasa as part of the space shuttle program its official program name was space transportation system sts taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development.10 the first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 five complete shuttle systems were built and used on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011 launched from the kennedy space center ksc in florida operational missions launched numerous satellites interplanetary probes and the hubble space telescope hst conducted science experiments in orbit and participated in construction and servicing of the international space station the shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days 19 hours 21 minutes and 23 seconds.11 shuttle components included the orbiter vehicle ov a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters srbs and the expendable external tank et containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen the shuttle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket with the two srbs operating in parallel with the ov's three main engines which were fueled from the et the srbs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit and the et was jettisoned just before orbit insertion which used the orbiter's two orbital maneuvering system oms engines at the conclusion of the mission the orbiter fired its oms to de-orbit and re-enter the atmosphere the orbiter then glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing usually to the shuttle landing facility at kennedy space center florida or rogers dry lake in edwards air force base california after landing at edwards the orbiter was flown back to the ksc on the shuttle carrier aircraft a specially modified version of the boeing 747 the first orbiter enterprise was built in 1976 used in approach and landing tests and had no orbital capability four fully operational orbiters were initially built columbia challenger discovery and atlantis of these two were lost in mission accidents challenger in 1986 and columbia in 2003 with a total of fourteen astronauts killed a fifth operational and sixth in total orbiter endeavour was built in 1991 to replace challenger the space shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of atlantis's final flight on july 21 2011  contents  overviewedit the space shuttle was a partially reusable12 human spaceflight vehicle capable of reaching low earth orbit commissioned and operated by the us national aeronautics and space administration nasa from 1981 to 2011 it resulted from shuttle design studies conducted by nasa and the us air force in the 1960s and was first proposed for development as part of an ambitious second-generation space transportation system sts of space vehicles to follow the apollo program in a september 1969 report of a space task group headed by vice president spiro agnew to president richard nixon nixon's post-apollo nasa budgeting withdrew support of all system components except the shuttle to which nasa applied the sts name.10 the vehicle consisted of a spaceplane for orbit and re-entry fueled by expendable liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks with reusable strap-on solid booster rockets the first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981 leading to operational flights beginning in 1982 all launched from the kennedy space center florida the system was retired from service in 2011 after 135 missions13 with atlantis making the final launch of the three-decade shuttle program on july 8 2011.14 the program ended after atlantis landed at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 major missions included launching numerous satellites and interplanetary probes15 conducting space science experiments and servicing and construction of space stations the first orbiter vehicle named enterprise was built for the initial approach and landing tests phase and lacked engines heat shielding and other equipment necessary for orbital flight.16 a total of five operational orbiters were built and of these two were destroyed in accidents at launch it consisted of the stack including the dark orange external tank et for the first two launches the tank was painted white;2324 two white slender solid rocket boosters srbs and the orbiter vehicle which contained the crew and payload some payloads were launched into higher orbits with either of two different upper stages developed for the sts single-stage payload assist module or two-stage inertial upper stage the space shuttle was stacked in the vehicle assembly building and the stack mounted on a mobile launch platform held down by four frangible nuts25 on each srb which were detonated at launch.26 when the orbiter's space mission was complete it fired its oms thrusters to drop out of orbit and re-enter the lower atmosphere.29 during descent the orbiter passed through different layers of the atmosphere and decelerated from hypersonic speed primarily by aerobraking in the lower atmosphere and landing phase it was more like a glider but with reaction control system rcs thrusters and fly-by-wire-controlled hydraulically actuated flight surfaces controlling its descent it landed on a long runway as a conventional aircraft the aerodynamic shape was a compromise between the demands of radically different speeds and air pressures during re-entry hypersonic flight and subsonic atmospheric flight as a result the orbiter had a relatively high sink rate at low altitudes and it transitioned during re-entry from using rcs thrusters at very high altitudes to flight surfaces in the lower atmosphere early historyedit the formal design of what became the space shuttle began with the phase a contract design studies issued in the late 1960s conceptualization had begun two decades earlier before the apollo program of the 1960s one of the places the concept of a spacecraft returning from space to a horizontal landing originated was within naca in 1954 in the form of an aeronautics research experiment later named the x-15 the naca proposal was submitted by walter dornberger in 1958 the x-15 concept further developed into proposal to launch an x-15 into space and another x-series spaceplane proposal named x-20 dyna-soar as well as variety of aerospace plane concepts and studies neil armstrong was selected to pilot both the x-15 and the x-20 though the x-20 was not built another spaceplane similar to the x-20 was built several years later and delivered to nasa in january 1966 called the hl-10 hl indicated horizontal landing in 1968 nasa officially began work on what was then known as the integrated launch and re-entry vehicle ilrv at the same time nasa held a separate space shuttle main engine ssme competition nasa offices in houston and huntsville jointly issued a request for proposal rfp for ilrv studies to design a spacecraft that could deliver a payload to orbit but also re-enter the atmosphere and fly back to earth for example one of the responses was for a two-stage design featuring a large booster and a small orbiter called the dc-3 one of several phase a shuttle designs after the aforementioned phase a studies b c and d phases progressively evaluated in-depth designs up to 1972 in the final design the bottom stage consisted of recoverable solid rocket boosters and the top stage used an expendable external tank.30 in 1969 president richard nixon decided to support proceeding with space shuttle development a series of development programs and analysis refined the basic design prior to full development and testing in august 1973 the x-24b proved that an unpowered spaceplane could re-enter earth's atmosphere for a horizontal landing descriptionedit each space shuttle was a reusable launch system composed of three main assemblies the reusable ov the expendable et and the two reusable srbs.32 only the ov entered orbit shortly after the tank and boosters are jettisoned the vehicle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket and the orbiter glided to a horizontal landing like an airplane after which it was refurbished for reuse the srbs parachuted to splashdown in the ocean where they were towed back to shore and refurbished for later shuttle missions at times the orbiter itself was referred to as the space shuttle this was not technically correct as the space shuttle was the combination of the orbiter the external tank and the two solid rocket boosters these components once assembled in the vehicle assembly building originally built to assemble the apollo saturn v rocket were commonly referred to as the stack.37 responsibility for the shuttle components was spread among multiple nasa field centers the kennedy space center was responsible for launch landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits the only orbit profile actually used in the program the us air force at the vandenberg air force base was responsible for launch landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits though this was never used the johnson space center served as the central point for all shuttle operations the marshall space flight center was responsible for the main engines external tank and solid rocket boosters the john c stennis space center handled main engine testing and the goddard space flight center managed the global tracking network.38 orbiter vehicleedit the orbiter resembled a conventional aircraft with double-delta wings swept 81 at the inner leading edge and 45 at the outer leading edge its vertical stabilizer's leading edge was swept back at a 50 angle the four elevons mounted at the trailing edge of the wings and the rudder/speed brake attached at the trailing edge of the stabilizer with the body flap controlled the orbiter during descent and landing three space shuttle main engines ssmes were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern the engine nozzles could gimbal 10.5 degrees up and down and 8.5 degrees from side to side during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the shuttle the orbiter structure was made primarily from aluminum alloy although the engine structure was made primarily from titanium alloy the operational orbiters built were ov-102 columbia ov-099 challenger ov-103 discovery ov-104 atlantis and ov-105 endeavour.40 space shuttle atlantis transported by a boeing 747 shuttle carrier aircraft sca 1998 nasa space shuttle endeavour being transported by a shuttle carrier aircraft an overhead view of atlantis as it sits atop the mobile launcher platform mlp before sts-79 two tail service masts tsms to either side of the orbiter's tail provide umbilical connections for propellant loading and electrical power external tankedit the main function of the space shuttle external tank was to supply the liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel to the main engines it was also the backbone of the launch vehicle providing attachment points for the two solid rocket boosters and the orbiter the external tank was the only part of the shuttle system that was not reused although the external tanks were always discarded it would have been possible to take them into orbit and re-use them such as a wet workshop for incorporation into a space station.2842 solid rocket boostersedit astronauts who have flown on multiple spacecraft report that shuttle delivers a rougher ride than apollo or soyuz.4748 the additional vibration is caused by the solid rocket boosters as solid fuel does not burn as evenly as liquid fuel the vibration dampens down after the solid rocket boosters have been jettisoned.4950 two srb on the crawler prior to mating with the shuttle srb sections filled with solid propellant being assembled orbiter and the external tank flanked by the two solid rocket boosters orbiter add-onsedit mplm leonardo ius deploying with galileo pam-d with satellite edo being installed spacelab in orbit rms canadarm spacehab spacelabedit a major component of the space shuttle program was spacelab primarily contributed by a consortium of european countries and operated in conjunction with the united states and international partners.52 supported by a modular system of pressurized modules pallets and systems spacelab missions executed on multidisciplinary science orbital logistics and international cooperation.52 over 29 missions flew on subjects ranging from astronomy microgravity radar and life sciences to name a few.52 spacelab hardware also supported missions such as hubble hst servicing and space station resupply.52 sts-2 and sts-3 provided testing and the first full mission was spacelab-1 sts-9 launched on november 28 1983.52 spacelab formally began in 1973 after a meeting in brussels belgium by european heads of state.31 within the decade spacelab went into orbit and provided europe and the united states with an orbital workshop and hardware system.31 international cooperation science and exploration were realized on spacelab.52 flight systemsedit the shuttle was one of the earliest craft to use a computerized fly-by-wire digital flight control system this means no mechanical or hydraulic linkages connected the pilot's control stick to the control surfaces or reaction control system thrusters the control algorithm which used a classical proportional integral derivative pid approach was developed and maintained by honeywell.citation needed the shuttle's fly-by-wire digital flight control system was composed of 4 control systems each addressing a different mission phase ascent descent on-orbit and aborts.citation needed honeywell is also credited with the design and implementation of the shuttle's nose wheel steering control algorithm that allowed the orbiter to safely land at kennedy space center's shuttle runway.citation needed a concern with using digital fly-by-wire systems on the shuttle was reliability considerable research went into the shuttle computer system the shuttle used five identical redundant ibm 32-bit general purpose computers gpcs model ap-101 constituting a type of embedded system four computers ran specialized software called the primary avionics software system pass a fifth backup computer ran separate software called the backup flight system bfs collectively they were called the data processing system dps.5354 the design goal of the shuttle's dps was fail-operational/fail-safe reliability after a single failure the shuttle could still continue the mission after two failures it could still land safely the four general-purpose computers operated essentially in lockstep checking each other if one computer provided a different result than the other three i.e the one computer failed the three functioning computers voted it out of the system this isolated it from vehicle control if a second computer of the three remaining failed the two functioning computers voted it out a very unlikely failure mode would have been where two of the computers produced result a and two produced result b a two-two split in this unlikely case one group of two was to be picked at random the backup flight system bfs was separately developed software running on the fifth computer used only if the entire four-computer primary system failed the bfs was created because although the four primary computers were hardware redundant they all ran the same software so a generic software problem could crash all of them embedded system avionic software was developed under totally different conditions from public commercial software the number of code lines was tiny compared to a public commercial software product changes were only made infrequently and with extensive testing and many programming and test personnel worked on the small amount of computer code however in theory it could have still failed and the bfs existed for that contingency while the bfs could run in parallel with pass the bfs never engaged to take over control from pass during any shuttle mission the software for the shuttle computers was written in a high-level language called hal/s somewhat similar to pl/i it is specifically designed for a real time embedded system environment the ibm ap-101 computers originally had about 424 kilobytes of magnetic core memory each the cpu could process about 400000 instructions per second they had no hard disk drive and loaded software from magnetic tape cartridges early shuttle missions starting in november 1983 took along the grid compass arguably one of the first laptop computers the grid was given the name spoc for shuttle portable onboard computer use on the shuttle required both hardware and software modifications which were incorporated into later versions of the commercial product it was used to monitor and display the shuttle's ground position path of the next two orbits show where the shuttle had line of sight communications with ground stations and determine points for location-specific observations of the earth the compass sold poorly as it cost at least us$8000 but it offered unmatched performance for its weight and size.55 nasa was one of its main customers.56 during its service life the shuttle's control system never experienced a failure many of the lessons learned have been used to design today's high speed control algorithms.57 orbiter markings and insigniaedit the prototype orbiter enterprise originally had a flag of the united states on the upper surface of the left wing and the letters usa in black on the right wing the name enterprise was painted in black on the payload bay doors just above the hinge and behind the crew module on the aft end of the payload bay doors was the nasa worm logotype in gray underneath the rear of the payload bay doors on the side of the fuselage just above the wing is the text united states in black with a flag of the united states ahead of it the first operational orbiter columbia originally had the same markings as enterprise although the letters usa on the right wing were slightly larger and spaced farther apart columbia also had black markings which enterprise lacked on its forward rcs module around the cockpit windows and on its vertical stabilizer and had distinctive black chines on the forward part of its upper wing surfaces which none of the other orbiters had challenger established a modified marking scheme for the shuttle fleet that was matched by discovery atlantis and endeavour the letters usa in black above an american flag were displayed on the left wing with the nasa worm logotype in gray centered above the name of the orbiter in black on the right wing the name of the orbiter was inscribed not on the payload bay doors but on the forward fuselage just below and behind the cockpit windows this would make the name visible when the shuttle was photographed in orbit with the doors open beginning in 1998 the flight vehicles markings were modified to incorporate the nasa meatball insignia the worm logotype which the agency had phased out was removed from the payload bay doors and the meatball insignia was added aft of the united states text on the lower aft fuselage the meatball insignia was also displayed on the left wing with the american flag above the orbiter's name left-justified rather than centered on the right wing the three surviving flight vehicles discovery atlantis and endeavour still bear these markings as museum displays enterprise became the property of the smithsonian institution in 1985 and was no longer under nasa's control when these changes were made hence the prototype orbiter still has its 1983 markings and still has its name on the payload bay doors upgradesedit the space shuttle was initially developed in the 1970s58 but received many upgrades and modifications afterward to improve performance reliability and safety internally the shuttle remained largely similar to the original design with the exception of the improved avionics computers in addition to the computer upgrades the original analog primary flight instruments were replaced with modern full-color flat-panel display screens called a glass cockpit which is similar to those of contemporary airliners to facilitate construction of iss the internal airlocks of each orbiter except columbia59 were replaced with external docking systems to allow for a greater amount of cargo to be stored on the shuttle's mid-deck during station resupply missions the space shuttle main engines ssmes had several improvements to enhance reliability and power this explains phrases such as main engines throttling up to 104 percent. this did not mean the engines were being run over a safe limit the 100 percent figure was the original specified power level during the lengthy development program rocketdyne determined the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104 percent of the originally specified thrust nasa could have rescaled the output number saying in essence 104 percent is now 100 percent to clarify this would have required revising much previous documentation and software so the 104 percent number was retained ssme upgrades were denoted as block numbers such as block i block ii and block iia the upgrades improved engine reliability maintainability and performance the 109 thrust level was finally reached in flight hardware with the block ii engines in 2001 the normal maximum throttle was 104 percent with 106 percent or 109 percent used for mission aborts the solid rocket boosters underwent improvements as well design engineers added a third o-ring seal to the joints between the segments after the 1986 space shuttle challenger disaster sts-70 was delayed in 1995 when woodpeckers bored holes in the foam insulation of discovery's external tank since then nasa has installed commercial plastic owl decoys and inflatable owl balloons which had to be removed prior to launch.63 the delicate nature of the foam insulation had been the cause of damage to the thermal protection system the tile heat shield and heat wrap of the orbiter nasa remained confident that this damage while it was the primary cause of the space shuttle columbia disaster on february 1 2003 would not jeopardize the completion of the international space station iss in the projected time allotted on the first four shuttle missions astronauts wore modified us air force high-altitude full-pressure suits which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent from the fifth flight sts-5 until the loss of challenger one-piece light blue nomex flight suits and partial-pressure helmets were worn a less-bulky partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet was reinstated when shuttle flights resumed in 1988 the launch-entry suit ended its service life in late 1995 and was replaced by the full-pressure advanced crew escape suit aces which resembled the gemini space suit in design but retained the orange color of the launch-entry suit to extend the duration that orbiters could stay docked at the iss the station-to-shuttle power transfer system sspts was installed the sspts allowed these orbiters to use power provided by the iss to preserve their consumables the sspts was first used successfully on sts-118 specificationsedit  orbiter65 for endeavour ov-105 external tank for slwt solid rocket boosters system stack mission profileedit launch preparationedit all space shuttle missions were launched from kennedy space center ksc the weather criteria used for launch included but were not limited to precipitation temperatures cloud cover lightning forecast wind and humidity.70 the shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck by lightning aircraft are often struck by lightning with no adverse effects because the electricity of the strike is dissipated through its conductive structure and the aircraft is not electrically grounded like most jet airliners the shuttle was mainly constructed of conductive aluminum which would normally shield and protect the internal systems however upon liftoff the shuttle sent out a long exhaust plume as it ascended and this plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground the nasa anvil rule for a shuttle launch stated that an anvil cloud could not appear within a distance of 10 nautical miles.71 the shuttle launch weather officer monitored conditions until the final decision to scrub a launch was announced in addition the weather conditions had to be acceptable at one of the transatlantic abort landing sites one of several space shuttle abort modes to launch as well as the solid rocket booster recovery area.7072 while the shuttle might have safely endured a lightning strike a similar strike caused problems on apollo 12 so for safety nasa chose not to launch the shuttle if lightning was possible npr8715.5 historically the shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from december to january a year-end rollover or yero its flight software designed in the 1970s was not designed for this and would require the orbiter's computers be reset through a change of year which could cause a glitch while in orbit in 2007 nasa engineers devised a solution so shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary.73 launchedit after the final hold in the countdown at t-minus 9 minutes the shuttle went through its final preparations for launch and the countdown was automatically controlled by the ground launch sequencer gls software at the launch control center which stopped the count if it sensed a critical problem with any of the shuttle's onboard systems the gls handed off the count to the shuttle's on-board computers at t minus 31 seconds in a process called auto sequence start at t-minus 10 seconds hydrogen igniters were activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase the main engine turbopumps also began charging the combustion chambers with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time the computers reciprocated this action by allowing the redundant computer systems to begin the firing phase at this point the shuttle and external tank were on a slightly suborbital trajectory coasting up towards apogee once at apogee about half an hour after meco the shuttle's orbital maneuvering system oms engines were fired to raise its perigee and achieve orbit while the external tank fell back into the atmosphere and burned up over the indian ocean or the pacific ocean depending on launch profile.65 the sealing action of the tank plumbing and lack of pressure relief systems on the external tank helped it break up in the lower atmosphere after the foam burned away during re-entry the heat caused a pressure buildup in the remaining liquid oxygen and hydrogen until the tank exploded this ensured that any pieces that fell back to earth were small in orbitedit re-entry and landingedit almost the entire space shuttle re-entry procedure except for lowering the landing gear and deploying the air data probes was normally performed under computer control however the re-entry could be flown entirely manually if an emergency arose the approach and landing phase could be controlled by the autopilot but was usually hand flown a space shuttle model undergoes a wind tunnel test in 1975 this test is simulating the ionized gasses that surround a shuttle as it reenters the atmosphere a computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the space shuttle during re-entry the orbiter's maximum glide ratio/lift-to-drag ratio varies considerably with speed ranging from 1:1 at hypersonic speeds 2:1 at supersonic speeds and reaching 4.5:1 at subsonic speeds during approach and landing.83 discovery touches down for the final time at the end of sts-133 endeavour brake chute deploys after touching down  media related to landings of space shuttles at wikimedia commons post-landing processingedit landing sitesedit nasa preferred space shuttle landings to be at kennedy space center.85 if weather conditions made landing there unfavorable the shuttle could delay its landing until conditions are favorable touch down at edwards air force base california or use one of the multiple alternate landing sites around the world a landing at any site other than kennedy space center meant that after touchdown the shuttle must be mated to the shuttle carrier aircraft and returned to cape canaveral space shuttle columbia sts-3 once landed at the white sands space harbor new mexico this was viewed as a last resort as nasa scientists believed that the sand could potentially damage the shuttle's exterior there were many alternative landing sites that were never used.8687 risk contributorsedit an example of technical risk analysis for a sts mission is spra iteration 3.1 top risk contributors for sts-133:8889 an internal nasa risk assessment study conducted by the shuttle program safety and mission assurance office at johnson space center released in late 2010 or early 2011 concluded that the agency had seriously underestimated the level of risk involved in operating the shuttle the report assessed that there was a 1 in 9 chance of a catastrophic disaster during the first nine flights of the shuttle but that safety improvements had later improved the risk ratio to 1 in 90.90 fleet historyedit space shuttle major eventsedit below is a list of major events in the space shuttle orbiter fleet sources nasa launch manifest94 nasa space shuttle archive95 shuttle disastersedit on february 1 2003 columbia disintegrated during re-entry killing its crew of seven because of damage to the carbon-carbon leading edge of the wing caused during launch ground control engineers had made three separate requests for high-resolution images taken by the department of defense that would have provided an understanding of the extent of the damage while nasa's chief thermal protection system tps engineer requested that astronauts on board columbia be allowed to leave the vehicle to inspect the damage nasa managers intervened to stop the department of defense's assistance and refused the request for the spacewalk98 and thus the feasibility of scenarios for astronaut repair or rescue by atlantis were not considered by nasa management at the time.99 retirementedit nasa retired the space shuttle in 2011 after 30 years of service the shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a space truck which would among other things be used to build a united states space station in low earth orbit in the early 1990s when the us space station evolved into the international space station project which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed the retirement of the space shuttle was delayed several times until 2011 serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned discovery was the first of nasa's three remaining operational space shuttles to be retired.100 distribution of orbiters and other hardwareedit nasa announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the space shuttle program each museum or institution is responsible for covering the us$28.8 million cost of preparing and transporting each vehicle for display twenty museums from across the country submitted proposals for receiving one of the retired orbiters.104 nasa also made space shuttle thermal protection system tiles available to schools and universities for less than us$25 each.105 about 7000 tiles were available on a first-come first-served basis limited to one per institution.105 orbiters on displayedit on april 12 2011 nasa announced selection of locations for the remaining shuttle orbiters:106107 in august 2011 the nasa office of inspector general oig published a review of nasa's selection of display locations for the space shuttle orbiters the review had four main findings:108 the nasa oig had three recommendations saying nasa should:108 in september 2011 the ceo and two board members of seattle's museum of flight met with nasa administrator charles bolden pointing out significant errors in deciding where to put its four retiring space shuttles the errors alleged include inaccurate information on museum of flight's attendance and international visitor statistics as well as the readiness of the intrepid sea-air-space museum's exhibit site.109 orbiter replicas on displayedit hardware on displayedit flight and mid-deck training hardware will be taken from the johnson space center and will go to the national air and space museum and the national museum of the u.s air force the full fuselage mockup which includes the payload bay and aft section but no wings is to go to the museum of flight in seattle mission simulation and training facility's fixed simulator will go to the adler planetarium in chicago and the motion simulator will go to the texas a&m aerospace engineering department in college station texas other simulators used in shuttle astronaut training will go to the wings of dreams aviation museum in starke florida and the virginia air and space center in hampton virginia.104 space shuttle successors and legacyedit until another us manned spacecraft is ready crews will travel to and from the international space station iss exclusively aboard the russian soyuz spacecraft the commercial orbital transportation services program began in 2006 with the purpose of creating commercially operated unmanned cargo vehicles to service the iss.116 the commercial crew development ccdev program was started in 2010 to create commercially operated manned spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the iss to stay docked for 180 days and then return them back to earth.117 these spacecraft were to become operational in the 2010s.118 in popular cultureedit space shuttles have been features of fiction and nonfiction from children's movies to documentaries early examples include the 1979 james bond film moonraker the 1982 activision videogame space shuttle a journey into space 1982 and g harry stine's 1981 novel shuttle down in the 1986 film spacecamp atlantis accidentally launches into space with a group of u.s space camp

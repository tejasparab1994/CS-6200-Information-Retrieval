snowsquall a snowsquall or snow squall is a sudden moderately heavy snow fall with blowing snow and strong gusty surface winds.1 it is often referred to as a whiteout and is similar to a blizzard but is localized in time or in location and snow accumulations may or may not be significant  contents  typesedit there are two primary types of snowsqualls lake effect and frontal lake-effect snowedit when arctic air moves over large expanses of warmer open waters in winter convective clouds develop which cause heavy snow showers due to the large amount of moisture available this occurs southwest of extratropical cyclones with the curved cyclonic wind flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm great lakes which then leads to narrow lake-effect snow bands that can produce significant localized snowfall.2 whiteout conditions will affect narrow corridors from shores to inland areas aligned along the prevailing wind direction.34 this will be enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by higher elevations the name originates from the great lakes area of north america however any body of water can produce them regions in lee of oceans such as the canadian maritimes could experience such snowsqualls frontal snowsqualledit a frontal snowsquall is an intense frontal convective line similar to a rainband when temperature is near freezing at the surface the strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow.3 this type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front in situations where there are other contributing factors such as dynamic lifting from a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage in situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles 40 kilometers with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart dangersedit both types of snowsqualls are very dangerous for motorists and airplanes or generally any traveler unfortunate enough to get stuck in one the change in conditions is very sudden and slippery conditions and abrupt loss of visibility due to whiteouts often cause multiple-vehicle collisions in the case of lake effect snow heavy amounts of snow can accumulate in short periods of time possibly causing road closures and paralyzing cities for instance on january 9 2015 a localized heavy snow squall caused a 193-vehicle pile-up on i-94 highway near galesburg michigan.6 see alsoedit warnings about lake effect snow referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

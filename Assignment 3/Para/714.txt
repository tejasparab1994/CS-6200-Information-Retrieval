lake ontario  contents  geographyedit major rivers draining into lake ontario include the niagara river don river humber river trent river cataraqui river genesee river oswego river black river little salmon river and the salmon river geologyedit historyedit artifacts which are believed to be of norse origin have been found in the area of sodus bay indicating the possibility of trading by the indigenous peoples with norse explorers on the east coast of north america.19 in the late 19th and early 20th centuries a type of scow known as a stone hooker was in operation on the north-west shore particularly around port credit and bronte stonehooking was the practice of raking flat fragments of dundas shale from the shallow lake floor of the area for use in construction particularly in the growing city of toronto.20 ecology and environmental concernsedit the great lakes watershed is a region of high biodiversity and lake ontario is important for its diversity of birds fish reptiles amphibians and plants many of these special species are associated with shorelines particularly sand dunes lagoons and wetlands the importance of wetlands to the lake has been appreciated and many of the larger wetlands have protected status however these wetlands are changing in part because the natural water level fluctuations have been reduced many wetland plants are dependent upon low water levels to reproduce.21 when water levels are stabilized the area and diversity of the marsh is reduced this is particularly true of meadow marsh also known as wet meadow wetlands for example in eel bay near alexandria bay regulation of lake levels has resulted in large losses of wet meadow.22 often this is accompanied by the invasion of cattails which displace many of the native plant species and reduce plant diversity eutrophication may accelerate this process by providing nitrogen and phosphorus for the more rapid growth of competitively dominant plants.23 similar effects are occurring on the north shore in wetlands such as presqu'ile which have interdunal wetlands called pannes with high plant diversity and many unusual plant species.24 most of the forests around the lake are deciduous forests dominated by trees including maple oak beech ash and basswood these are classified as part of the mixedwood plains ecozone by environment canada or as the eastern great lakes and hudson lowlands by the united states environmental protection agency or as the great lakes ecoregion by the nature conservancy.25 deforestation in the vicinity of the lake has had many negative impacts26 including loss of forest birds extinction of native salmon and increased amounts of sediment flowing into the lake in some areas more than 90 percent of the forest cover has been removed and replaced by agriculture certain tree species such as hemlock have also been particularly depleted by past logging activity.27 guidelines for restoration stress the importance of maintaining and restoring forest cover particularly along streams and wetlands.2829 the open water is less-affected by shoreline features such as wetlands and more affected by nutrient levels that control the production of algae algae are the basis of the open water food web and the source of primary production that ends up as lake trout and walleye at the top of the open water food web this food web has been damaged not only by over-fishing and changes in nutrient levels but also by other types of pollution from industrial chemicals agricultural fertilizers untreated sewage phosphates from laundry detergents and pesticides some pollutant chemicals that have been found in the lake include ddt benzoapyrene and other pesticides pcbs aramite chromium lead mirex mercury and carbon tetrachloride the international joint commission has identified areas where pollution is particularly intense point sources and mapped them as areas of concern a remedial action plan has been developed for each area some lake ontario areas of concern include the oswego river and rochester embayment on the american side and hamilton harbour and toronto on the canadian side.citation needed by the 1960s and 1970s the increased pollution caused frequent algal blooms to occur in the summer.8 these blooms killed large numbers of fish and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores.31 at times the blooms became so thick that waves could not break fish eating birds such as osprey bald eagle and cormorant were being poisoned by contaminated fish since the 1960s and 1970s environmental concerns have forced a cleanup of industrial and municipal wastes cleanup has been accomplished through better treatment plants tighter environmental regulations deindustrialization and increased public awareness today lake ontario has recovered some of its pristine quality for example walleye a fish species considered as a marker of clean water are now found however regional airshed pollution remains a concern the lake has also become an important sport fishery although with introduced species coho and chinook salmon rather than the native species bald eagle and osprey populations are also beginning to recover invasive species are a problem for lake ontario particularly lamprey and zebra mussels lamprey are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed zebra mussels in particular are difficult to control and pose major challenges for the lake and its waterways climateedit lake breezes in spring tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past and in the autumn delay the onset of fall frost particularly on the south shore cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season protecting them from possible frost damage such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area apples cherries pears plums and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around rochester between stoney creek and niagara-on-the-lake on the niagara peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area the wine-growing region extends over the international border into niagara and orleans counties apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake's north shore around cobourg settlementsedit a high-speed passenger/vehicle ferry the spirit of ontario i operated between toronto and rochester from june 17 2004 to january 10 2006 when the

navigationedit the great lakes waterway connects the lake sidestream to the atlantic ocean via the st lawrence seaway and upstream to the other rivers in the chain via the welland canal and to lake erie the trent-severn waterway for pleasure boats connects lake ontario at the bay of quinte to georgian bay lake huron via lake simcoe the oswego canal connects the lake at oswego to the new york state canal system with outlets to the hudson river lake erie and lake champlain the rideau canal also for pleasure boats connects lake ontario at kingston to the ottawa river in downtown ottawa lighthousesedit islandsedit nearly all of lake ontario's islands are located on the eastern and north-eastern shores between the prince edward county headland and the lake's outlet at kingston the toronto islands on the north-western shore are the remnants of a sand spit formed by coastal erosion whereas the mostly larger eastern islands are underlain by the basement rock found throughout the region wolfe island located near kingston at the st lawrence outlet is the largest island in the basin it is accessible by ferry from both canada and the u.s other topicsedit the great lakes circle tour and seaway trail are designated scenic road systems connecting all of the great lakes and the st lawrence river.34 as the seaway trail is posted on the u.s side only lake ontario is the only of the five great lakes to have no posted bi-national circle tour in the 1800s there were reports of an alleged creature similar to the so-called loch ness monster being sighted in the lake the creature is described as large with a long neck green in colour and generally causes a break in the surface waves.353637 swims across the lakeedit as of 2012update nearly 50 people have successfully swum across the lake.38 the first person who accomplished the feat was marilyn bell who did it in 1954 at the age of 16 toronto's marilyn bell park is named in her honour the park opened in 1984 and is located just to the east of the spot where bell completed her swim.39 in 1974 diana nyad became the first person who swam across the lake against the current from north to south.40 on august 28 2007 14-year-old natalie lambert from kingston ontario made the swim leaving sackets harbor new york and reaching kingston's confederation basin less than 24 hours after she entered the lake.41 on august 19 2012 14-year-old annaleise carr became the youngest person to swim across the lake she completed the 32-mile 52-km crossing from niagara-on-the-lake to marilyn bell park in just under 27 hours.42 industrialisationedit while the great lakes once supported an industrial-scale fishery with record hauls in 1899 overfishing later blighted the industry.45 today only recreational fishing activities

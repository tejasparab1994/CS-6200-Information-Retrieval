tropopause the tropopause is the boundary in the earth's atmosphere between the troposphere and the stratosphere it is a thermodynamic gradient stratification layer marking the end of troposphere  contents  definitionedit going upward from the surface it is the point where air ceases to cool with height and becomes almost completely dry more formally the tropopause is the region of the atmosphere where the environmental lapse rate changes from positive as it behaves in the troposphere to the stratospheric negative one following is the exact definition used by the world meteorological organization the tropopause as defined above renders as a first-order discontinuity surface that is temperature as a function of height varies continuously through the atmosphere but the temperature gradient does not.2 locationedit given that the lapse rate is not a conservative quantity when the tropopause is considered for stratosphere-troposphere exchanges studies there exists an alternative definition named dynamic tropopause.6 it is formed with the aid of potential vorticity which is defined as the product of the isentropic density i.e the density that arises from using potential temperature as the vertical coordinate and the absolute vorticity given that this quantity attains quite different values for the troposphere and the stratosphere.7 instead of using the vertical temperature gradient as the defining variable the dynamic tropopause surface is expressed in potential vorticity units pvu.nb 1 given that the absolute vorticity is positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere the threshold value should be taken as positive north of the equator and negative south of it.9 theoretically to define a global tropopause in this way the two surfaces arising from the positive and negative thresholds need to be matched near the equator using another type of surface such as a constant potential temperature surface nevertheless the dynamic tropopause is useless at equatorial latitudes because the isentropes are almost vertical.8 for the extratropical tropopause in the northern hemisphere the wmo established a value of 1.5 pvu8 but greater values ranging between 2 and 3.5 pvu have been traditionally used.10 it is also possible to define the tropopause in terms of chemical composition.11 for example the lower stratosphere has much higher ozone concentrations than the upper troposphere but much lower water vapor concentrations so appropriate cutoffs can be used phenomenaedit the tropopause is not a hard boundary vigorous thunderstorms for example particularly those of tropical origin will overshoot into the lower stratosphere and undergo a brief hour-order or less low-frequency vertical oscillation.12 such oscillation sets up a low-frequency atmospheric gravity wave capable of affecting both atmospheric and oceanic currents in the region.citation needed most commercial aircraft are flown in the lower stratosphere just above the tropopause where clouds are usually absent as also are significant weather perturbations.13 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

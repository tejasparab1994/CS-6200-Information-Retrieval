atlantic hurricane season the atlantic hurricane season is the period in a year when hurricanes usually form in the atlantic ocean tropical cyclones in the north atlantic are called hurricanes tropical storms or tropical depressions in addition there have been several storms over the years that have not been fully tropical and are categorized as subtropical depressions and subtropical storms even though subtropical storms and subtropical depressions are not technically as strong as tropical cyclones the damages can still be devastating worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest however each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active.1 in the northern atlantic ocean a distinct hurricane season occurs from june 1 to november 30 sharply peaking from late august through september;1 the season's climatological peak of activity occurs around september 10 each season.2 this is the norm but in 1938 the atlantic hurricane season started as early as january 3  contents  conceptedit the basic concept of a hurricane season began during 19354 when dedicated wire circuits known as hurricane circuits began to be set up along the gulf and atlantic coasts5 a process completed by 1955.6 it was originally the time frame when the tropics were monitored routinely for tropical cyclone activity and was originally defined as from june 15 through october 31.7 over the years the beginning date was shifted back to june 1 while the end date was shifted to november 155 before settling at november 30 by 1965.89 this was when hurricane reconnaissance planes were sent out to fly across the atlantic and gulf of mexico on a routine basis to look for potential tropical cyclones in the years before the continuous weather satellite era.7 since regular satellite surveillance began hurricane hunter aircraft fly only into storm areas which are first spotted by satellite imagery.10 operationsedit during the hurricane season the national hurricane center routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season special tropical weather outlooks will be issued.11 routine coordination occurs at 1700 utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future.12 possible tropical cyclones are depicted with a closed isobar while systems with less certainty to develop are depicted as spot lows with no isobar surrounding them hurdatedit hurdat was not designed with all of these uses in mind when it was first put together and not all of them may be appropriate given its original motivation hurdat contains numerous systematic as well as some random errors in the database additionally analysis techniques have changed over the years at nhc as their understanding of tropical cyclones has developed leading to biases in the historical database another difficulty in applying the hurricane database to studies concerned with landfalling events is the lack of exact location time and intensity at hurricane landfall re-analysis projectedit hurdat is regularly updated annually to reflect the previous season's activity the older portion of the database has been regularly revised since 2001 the first time in 2001 led to the addition of tropical cyclone tracks for the years 1851 to 1885 the second time was august 2002 when hurricane andrew was upgraded to a category 5 recent efforts into uncovering undocumented historical hurricanes in the late 19th and 20th centuries by various researchers have greatly increased our knowledge of these past events possible changes for the years 1951 onward are not yet incorporated into the hurdat database because of all of these issues a re-analysis of the atlantic hurricane database is being attempted that will be completed in three years in addition to the groundbreaking work by partagascontext? additional analyses digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the noaa hurricane research division funded by the noaa office of global programs this re-analysis will continue to progress through the remainder of the 20th century.13 the national hurricane center's best track change committee has approved changes for a few recent cyclones such as hurricane andrew official changes to the atlantic hurricane database are approved by the national hurricane center best track change committee thus research conducted by chris landsea and colleagues as part of the atlantic hurricane database reanalysis project are submitted through this review process not all landsea's recommendations are accepted by the committee 1494-1850 pre-hurdat eraedit 1850-1899 1851-present hurdat eraedit 1850sedit 1860sedit 1870sedit 1880sedit 1890sedit 1900sedit note in the following tables all estimates of damage costs are expressed in contemporaneous us dollars usd 1900sedit 1910sedit 1920sedit 1930sedit 1940sedit 1950sedit 1960sedit 1970sedit 1980sedit 1990sedit 2000sedit note in the following tables all estimates of damage costs are expressed in contemporaneous us dollars usd 2000sedit 2010sedit number of tropical storms and hurricanes per seasonedit this bar chart shows the number of named storms and hurricanes per year from 1851-2017 a 2011 study analyzing one of the main sources of hurricanes  the african easterly wave aew  found that the change in aews is closely linked to increased activity of intense hurricanes in the north atlantic the synoptic concurrence of aews in driving the dynamics of the sahel greening also appears to increase tropical cyclogenesis over the north atlantic.17 see alsoedit parent topicsedit atlantic hurricane topicsedit other tropical cyclone basinsedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

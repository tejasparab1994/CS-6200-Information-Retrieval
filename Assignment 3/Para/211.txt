international date line the international date line idl is an imaginary line of navigation on the surface of the earth that runs from the north pole to the south pole and demarcates the change of one calendar day to the next it passes through the middle of the pacific ocean roughly following the 180 line of longitude but deviating to pass around some territories and island groups  contents  geographyedit descriptionedit the idl is roughly based on the meridian of 180 longitude roughly down the middle of the pacific ocean and halfway around the world from the greenwich meridian in many places the idl follows the 180 meridian exactly in other places however the idl deviates east or west away from that meridian these various deviations generally accommodate the political and/or economic affiliations of the affected areas circumnavigating the globeedit a person who goes around the world from east to west the same direction as magellan's voyage would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15 of longitude crossed and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe from east to west if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one day when they crossed the idl in contrast a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15 of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the idl the idl must therefore be observed in conjunction with the earth's time zones on crossing it in either direction the calendar date is adjusted by one day facts dependent on the idledit according to the clock the first areas to experience a new day and a new year are islands that use utc+14 these include portions of the republic of kiribati including millennium island in the line islands as well as samoa during the southern summer the first major cities to experience a new day are auckland and wellington new zealand utc+12 utc+13 with daylight saving time a 1995 realignment of the idl made caroline island one of the first points of land on earth to reach january 1 2000 on the calendar utc+14 as a result this atoll was renamed millennium island.4 the areas that are the first to see the daylight of a new day vary by the season around the june solstice the first area would be anyplace within the kamchatka time zone utc+12 that is far enough north to experience midnight sun on the given date at the equinoxes the first place to see daylight would be the uninhabited millennium island in kiribati which is the easternmost land located west of the idl near the december solstice the first places would be antarctic research stations using new zealand time utc+13 during summer that experience midnight sun these include amundsen-scott south pole station mcmurdo station scott base and mario zucchelli station.5 de facto and de jure date linesedit there are two ways time zones and thereby the location of the international date line are determined one on land and adjacent territorial waters and the other on open seas all nations unilaterally determine their standard time zones applicable only on land and adjacent territorial waters this date line can be called de facto since it is not based on international law but on national laws these national zones do not extend into international waters cartographic practice and conventionedit no international organization nor any treaty between nations has fixed the idl drawn by cartographers the 1884 international meridian conference explicitly refused to propose or agree to any time zones stating that they were outside its purview the conference resolved that the universal day midnight-to-midnight greenwich mean time now known as coordinated universal time or utc which it did agree to shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable.9 from this comes the utility and importance of utc or z zulu time it permits a single universal reference for time that is valid for all points on the globe at the same moment historical alterationsedit philippines 1521 and 1844edit as part of new spain the philippines long had its most important communication with acapulco in mexico and was accordingly on the east side of the idl despite being at the far western edge of the pacific ocean from 1521 to 1844 the philippines was one day behind its asian neighbors 1521 was the first european visit when ferdinand magellan claimed the area for spain colonization began in 1565 after mexico gained its independence from spain in 1821 philippine trade interests turned to imperial china the dutch east indies and adjacent areas so the philippines decided to shift back to the west side of the idl by removing tuesday 31 december 1844 from its calendar.10 the change was also applied to mariana islands guam and caroline islands since they also belonged to spain.11 because of this change new year's eve happened on monday 30 december 1844 effective wednesday 1 january 1845 the philippines guam mariana islands and caroline islands switched back to asian date western publications were generally unaware of this change until the early 1890s so erroneously gave the international date line a large western bulge for the next half century.12 alaska 1740s and 1867edit samoan islands and tokelau 1892 and 2011edit the samoan islands now divided into samoa and american samoa were on the west side of the idl until 1892 in that year king malietoa laupepa was persuaded by american traders to adopt the american date three hours behind california to replace the former asian date four hours ahead of japan the change was made by repeating 4 july 1892 american independence day.15 the idl now passes between samoa and american samoa which remains on the east american side of the line tokelau is a territory of new zealand north of samoa whose principal transportation and communications links with the rest of the world pass through samoa for that reason tokelau crossed the idl along with samoa in 2011.19 kwajalein c 1945 and 1993edit kwajalein atoll like the rest of the marshall islands passed from spanish to german to japanese control during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries during that period it was west of the idl although kwajalein formally became part of the trust territory of the pacific islands with the rest of the marshalls after world war ii the united states established a military installation there because of that kwajalein used the hawaiian date so was effectively east of the international date line unlike the rest of the marshalls kwajalein returned to the west side of the idl by removing saturday 21 august 1993 from its calendar to match the dates used by the rest of the marshall islands at the request of its government along with the shift kwajalein's work week was changed to tuesday through saturday to match the hawaiian work week of monday through friday on the other side of the idl.20 eastern kiribati 1995edit as a british colony the now-republic of kiribati was centred in the gilbert islands just west of the idl of the time upon independence in 1979 it acquired the phoenix and line islands east of the idl from the united states as a result the country straddled the idl government and commercial concerns on opposite sides of the line could only conduct routine business by radio or telephone on the four days of the week which were weekdays on both sides to eliminate this anomaly kiribati introduced a change of date for its eastern half on sunday 1 january 1995 after the change the idl in effect moved eastwards to go around the entire country strictly legal the 1917 nautical idl convention is still valid when the land time zone says it's monday these islands would form enclaves of monday in an ocean which has sunday maps are usually not drawn this way as a consequence of the 1995 change kiribati's easternmost territory the line islands including the inhabited island of kiritimati christmas island started the year 2000 before any other country a feature the kiribati government capitalized upon as a potential tourist draw date lines according to religious principlesedit christianityedit generally the christian calendar and christian churches recognize the authority of the idl christmas for example is celebrated on 25 december according to either the gregorian or the julian calendar depending upon which of the two is used by the particular church as that date falls in countries located on either side of the date line thus whether it is western christmas or orthodox christmas christians in samoa immediately west of the date line will celebrate the holiday a day before christians in american samoa which is immediately east of the date line a problem with the general rule above arises in certain christian churches that solemnly observe a sabbath day as a particular day of the week when those churches are located in countries near the date line notwithstanding the difference in dates the same sunrise happened over american samoa as happens over samoa a few minutes later and the same sunset happens over samoa as happened over american samoa a few minutes earlier in other words the secular days are legally different but they are physically the same and that causes questions to arise under religious law because the date line was an arbitrary imposition the question can arise as to which saturday on either side of the date line or more fundamentally on either side of 180 degrees longitude is the real saturday this issue which also arises in judaism is a particular problem for seventh day adventists seventh day baptists and similar churches located in countries near the date line in tonga seventh day adventists who usually observe saturday the seventh-day sabbath observe sunday due to their understanding of the international date line as tonga lies east of the 180 meridian sunday as observed in tonga as with kiribati samoa and parts of fiji and tuvalu is considered by the seventh-day adventist church to be the same day as saturday observed in most other places.2122 most seventh day adventists in samoa planned to observe sabbath on sunday after samoa's crossing the date line in december 2011 but sda groups in samatau village and other places approx 300 members decided to accept the idl adjustment and observe the sabbath on saturday.23 debate continues within the seventh-day adventist community in the pacific as to which day is really the seventh-day sabbath the samoan independent seventh-day adventist church which is not affiliated to the worldwide seventh-day adventist church has decided to continue worshiping on saturday after a six-day week at the end of 2011 islamedit similarly the islamic calendar and muslim communities recognize the convention of the idl in particular the day for holding the jumu'ah prayer appears to be local friday everywhere in the world.26 judaismedit the concept of an international date line in jewish law is first mentioned by 12th-century decisors.2829 but it was not until the introduction of improved transportation and communications systems in the 20th century that the question of an international date line truly became a question of practical jewish law.30 for individuals crossing the date line the change of calendar date influences some aspects of practice under jewish law yet other aspects depend on an individual's experience of sunsets and sunrises to count days notwithstanding the calendar date.2829 cultural references and traditionsedit the island of the day beforeedit the date line is a central factor in umberto eco's book the island of the day before 1994 in which the protagonist finds himself on a becalmed ship with an island close at hand on the other side of the idl unable to swim the protagonist indulges in increasingly confused speculation regarding the physical metaphysical and religious import of the date line around the world in eighty daysedit fogg had thought it was one day more than it actually was because he had forgotten this simple fact during his journey he had added a full day to his clock at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees or four minutes per degree as verne writes at the time the concept of a de jure international date line did not exist if it did he would have been made aware that it would be a day less than it used to be once he reached this line thus the day he would add to his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line but a de facto date line did exist since the uk india and the us had the same calendar with different local times and he should have noticed when he arrived to the us that the local date was not the same as in his diary his servant jean passepartout kept his clock in london time despite the tips of his surroundings line-crossing ceremonies relating to the idledit ceremonies aboard ships to mark a sailor's or passenger's first crossing of the equator as well as crossing the international date line have been long-held traditions in navies and in other maritime services around the world mathematical descriptionedit the need for a temporal discontinuity on the globe can be described mathematically as following from the borsuk-ulam theorem in dimension 1 it is a topological fact that there does not exist any continuous one-to-one function mapping from a circle onto an interval.36

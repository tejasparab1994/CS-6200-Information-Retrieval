world energy consumption world energy consumption is the total energy used by the entire human civilization typically measured per year it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector across every country it does not include energy from food and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented being the power source metric of civilization world energy consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere institutions such as the international energy agency iea the u.s energy information administration eia and the european environment agency record and publish energy data periodically improved data and understanding of world energy consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions in 2011 expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion usd or about 10 of the world gross domestic product gdp europe spends close to one-quarter of the world's energy expenditures north america close to 20% and japan 6%.4 contents overviewedit energy supply consumption and electricityedit world total primary energy supply tpes or primary energy differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers for instance when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline so that it can be used in a car and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers world final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity 2014 world electricity generation 23816 twh by source iea 201613 trendsedit the energy consumption growth in the g20 slowed down to 2 in 2011 after the strong increase of 2010 the economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth for several years now the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish chinese and indian markets while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies high oil prices resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.18 according to iea data from 1990 to 2008 the average energy use per person increased 10 while world population increased 27% regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008 the middle east increased by 170% china by 146% india by 91% africa by 70% latin america by 66% the usa by 20% the eu-27 block by 7% and world overall grew by 39% energy consumption in the g20 increased by more than 5 in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009 in 2009 world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1% or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent mtoe as a result of the financial and economic crisis which reduced world gdp by 0.6 in 2009.21 this evolution is the result of two contrasting trends energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries specifically in asia +4% conversely in oecd consumption was severely cut by 4.7 in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels in north america europe and the cis consumptions shrank by 4.5% 5 and 8.5 respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity china became the world's largest energy consumer 18 of the total since its consumption surged by 8 during 2009 up from 4 in 2008 oil remained the largest energy source 33% despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption in 2009 it accounted for 27 of the total emissionsedit global warming emissions resulting from energy production are an environmental problem efforts to resolve this include the kyoto protocol which is a un agreement aiming to reduce harmful climate impacts which a number of nations have signed limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees celsius thought to be a risk by the sei is now doubtful to limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees celsius rise would demand a 75 decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050 if the population is 10 billion in 2050.28 across 40 years this averages to a 2 decrease every year in 2011 the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem hypothetically according to robert engelman worldwatch institute in order to prevent collapse human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population 2009.29 greenhouse gases are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption large amounts of pollutants such as sulphurous oxides sox nitrous oxides nox and particulate matter pm are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution.30 biomass combustion is a major contributor.303132 in addition to producing air pollution like fossil fuel combustion most biomass has high co2 emissions.33 by sourceedit total primary energy supply of 13699 mega-toe by source in 2014 iea 2016137:28 fossil fuelsedit coaledit in 2000 china accounted for 28 of world coal consumption other asia consumed 19% north america 25 and the eu 14% the single greatest coal-consuming country is china its share of the world coal production was 28 in 2000 and rose to 48 in 2009 in contrast to china's ~70 increase in coal consumption world coal use increased 48 from 2000 to 2009 in practice the majority of this growth occurred in china and the rest in other asia.34 china's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector the majority of which comes from coal consumption.35 if production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008 proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years this is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world according to james hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce co2 emissions from coal.37 indonesia and australia exported together 57.1 of the world coal export in 2011 china japan south korea india and taiwan had 65 share of all the world coal import in 2011.38 oiledit coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century with the advent of the automobile aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity oil became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century the growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973 after the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 us dollars per barrel there was a shift away from oil.41 coal natural gas and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency in the u.s the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon japan which bore the brunt of the oil shocks made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world.42 from 1965 to 2008 the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased from 2003 to 2008 coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.43 it is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present.44 natural gasedit nuclear poweredit as of 1 july 2016 the world had 444 operable grid-electric nuclear power reactors with 62 others under construction.46 since commercial nuclear energy began in the mid 1950s 2008 was the first year that no new nuclear power plant was connected to the grid although two were connected in 2009.4748 renewable energyedit renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources that are not significantly depleted by their use such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat.50 renewable energy is gradually replacing conventional fuels in four distinct areas electricity generation hot water/space heating motor fuels and rural off-grid energy services.51 based on ren21's 2014 report renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013 respectively this energy consumption is divided as 9 coming from traditional biomass 4.2 as heat energy non-biomass 3.8 hydro electricity and 2 electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us$214 billion in 2013 with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind hydro solar and biofuels.52 renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits.53 in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power.54 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.55 the following table shows increasing nameplate capacity and has capacity factors that range from 11 for solar to 40 for hydropower.56 from 2000 to 2013 the total renewable energy use has increased 6450 twh and total energy use 40500 twh hydroedit marine energyedit windedit solaredit solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies solar energy technologies include solar heating solar photovoltaics concentrated solar power and solar architecture which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces the international energy agency projected that solar power could provide a third of the global final energy demand after 2060 while co2 emissions would be reduced to very low levels.76 solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air from 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3 of global energy.77 geothermaledit bio energyedit by countryedit world total final consumption of 13699 mtoe by region in 2014 iea 201613 one measurement of efficiency is

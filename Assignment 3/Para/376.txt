radiocarbon dating radiocarbon dating also referred to as carbon dating or carbon-14 dating is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon 14c a radioactive isotope of carbon the method was developed by willard libby in the late 1940s and soon became a standard tool for archaeologists libby received the nobel prize in chemistry for his work in 1960 the radiocarbon dating method is based on the fact that radiocarbon is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen the resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis animals then acquire 14c by eating the plants when the animal or plant dies it stops exchanging carbon with its environment and from that point onwards the amount of 14c it contains begins to decrease as the 14c undergoes radioactive decay measuring the amount of 14c in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died the older a sample is the less 14c there is to be detected and because the half-life of 14c the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed is about 5730 years the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50000 years ago although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples the idea behind radiocarbon dating is straightforward but years of work were required to develop the technique to the point where accurate dates could be obtained research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of 14c in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years the resulting data in the form of a calibration curve is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of 14c in different types of organisms fractionation and the varying levels of 14c throughout the biosphere reservoir effects additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its 14c to decay below detectable levels fossil fuels contain almost no 14c and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of 14c in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century conversely nuclear testing increased the amount of 14c in the atmosphere which attained a maximum in 1963 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta-counting devices which counted the amount of beta radiation emitted by decaying 14c atoms in a sample more recently accelerator mass spectrometry has become the method of choice it counts all the 14c atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements it can therefore be used with much smaller samples as small as individual plant seeds and gives results much more quickly the development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeology in addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as the radiocarbon revolution radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated such as the end of the last ice age and the beginning of the neolithic and bronze age in different regions  contents  backgroundedit historyedit in 1939 martin kamen and samuel ruben of the radiation laboratory at berkeley began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research they synthesized 14c using the laboratory's cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom's half-life was far longer than had been previously thought.1 this was followed by a prediction by serge a korff then employed at the franklin institute in philadelphia that the interaction of slow neutrons with 14n in the upper atmosphere would create 14c.23 it had previously been thought that 14c would be more likely to be created by deuterons interacting with 13c.1 at some time during world war ii willard libby who was then at berkeley learned of korff's research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.24 in 1945 libby moved to the university of chicago where he began his work on radiocarbon dating he published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include 14c as well as non-radioactive carbon.56 libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with methane collected from sewage works in baltimore and after isotopically enriching their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained radioactive 14c by contrast methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age the results were summarized in a paper in science in 1947 in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.57 libby and james arnold proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages for example two samples taken from the tombs of two egyptian kings zoser and sneferu independently dated to 2625 bc plus or minus 75 years were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 bc plus or minus 250 years these results were published in science in 1949.89 within 11 years of their announcement more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide.10 in 1960 libby was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for this work.5 physical and chemical detailsedit in nature carbon exists as two stable nonradioactive isotopes carbon-12 12c and carbon-13 13c and a radioactive isotope carbon-14 14c also known as radiocarbon the half-life of 14c the time it takes for half of a given amount of 14c to decay is about 5730 years so its concentration in the atmosphere might be expected to reduce over thousands of years but 14c is constantly being produced in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere by cosmic rays which generate neutrons that in turn create 14c when they strike nitrogen-14 14n atoms.5 the following nuclear reaction creates 14c where n represents a neutron and p represents a proton.11 once produced the 14c quickly combines with the oxygen in the atmosphere to form carbon dioxide co2 carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in the atmosphere is dissolved in the ocean and is taken up by plants via photosynthesis animals eat the plants and ultimately the radiocarbon is distributed throughout the biosphere the ratio of 14c to 12c is approximately 1.5 parts of 14c to 1012 parts of 12c.12 in addition about 1 of the carbon atoms are of the stable isotope 13c.5 the equation for the radioactive decay of 14c is:13 principlesedit the equation governing the decay of a radioactive isotope is:5 the sample is assumed to have originally had the same 14c/12c ratio as the ratio in the atmosphere and since the size of the sample is known the total number of atoms in the sample can be calculated yielding n0 the number of 14c atoms in the original sample measurement of n the number of 14c atoms currently in the sample allows the calculation of t the age of the sample using the equation above.12 the half-life of a radioactive isotope usually denoted by t1/2 is a more familiar concept than the mean-life so although the equations above are expressed in terms of the mean-life it is more usual to quote the value of 14c's half-life than its mean-life.note 1 the currently accepted value for the half-life of 14c is 5730 years.5 this means that after 5730 years only half of the initial 14c will remain a quarter will remain after 11460 years an eighth after 17190 years and so on the above calculations make several assumptions such as that the level of 14c in the atmosphere has remained constant over time.5 in fact the level of 14c in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources.16 this is done by calibration curves which convert a measurement of 14c in a sample into an estimated calendar age the calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the radiocarbon age which is the age in radiocarbon years of the sample an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used  the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the 14c/12c ratio has not changed over time calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for 14c which for more than a decade after libby's initial work was thought to be 5568 years this was revised in the early 1960s to 5730 years which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect the error in the half-life is about 3% for consistency with these early papers and to avoid the risk of a double correction for the incorrect half-life radiocarbon ages are still calculated using the incorrect half-life value a correction for the half-life is incorporated into calibration curves so even though radiocarbon ages are calculated using a half-life value that is known to be incorrect the final reported calibrated date in calendar years is accurate when a date is quoted the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of 14c and because no correction calibration has been applied for the historical variation of 14c in the atmosphere over time.1718note 2 carbon exchange reservoiredit carbon is distributed throughout the atmosphere the biosphere and the oceans these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir21 and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir the different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store and in how long it takes for the 14c generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them this affects the ratio of 14c to 12c in the different reservoirs and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir.5 the atmosphere which is where 14c is generated contains about 1.9 of the total carbon in the reservoirs and the 14c it contains mixes in less than seven years.2022 the ratio of 14c to 12c in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs if another reservoir has a lower ratio of 14c to 12c it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that some of the 14c has decayed.16 the ocean surface is an example it contains 2.4 of the carbon in the exchange reservoir20 but there is only about 95 as much 14c as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere.5 the time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years23 but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean which has more than 90 of the carbon in the reservoir.16 water in the deep ocean takes about 1000 years to circulate back through surface waters and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water with depleted 14c and water recently at the surface with 14c in equilibrium with the atmosphere.16 creatures living at the ocean surface have the same 14c ratios as the water they live in and as a result of the reduced 14c/12c ratio the radiocarbon age of marine life is typically about 440 years.2425note 4 organisms on land are in closer equilibrium with the atmosphere and have the same 14c/12c ratio as the atmosphere.5 these organisms contain about 1.3 of the carbon in the reservoir sea organisms have a mass of less than 1 of those on land and are not shown on the diagram.20 accumulated dead organic matter of both plants and animals exceeds the mass of the biosphere by a factor of nearly 3 and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment it has a 14c/12c ratio lower than that of the biosphere.5 dating considerationsedit the variation in the 14c/12c ratio in different parts of the carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of the age of a sample based on the amount of 14c it contains will often give an incorrect result there are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered the errors are of four general types atmospheric variationedit in the early years of using the technique it was understood that it depended on the atmospheric 14c/12c ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years to verify the accuracy of the method several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects over time however discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of egyptian artefacts neither the pre-existing egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate but a third possibility was that the 14c/12c ratio had changed over time the question was resolved by the study of tree rings:262728 comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree-ring data that spanned 8000 years.26 since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13900 years.29 in the 1960s hans suess was able to use the tree-ring sequence to show that the dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with the dates assigned by egyptologists this was possible because although annual plants such as corn have a 14c/12c ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year while the inner tree rings don't get their 14c replenished and instead start losing 14c through decay hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric 14c/12c ratio of the year it grew in carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric 14c/12c ratio with a sample of known date and a measurement of the value of n the number of atoms of 14c remaining in the sample the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of n0  the number of atoms of 14c in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed  and hence the 14c/12c ratio in the atmosphere at that time.2628 equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the 14c/12c ratio.30 these curves are described in more detail below coal and oil began to be burned in large quantities during the 19th century both are sufficiently old that they contain little detectable 14c and as a result the co2 released substantially diluted the atmospheric 14c/12c ratio dating an object from the early 20th century hence gives an apparent date older than the true date for the same reason 14c concentrations in the neighbourhood of large cities are lower than the atmospheric average this fossil fuel effect also known as the suess effect after hans suess who first reported it in 1955 would only amount to a reduction of 0.2 in 14c activity if the additional carbon from fossil fuels were distributed throughout the carbon exchange reservoir but because of the long delay in mixing with the deep ocean the actual effect is a 3 reduction.2633 a much larger effect comes from above-ground nuclear testing which released large numbers of neutrons and created 14c from about 1950 until 1963 when atmospheric nuclear testing was banned it is estimated that several tonnes of 14c were created if all this extra 14c had immediately been spread across the entire carbon exchange reservoir it would have led to an increase in the 14c/12c ratio of only a few per cent but the immediate effect was to almost double the amount of 14c in the atmosphere with the peak level occurring in about 1965 the level has since dropped as this bomb pulse or bomb carbon as it is sometimes called percolates into the rest of the reservoir.263334 isotopic fractionationedit photosynthesis is the primary process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into living things in photosynthetic pathways 12c is absorbed slightly more easily than 13c which in turn is more easily absorbed than 14c the differential uptake of the three carbon isotopes leads to 13c/12c and 14c/12c ratios in plants that differ from the ratios in the atmosphere this effect is known as isotopic fractionation.3536 the carbon exchange between atmospheric co2 and carbonate at the ocean surface is also subject to fractionation with 14c in the atmosphere more likely than 12c to dissolve in the ocean the result is an overall increase in the 14c/12c ratio in the ocean of 1.5% relative to the 14c/12c ratio in the atmosphere this increase in 14c concentration almost exactly cancels out the decrease caused by the upwelling of water containing old and hence 14c depleted carbon from the deep ocean so that direct measurements of 14c radiation are similar to measurements for the rest of the biosphere correcting for isotopic fractionation as is done for all radiocarbon dates to allow comparison between results from different parts of the biosphere gives an apparent age of about 440 years for ocean surface water.1625 reservoir effectsedit libby's original exchange reservoir hypothesis assumed that the 14c/12c ratio in the exchange reservoir is constant all over the world40 but it has since been discovered that there are several causes of variation in the ratio across the reservoir.24 marine effect hemisphere effect the northern and southern hemispheres have atmospheric circulation systems that are sufficiently independent of each other that there is a noticeable time lag in mixing between the two the atmospheric 14c/12c ratio is lower in the southern hemisphere with an apparent additional age of 30 years for radiocarbon results from the south as compared to the north this is probably because the greater surface area of ocean in the southern hemisphere means that there is more carbon exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere than in the north since the surface ocean is depleted in 14c because of the marine effect 14c is removed from the southern atmosphere more quickly than in the north.24 other effects if the carbon in freshwater is partly acquired from aged carbon such as rocks then the result will be a reduction in the 14c/12c ratio in the water for example rivers that pass over limestone which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate will acquire carbonate ions similarly groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed these rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable 14c so this carbon lowers the 14c/12c ratio of the water it enters which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it.16 this is known as the hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions which are characteristic of hard water other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results.24 the effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.41 contaminationedit samplesedit samples for dating need to be converted into a form suitable for measuring the 14c content this can mean conversion to gaseous liquid or solid form depending on the measurement technique to be used before this can be done the sample must be treated to remove any contamination and any unwanted constituents.43 this includes removing visible contaminants such as rootlets that may have penetrated the sample since its burial.43 alkali and acid washes can be used to remove humic acid and carbonate contamination but care has to be taken to avoid destroying or damaging the sample.44 material considerationsedit preparation and sizeedit particularly for older samples it may be useful to enrich the amount of 14c in the sample before testing this can be done with a thermal diffusion column the process takes about a month and requires a sample about ten times as large as would be needed otherwise but it allows more precise measurement of the 14c/12c ratio in old material and extends the maximum age that can be reliably reported.46 once contamination has been removed samples must be converted to a form suitable for the measuring technology to be used.47 where gas is required co2 is widely used.4748 for samples to be used in liquid scintillation counters the carbon must be in liquid form the sample is typically converted to benzene for accelerator mass spectrometry solid graphite targets are the most common although iron carbide and gaseous co2 can also be used.4749 the quantity of material needed for testing depends on the sample type and the technology being used there are two types of testing technology detectors that record radioactivity known as beta counters and accelerator mass spectrometers for beta counters a sample weighing at least 10 grams 0.35 ounces is typically required.47 accelerator mass spectrometry ams is much more sensitive and samples as small as 0.5 milligrams 0.0077 grains can be used.50 measurement and resultsedit beta countingedit libby's method was soon superseded by gas proportional counters which were less affected by bomb carbon the additional 14c created by nuclear weapons testing these counters record bursts of ionization caused by the beta particles emitted by the decaying 14c atoms the bursts are proportional to the energy of the particle so other sources of ionization such as background radiation can be identified and ignored the counters are surrounded by lead or steel shielding to eliminate background radiation and to reduce the incidence of cosmic rays in addition anticoincidence detectors are used these record events outside the counter and any event recorded simultaneously both inside and outside the counter is regarded as an extraneous event and ignored.48 the other common technology used for measuring 14c activity is liquid scintillation counting which was invented in 1950 but which had to wait until the early 1960s when efficient methods of benzene synthesis were developed to become competitive with gas counting after 1970 liquid counters became the more common technology choice for newly constructed dating laboratories the counters work by detecting flashes of light caused by the beta particles emitted by 14c as they interact with a fluorescing agent added to the benzene like gas counters liquid scintillation counters require shielding and anticoincidence counters.5556 accelerator mass spectrometryedit ams counts the atoms of 14c and 12c in a given sample determining the 14c/12c ratio directly the sample often in the form of graphite is made to emit c ions carbon atoms with a single negative charge which are injected into an accelerator the ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge the c3 ions are then passed through a magnet that curves their path the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions a particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the 14c stream but since the volume of 12c and 13c needed for calibration is too great for individual ion detection counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a faraday cup.58 some ams facilities are also able to evaluate a sample's fractionation another piece of data necessary for calculating the sample's radiocarbon age.59 the use of ams as opposed to simpler forms of mass spectrometry is necessary because of the need to distinguish the carbon isotopes from other atoms or molecules that are very close in mass such as 14n and 13ch.47 as with beta counting both blank samples and standard samples are used.58 two different kinds of blank may be measured a sample of dead carbon that has undergone no chemical processing to detect any machine background and a sample known as a process blank made from dead carbon that is processed into target material in exactly the same way as the sample which is being dated any 14c signal from the machine background blank is likely to be caused either by beams of ions that have not followed the expected path inside the detector or by carbon hydrides such as 12ch2 or 13ch a 14c signal from the process blank measures the amount of contamination introduced during the preparation of the sample these measurements are used in the subsequent calculation of the age of the sample.60 calculationsedit the calculations to be performed on the measurements taken depend on the technology used since beta counters measure the sample's radioactivity whereas ams determines the ratio of the three different carbon isotopes in the sample.60 the results from ams testing are in the form of ratios of 12c 13c and 14c which are used to calculate fm the fraction modern this is defined as the ratio between the 14c/12c ratio in the sample and the 14c/12c ratio in modern carbon which is in turn defined as the 14c/12c ratio that would have been measured in 1950 had there been no fossil fuel effect.60 once the corrected 14c/12c ratio is known a radiocarbon age is calculated using:63 age8033lnfmdisplaystyle age=-8033cdot lnfm errors and reliabilityedit the reliability of the results can be improved by lengthening the testing time for example if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of  80 years with 68 confidence then doubling the counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with only half as much 14c to be measured with the same error term of 80 years.64 radiocarbon dating is generally limited to dating samples no more than 50000 years old as samples older than that have insufficient 14c to be measurable older dates have been obtained by using special sample preparation techniques large samples and very long measurement times these techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60000 and in some cases up to 75000 years before the present.52 errors in procedure can also lead to errors in the results if 1 of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years.66 calibrationedit the calculations given above produce dates in radiocarbon years i.e dates that represent the age the sample would be if the 14c/12c ratio had been constant historically.67 although libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.68 to produce a curve that can be used to relate calendar years to radiocarbon years a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age the study of tree rings led to the first such sequence individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year these factors affect all trees in an area so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences in this way an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past the first such published sequence based on bristlecone pine tree rings was created by wesley ferguson.28 hans suess used this data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967.262768 the curve showed two types of variation from the straight line a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9000 years and a shorter term variation often referred to as wiggles with a period of decades suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by cosmic schwung by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces it was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not but they are now well-established.262769 these short term fluctuations in the calibration curve are now known as de vries effects after hessel de vries.70 a calibration curve is used by taking the radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph the point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the calendar age of the sample on the horizontal axis this is the reverse of the way the curve is constructed a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age such as a tree ring when it is tested the resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for the graph.30 bayesian statistical techniques can be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated for example if a series of radiocarbon dates is taken from different levels in a given stratigraphic sequence bayesian analysis can help determine if some of the dates should be discarded as anomalies and can use the information to improve the output probability distributions.72 when bayesian analysis was introduced its use was limited by the need to use mainframe computers to perform the calculations but the technique has since been implemented on programs available for personal computers such as oxcal.75 reporting datesedit several formats for citing radiocarbon results have been used since the first samples were dated as of 2014 the standard format required by the journal radiocarbon is as follows.76 uncalibrated dates should be reported as <laboratory> <14c year  <range bp where for example the uncalibrated date utc-2020 3510  60 bp indicates that the sample was tested by the utrecht van der graaf laboratorium where it has a sample number of 2020 and that the uncalibrated age is 3510 years before present  60 years related forms are sometimes used for example 10 ka bp means 10000 radiocarbon years before present i.e 8050 bc and 14c yr bp might be used to distinguish the uncalibrated date from a date derived from another dating method such as thermoluminescence.76 calibrated 14c dates are frequently reported as cal bp cal bc or cal ad again with bp referring to the year 1950 as the zero date.77 radiocarbon gives two options for reporting calibrated dates a common format is cal <date-range <confidence> where use in archaeologyedit interpretationedit a key concept in interpreting radiocarbon dates is archaeological association what is the true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site it frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from the object of interest but there are also many cases where this is not possible metal grave goods for example cannot be radiocarbon dated but they may be found in a grave with a coffin charcoal or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time in these cases a date for the coffin or charcoal is indicative of the date of deposition of the grave goods because of the direct functional relationship between the two there are also cases where there is no functional relationship but the association is reasonably strong for example a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.79 contamination is of particular concern when dating very old material obtained from archaeological excavations and great care is needed in the specimen selection and preparation in 2014 tom higham and co-workers suggested that many of the dates published for neanderthal artefacts are too recent because of contamination by young carbon.80 as a tree grows only the outermost tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment so the age measured for a wood sample depends on where the sample is taken from this means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled in addition if a piece of wood is used for multiple purposes there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found.81 this is often referred to as the old wood problem.5 one example is the bronze age trackway at withy bed copse in england the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway another example is driftwood which may be used as construction material it is not always possible to recognize re-use other materials can present the same problem for example bitumen is known to have been used by some neolithic communities to waterproof baskets the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory regardless of the actual age of the context so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken a separate issue related to re-use is that of lengthy use or delayed deposition for example a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age of the context in which it is deposited.81 notable applicationsedit pleistocene/holocene boundary in two creeks fossil forestedit dead sea scrollsedit impactedit soon after the publication of libby's 1949 paper in science universities around the world began establishing radiocarbon-dating laboratories and by the end of the 1950s there were more than 20 active 14c research laboratories it quickly became apparent that the principles of radiocarbon dating were valid despite certain discrepancies the causes of which then remained unknown.87 occasionally radiocarbon dating techniques date an object of popular interest for example the shroud of turin a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of jesus christ after his crucifixion three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the shroud in 1988 the results pointed to 14th-century origins raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.13 in 2016 the development of radiocarbon dating was recognized as a national historic chemical landmark for its contributions to chemistry and society by the american chemical society.94 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit sourcesedit external linksedit navigation menu

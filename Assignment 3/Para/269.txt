weather radar weather radar also called weather surveillance radar wsr and doppler weather radar is a type of radar used to locate precipitation calculate its motion and estimate its type rain snow hail etc. modern weather radars are mostly pulse-doppler radars capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to the intensity of the precipitation both types of data can be analyzed to determine the structure of storms and their potential to cause severe weather during world war ii radar operators discovered that weather was causing echoes on their screen masking potential enemy targets techniques were developed to filter them but scientists began to study the phenomenon soon after the war surplus radars were used to detect precipitation since then weather radar has evolved on its own and is now used by national weather services research departments in universities and in television newscasts raw images are routinely used and specialized software can take radar data to make short term forecasts of future positions and intensities of rain snow hail and other weather phenomena radar output is even incorporated into numerical weather prediction models to improve analyses and forecasts  contents  historyedit during world war ii military radar operators noticed noise in returned echoes due to rain snow and sleet after the war military scientists returned to civilian life or continued in the armed forces and pursued their work in developing a use for those echoes in the united states david atlas1 at first working for the air force and later for mit developed the first operational weather radars in canada j.s marshall and r.h douglas formed the stormy weather group2 in montreal marshall and his doctoral student walter palmer are well known for their work on the drop size distribution in mid-latitude rain that led to understanding of the z-r relation which correlates a given radar reflectivity with the rate at which rainwater is falling in the united kingdom research continued to study the radar echo patterns and weather elements such as stratiform rain and convective clouds and experiments were done to evaluate the potential of different wavelengths from 1 to 10 centimeters by 1950 the uk company ekco was demonstrating its airborne 'cloud and collision warning search radar equipment'.3 in 1953 donald staggs an electrical engineer working for the illinois state water survey made the first recorded radar observation of a hook echo associated with a tornadic thunderstorm.4 between 1950 and 1980 reflectivity radars which measure position and intensity of precipitation were incorporated by weather services around the world the early meteorologists had to watch a cathode ray tube during the 1970s radars began to be standardized and organized into networks the first devices to capture radar images were developed the number of scanned angles was increased to get a three-dimensional view of the precipitation so that horizontal cross-sections cappi and vertical cross-sections could be performed studies of the organization of thunderstorms were then possible for the alberta hail project in canada and national severe storms laboratory nssl in the us in particular after 2000 research on dual polarization technology moved into operational use increasing the amount of information available on precipitation type e.g rain vs snow 9 dual polarization means that microwave radiation which is polarized both horizontally and vertically with respect to the ground is emitted wide-scale deployment was done by the end of the decade or the beginning of the next in some countries such as the united states france10 and canada in april 2013 all national weather service nexrads were completely dual-polarized.11 since 2003 the u.s national oceanic and atmospheric administration has been experimenting with phased-array radar as a replacement for conventional parabolic antenna to provide more time resolution in atmospheric sounding this could be significant with severe thunderstorms as their evolution can be better evaluated with more timely data also in 2003 the national science foundation established the engineering research center for collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere casa a multidisciplinary multi-university collaboration of engineers computer scientists meteorologists and sociologists to conduct fundamental research develop enabling technology and deploy prototype engineering systems designed to augment existing radar systems by sampling the generally undersampled lower troposphere with inexpensive fast scanning dual polarization mechanically scanned and phased array radars how a weather radar worksedit sending radar pulsesedit listening for return signalsedit between each pulse the radar station serves as a receiver as it listens for return signals from particles in the air the duration of the listen cycle is on the order of a millisecond which is a thousand times longer than the pulse duration the length of this phase is determined by the need for the microwave radiation which travels at the speed of light to propagate from the detector to the weather target and back again a distance which could be several hundred kilometers the horizontal distance from station to target is calculated simply from the amount of time that elapses from the initiation of the pulse to the detection of the return signal the time is converted into distance by multiplying by the speed of light in air where c  299792.458 km/s is the speed of light and n  1.0003 is the refractive index of air.14 if pulses are emitted too frequently the returns from one pulse will be confused with the returns from previous pulses resulting in incorrect distance calculations determining heightedit assuming the earth is round the radar beam in vacuum would rise according to the reverse curvature of the earth however the atmosphere has a refractive index that diminishes with height due to its diminishing density this bends the radar beam slightly toward the ground and with a standard atmosphere this is equivalent to considering that the curvature of the beam is 4/3 the actual curvature of the earth depending on the elevation angle of the antenna and other considerations the following formula may be used to calculate the target's height above ground:15 where due to the earth's curvature and change of index of refraction with height the radar cannot see below the height above ground of the minimal angle shown in green or closer to the radar than the maximal one shown as a red cone in the center.16 calibrating intensity of returnedit because the targets are not unique in each volume the radar equation has to be developed beyond the basic one assuming a monostatic radar wheregtarorgrgdisplaystyle scriptstyle g_t=a_ror g_r=g:1217 in this case we have to add the cross sections of all the targets:18 in combining the two equations which leads to notice that the return now varies inversely tor2displaystyle r^2 instead ofr4displaystyle r^4 in order to compare the data coming from different distances from the radar one has to normalize them with this ratio data typesedit reflectivity in decibel or dbzedit reflectivity perceived by the radar ze varies by the sixth power of the rain droplets diameter d the square of the dielectric constant k of the targets and the drop size distribution e.g nd of marshall-palmer of the drops this gives a truncated gamma function 19 of the form precipitation rate r on the other hand is equal to the number of particles their volume and their fall speed vd as so ze and r have similar functions that can be resolved giving a relation between the two of the form how to read reflectivity on a radar displayedit radar returns are usually described by colour or level the colours in a radar image normally range from blue or green for weak returns to red or magenta for very strong returns the numbers in a verbal report increase with the severity of the returns for example the u.s national doppler radar sites use the following scale for different levels of reflectivity:20 strong returns red or magenta may indicate not only heavy rain but also thunderstorms hail strong winds or tornadoes but they need to be interpreted carefully for reasons described below when describing weather radar returns pilots dispatchers and air traffic controllers will typically refer to three return levels:21 aircraft will try to avoid level 2 returns when possible and will always avoid level 3 unless they are specially-designed research aircraft over the area covered by radar echoes a program assigns a precipitation type according to the surface temperature and dew point reported at the underlying weather stations precipitation types reported by human operated stations and certain automatic ones awos will have higher weight.23 then the program does interpolations to produce an image with defined zones these will include interpolation errors due to the calculation mesoscale variations of the precipitation zones will also be lost.22 more sophisticated programs use the numerical weather prediction output from models such as nam and wrf for the precipitation types and apply it as a first guess to the radar echoes then use the surface data for final output until dual-polarization section polarization below data are widely available any precipitation types on radar images are only indirect information and must be taken with care velocityedit precipitation is found in and below clouds light precipitation such as drops and flakes is subject to the air currents and scanning radar can pick up the horizontal component of this motion thus giving the possibility to estimate the wind speed and direction where precipitation is present pulse pairedit doppler weather radars use this phase difference pulse pair difference to calculate the precipitation's motion the intensity of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume where targets have slightly moved is:12 doppler dilemmaedit doppler interpretationedit in a uniform rainstorm moving eastward a radar beam pointing west will see the raindrops moving toward itself while a beam pointing east will see the drops moving away when the beam scans to the north or to the south no relative motion is noted.12 in the synoptic scale interpretation the user can extract the wind at different levels over the radar coverage region as the beam is scanning 360 degrees around the radar data will come from all those angles and be the radial projection of the actual wind on the individual angle the intensity pattern formed by this scan can be represented by a cosine curve maximum in the precipitation motion and zero in the perpendicular direction one can then calculate the direction and the strength of the motion of particles as long as there is enough coverage on the radar screen however the rain drops are falling as the radar only sees the radial component and has a certain elevation from ground the radial velocities are contaminated by some fraction of the falling speed this component is negligible in small elevation angles but must be taken into account for higher scanning angles.12 in the velocity data there could be smaller zones in the radar coverage where the wind varies from the one mentioned above for example a thunderstorm is a mesoscale phenomenon which often includes rotations and turbulence these may only cover few square kilometers but are visible by variations in the radial speed users can recognize velocity patterns in the wind associated with rotations such as mesocyclone convergence outflow boundary and divergence downburst polarizationedit droplets of falling liquid water tend to have a larger horizontal axis due to the drag coefficient of air while falling water droplets this causes the water molecule dipole to be oriented in that direction so radar beams are generally polarized horizontally in order to receive the maximal signal reflection if two pulses are sent simultaneously with orthogonal polarization vertical and horizontal zv and zh respectively two independent sets of data will be received these signals can be compared in several useful ways:2425 with more information about particle shape dual-polarization radars can more easily distinguish airborne debris from precipitation making it easier to locate tornados.26 with this new knowledge added to the reflectivity velocity and spectrum width produced by doppler weather radars researchers have been working on developing algorithms to differentiate precipitation types non-meteorological targets and to produce better rainfall accumulation estimates.242728 in the u.s. ncar and nssl have been world leaders in this field.2429 main types of radar outputsedit all data from radar scans are displayed according to the need of the users different outputs have been developed through time to reach this here is a list of common and specialized outputs available plan position indicatoredit since data are obtained one angle at a time the first way of displaying them has been the plan position indicator ppi which is only the layout of radar return on a two dimensional image one has to remember that the data coming from different distances to the radar are at different heights above ground ppis are afflicted with ground echoes near the radar as a supplemental problem these can be misinterpreted as real echoes so other products and further treatments of data have been developed to supplement such shortcomings usage reflectivity doppler and polarimetric data can use ppi in the case of doppler data two points of view are possible relative to the surface or the storm when looking at the general motion of the rain to extract wind at different altitudes it is better to use data relative to the radar but when looking for rotation or wind shear under a thunderstorm it is better to use the storm relative images that subtract the general motion of precipitation leaving the user to view the air motion as if he would be sitting on the cloud constant-altitude plan position indicatoredit to avoid some of the problems on ppis the constant-altitude plan position indicator cappi has been developed by canadian researchers it is basically a horizontal cross-section through radar data this way one can compare precipitation on an equal footing at difference distance from the radar and avoid ground echoes although data are taken at a certain height above ground a relation can be inferred between ground stations reports and the radar data since the cappi uses the closest angle to the desired height at each point from the radar the data can originate from slightly different altitudes as seen on the image in different points of the radar coverage it is therefore crucial to have a large enough number of sounding angles to minimize this height change furthermore the type of data must be changing relatively gradually with height to produce an image that is not noisy reflectivity data being relatively smooth with height cappis are mostly used for displaying them velocity data on the other hand can change rapidly in direction with height and cappis of them are not common it seems that only mcgill university is producing regularly doppler cappis with the 24 angles available on their radar.36 however some researchers have published papers using velocity cappis to study tropical cyclones and development of nexrad products.37 finally polarimetric data are recent and often noisy there doesn't seem to have regular use of cappi for them although the sigmet company offer a software capable to produce those types of images.38 vertical compositeedit another solution to the ppi problems is to produce images of the maximum reflectivity in a layer above ground this solution is usually taken when the number of angles available is small or variable the american national weather service is using such composite as their scanning scheme can vary from 4 to 14 angles according to their need which would make very coarse cappis the composite assures that no strong echo is missed in the layer and a treatment using doppler velocities eliminates the ground echoes comparing base and composite products one can locate virga and updrafts zones real time example nws burlington radar one can compare the base and composite products accumulationsedit another important use of radar data is the ability to assess the amount of precipitation that has fallen over large basins to be used in hydrological calculations such data is useful in flood control sewer management and dam construction the computed data from radar weather may be used in conjunction with data from ground stations to produce radar accumulations we have to estimate the rain rate over a point by the average value over that point between one ppi or cappi and the next then multiply by the time between those images if one wants for a longer period of time one has to add up all the accumulations from images during that time echotopsedit aviation is a heavy user of radar data one map particularly important in this field is the echotops for flight planning and avoidance of dangerous weather most country weather radars are scanning enough angles to have a 3d set of data over the area of coverage it is relatively easy to estimate the maximum altitude at which precipitation is found within the volume however those are not the tops of clouds as they always extend above the precipitation vertical cross sectionsedit to know the vertical structure of clouds in particular thunderstorms or the level of the melting layer a vertical cross-section product of the radar data is available this is done by displaying only the data along a line from coordinates a to b taken from the different angles scanned range height indicatoredit when a weather radar is scanning in only one direction vertically it obtains high resolution data along a vertical cut of the atmosphere the output of this sounding is called a range height indicator rhi which is excellent for viewing the detailed vertical structure of a storm this is different from the vertical cross section mentioned above by the fact that the radar is making a vertical cut along specific directions and does not scan over the entire 360 degrees around the site this kind of sounding and product is only available on research radars radar networksedit over the past few decades radar networks have been extended to allow the production of composite views covering large areas for instance many countries including the united states canada and much of europe produce images that include all of their radars this is not a trivial task in fact such a network can consist of different types of radar with different characteristics such as beam width wavelength and calibration these differences have to be taken into account when matching data across the network particularly to decide what data to use when two radars cover the same point if one uses the stronger echo but it comes from the more distant radar one uses returns that are from higher altitude coming from rain or snow that might evaporate before reaching the ground virga if one uses data from the closer radar it might be attenuated passing through a thunderstorm composite images of precipitations using a network of radars are made with all those limitations in mind automatic algorithmsedit to help meteorologists spot dangerous weather mathematical algorithms have been introduced in the weather radar treatment programs these are particularly important in analyzing the doppler velocity data as they are more complex the polarization data will even need more algorithms main algorithms for reflectivity:12 main algorithms for doppler velocities:12 animationsedit the animation of radar products can show the evolution of reflectivity and velocity patterns the user can extract information on the dynamics of the meteorological phenomena including the ability to extrapolate the motion and observe development or dissipation this can also reveal non-meteorological artifacts false echoes that will be discussed later radar integrated display with geospatial elementsedit a new popular presentation of weather radar data in united states is via radar integrated display with geospatial elements ridge in which the radar data is projected on a map with geospatial elements such as topography maps highways state/county boundaries and weather warnings the projection often is flexible giving the user a choice of various geographic elements it is frequently used in conjunction with animations of radar data over a time period.4041 limitations and artifactsedit radar data interpretation depends on many hypotheses about the atmosphere and the weather targets including:42 these assumptions are not always met one must be able to differentiate between reliable and dubious echoes anomalous propagation non-standard atmosphereedit the first assumption is that the radar beam is moving through air that cools down at a certain rate with height the position of the echoes depend heavily on this hypothesis however the real atmosphere can vary greatly from the norm super refractionedit temperature inversions often form near the ground for instance by air cooling at night while remaining warm aloft as the index of refraction of air decreases faster than normal the radar beam bends toward the ground instead of continuing upward eventually it will hit the ground and be reflected back toward the radar the processing program will then wrongly place the return echoes at the height and distance it would have been in normal conditions.42 this type of false return is relatively easy to spot on a time loop if it is due to night cooling or marine inversion as one sees very strong echoes developing over an area spreading in size laterally but not moving and varying greatly in intensity however inversion of temperature exists ahead of warm fronts and the abnormal propagation echoes are then mixed with real rain the extreme of this problem is when the inversion is very strong and shallow the radar beam reflects many times toward the ground as it has to follow a waveguide path this will create multiple bands of strong echoes on the radar images this situation can be found with inversions of temperature aloft or rapid decrease of moisture with height.43 in the former case it could be difficult to notice under refractionedit on the other hand if the air is unstable and cools faster than the standard atmosphere with height the beam ends up higher than expected.43 this indicates that precipitation is occurring higher than the actual height such an error is difficult to detect without additional temperature lapse-rate data for the area non-rayleigh targetsedit however for very large hydrometeors since the wavelength is on the order of stone the return levels off according to mie theory a return of more than 55 dbz is likely to come from hail but won't vary proportionally to the size on the other hand very small targets such as cloud droplets are too small to be excited and do not give a recordable return on common weather radars resolution and partially filled scanned volumeedit as demonstrated at the start of the article radar beams have a physical dimension and data are sampled at discrete angles not continuously along each angle of elevation.42 this results in an averaging of the values of the returns for reflectivity velocities and polarization data on the resolution volume scanned this shows how the output of weather radar is only an approximation of reality the image to the right compares real data from two radars almost colocated the tdwr has about half the beamwidth of the other and one can see twice more details than with the nexrad resolution can be improved by newer equipment but some things cannot as mentioned previously the volume scanned increases with distance so the possibility that the beam is only partially filled also increases this leads to underestimation of the precipitation rate at larger distances and fools the user into thinking that rain is lighter as it moves away beam geometryedit the radar beam has a distribution of energy similar to the diffraction pattern of a light passing through a slit.12 this is because the wave is transmitted to the parabolic antenna through a slit in the wave-guide at the focal point most of the energy is at the center of the beam and decreases along a curve close to a gaussian function on each side however there are secondary peaks of emission that will sample the targets at off-angles from the center designers attempt to minimize the power transmitted by such lobes but they cannot be completely eliminated when a secondary lobe hits a reflective target such as a mountain or a strong thunderstorm some of the energy is reflected to the radar this energy is relatively weak but arrives at the same time that the central peak is illuminating a different azimuth the echo is thus misplaced by the processing program this has the effect of actually broadening the real weather echo making a smearing of weaker values on each side of it this causes the user to overestimate the extent of the real echoes.42 non-weather targetsedit such extraneous objects have characteristics that allow a trained eye to distinguish them it is also possible to eliminate some of them with post-treatment of data using reflectivity doppler and polarization data wind farmsedit the rotating blades of windmills on modern wind farms can return the radar beam to the radar if they are in its path since the blades are moving the echoes will have a velocity and can be mistaken for real precipitation.47 the closer the wind farm the stronger the return and the combined signal from many towers is stronger in some conditions the radar can even see toward and away velocities that generate false positives for the tornado vortex signature algorithm on weather radar such an event occurred in 2009 in dodge city kansas.48 as with other structures that stand in the beam attenuation of radar returns from beyond windmills may also lead to underestimation attenuationedit shorter wavelengths are even more attenuated and are only useful on short range12 radar many television stations in the united states have 5cm radars to cover their audience area knowing their limitations and using them with the local nexrad can supplement the data available to a meteorologist due to the spread of dual-polarization radar systems robust and efficient approaches for the compesantion of rain attenuation are currently implemented by operational weather services.495051 bright bandedit a radar beam's reflectivity depends on the diameter of the target and its capacity to reflect snowflakes are large but weakly reflective while rain drops are small but highly reflective.12 when snow falls through a layer above freezing temperature it melts into rain using the reflectivity equation one can demonstrate that the returns from the snow before melting and the rain after are not too different as the change in dielectric constant compensates for the change in size however during the melting process the radar wave sees something akin to very large droplets as snow flakes become coated with water.12 this gives enhanced returns that can be mistaken for stronger precipitations on a ppi this will show up as an intense ring of precipitation at the altitude where the beam crosses the melting level while on a series of cappis only the ones near that level will have stronger echoes a good way to confirm a bright band is to make a vertical cross section through the data as illustrated in the picture above.42 an opposite problem is that drizzle precipitation with small water droplet diameter tends not to show up on radar because radar returns are proportional to the sixth power of droplet diameter multiple reflectionsedit it is assumed that the beam hits the weather targets and returns directly to the radar in fact there is energy reflected in all directions most of it is weak and multiple reflections diminish it even further so what can eventually return to the radar from such an event is negligible however some situations allow a multiple-reflected radar beam to be received by the radar antenna.12 for instance when the beam hits hail the energy spread toward the wet ground will be reflected back to the hail and then to the radar the resulting echo is weak but noticeable due to the extra path length it has to go through it arrives later at the antenna and is placed further than its source.52 this gives a kind of triangle of false weaker reflections placed radially behind the hail.42 solutions for now and the futureedit filteringedit these two images show what can be presently achieved to clean up radar data the output on the left is made with the raw returns and it is difficult to spot the real weather since rain and snow clouds are usually moving one can use the doppler velocities to eliminate a good part of the clutter ground echoes reflections from buildings seen as urban spikes anomalous propagation the image on the right has been filtered using this property however not all non-meteorological targets remain still birds insects dust others like the bright band depend on the structure of the precipitation polarization offers a direct typing of the echoes which could be used to filter more false data or produce separate images for specialized purposes this recent development is expected to improve the quality of radar products mesonetedit scanning strategiesedit the number of elevation scanned and the time taken for a complete cycle depend on the weather situation for instance with little or no precipitation the scheme may be limited the lowest angles and using longer impulses in order to detect wind shift near the surface on the other hand in violent thundertorm situations it is better to scan on a large number of angles in order to have a 3 dimensions view of the precipitations as often as possible to mitigate those different demands scanning strategies have been developed according to the type of radar the wavelength used and the most commons weather situations in the area considered one example of scanning strategies is given by the us nexrad radar network which has evolved with time for instance in 2008 it added extra resolution of data55 and in 2014 additional intra-cycle scanning of lowest level elevation meso-sails56 electronic soundingedit timeliness is also a point needing improvement with 5 to 10 minutes time between complete scans of weather radar much data is lost as a thunderstorm develops a phased-array radar is being tested at the national severe storms lab in norman oklahoma to speed the data gathering.57 a team in japan has deployed a phased-array radar for 3d nowcasting at the riken advanced institute for computational science aics.58 specialized applicationsedit avionics weather radaredit aircraft application of radar systems include weather radar collision avoidance target tracking ground proximity and other systems for commercial weather radar arinc 708 is the primary specification for weather radar systems using an airborne pulse-doppler radar antennasedit unlike ground weather radar which is set at a fixed angle airborne weather radar is being utilized from the nose or wing of an aircraft not only will the aircraft be moving up down left and right but it will be rolling as well to compensate for this the antenna is linked and calibrated to the vertical gyro located on the aircraft by doing this the pilot is able to set a pitch or angle to the antenna that will enable the stabilizer to keep the antenna pointed in the right direction under moderate maneuvers the small servo motors will not be able to keep up with abrupt maneuvers but it will try in doing this the pilot is able to adjust the radar so that it will point towards the weather system of interest if the airplane is at a low altitude the pilot would want to set the radar above the horizon line so that ground clutter is minimized on the display if the airplane is at a very high altitude the pilot will set the radar at a low or negative angle to point the radar towards the clouds wherever they may be relative to the aircraft if the airplane changes attitude the stabilizer will adjust itself accordingly so that the pilot doesn't have to fly with one hand and adjust the radar with the other.59 receivers/transmittersedit thunderstorm trackingedit digital radar systems now have capabilities far beyond that of their predecessors digital systems now offer thunderstorm tracking surveillance this provides users with the ability to acquire detailed information of each storm cloud being tracked thunderstorms are first identified by matching precipitation raw data received from the radar pulse to some sort of template preprogrammed into the system in order for a thunderstorm to be identified it has to meet strict definitions of intensity and shape that set it apart from any non-convective cloud usually it must show signs of organization in the horizontal and continuity in the vertical a core or a more intense center to be identified and tracked by digital radar trackers.2261 once the thunderstorm cell is identified speed distance covered direction and estimated time of arrival eta are all tracked and recorded to be utilized later doppler radar and bird migrationedit using the doppler weather radar is not limited to determine the location and velocity of precipitation but it can track bird migrations as well as seen in the non-weather targets section the radio waves sent out by the radars bounce off rain and birds alike or even insects like butterflies.6263 the us national weather service for instance have reported having the flights of birds appear on their radars as clouds and then fade away when the birds land.6465 the u.s national weather service st louis has even reported monarch butterflies appearing on their radars.66 different programs in north america use regular weather radars and specialized radar data to determine the paths height of flight and timing of migrations.6768 this is useful information in planning for windmill farms placement and operation to reduce bird fatalities aviation safety and other wildlife management in europe there has been similar developments and even a comprehensive forecast program for aviation safety based on radar detection 9 69 meteorite fall detectionedit according to the american meteor society meteorite falls occur on a daily basis somewhere on earth.70 however the database of worldwide meteorite falls maintained by the meteoritical society typically records only about 10-15 new meteorite falls annually71 it is in dark flight that falling meteorites typically fall through the interaction volumes of most types of radars it as been demonstrated that it is possible to identify falling meteorites in weather radar imagery by different studies.727374757677 this is especially useful for meteorite recovery as weather radar are part of widespread networks and scan the atmosphere continuously furthermore the meteorites are cause a perturbance of local winds by turbulence which is noticeable on doppler outputs and are falling nearly vertically so their resting place on the ground is close to their radar signature an example is shown in the image on the right showing the park forest il meteorite fall which occurred on 26 march 2003 the red/green feature at upper left is the motion of clouds near the radar itself and a signature of falling meteorites is seen inside the yellow ellipse at image center the intermixed red and green pixels indicate turbulence in this case arising from the wakes of falling high-velocity meteorites see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views

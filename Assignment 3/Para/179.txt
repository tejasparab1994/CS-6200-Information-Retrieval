work physics w  f  s in physics a force is said to do work if when acting there is a displacement of the point of application in the direction of the force for example when a ball is held above the ground and then dropped the work done on the ball as it falls is equal to the weight of the ball a force multiplied by the distance to the ground a displacement work transfers energy from one place to another or one form to another the term work was introduced in 1826 by the french mathematician gaspard-gustave coriolis12 as weight lifted through a height which is based on the use of early steam engines to lift buckets of water out of flooded ore mines the si unit of work is the joule j  contents  unitsedit the si unit of work is the joule j which is defined as the work expended by a force of one newton through a displacement of one metre non-si units of work include the erg the foot-pound the foot-poundal the kilowatt hour the litre-atmosphere and the horsepower-hour due to work having the same physical dimension as heat occasionally measurement units typically reserved for heat or energy content such as therm btu and calorie are utilized as a measuring unit work and energyedit the workwdisplaystyle w done by a constant force of magnitudefdisplaystyle f on a point that moves a displacementsdisplaystyle s in a straight line in the direction of the force is the product work is closely related to energy the work-energy principle states that an increase in the kinetic energy of a rigid body is caused by an equal amount of positive work done on the body by the resultant force acting on that body conversely a decrease in kinetic energy is caused by an equal amount of negative work done by the resultant force from newton's second law it can be shown that work on a free no fields rigid no internal degrees of freedom body is equal to the change in kinetic energykedisplaystyle ke of the velocity and rotation of that body the work of forces generated by a potential function is known as potential energy and the forces are said to be conservative therefore work on an object that is merely displaced in a conservative force field without change in velocity or rotation is equal to minus the change of potential energypedisplaystyle pe of the object these formulas show that work is the energy associated with the action of a force so work subsequently possesses the physical dimensions and units of energy the work/energy principles discussed here are identical to electric work/energy principles constraint forcesedit constraint forces determine the movement of components in a system constraining the object within a boundary in the case of a slope plus gravity the object is stuck to the slope when attached to a taut string it cannot move in an outwards direction to make the string any 'tauter' constraint forces ensure the velocity in the direction of the constraint is zero which means the constraint forces do not perform work on the system if the system doesn't change in time4 they eliminate all movement in the direction of the constraint thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force due to this force this only applies for a single particle system for example in an atwood machine the rope does work on each body but keeping always the net virtual work null there are however cases where this is not true.4 for example the centripetal force exerted inwards by a string on a ball in uniform circular motion sideways constrains the ball to circular motion restricting its movement away from the center of the circle this force does zero work because it is perpendicular to the velocity of the ball another example is a book on a table if external forces are applied to the book so that it slides on the table then the force exerted by the table constrains the book from moving downwards the force exerted by the table supports the book and is perpendicular to its movement which means that this constraint force does not perform work the magnetic force on a charged particle is f  qv  b where q is the charge v is the velocity of the particle and b is the magnetic field the result of a cross product is always perpendicular to both of the original vectors so f  v the dot product of two perpendicular vectors is always zero so the work w  f  v  0 and the magnetic force does not do work it can change the direction of motion but never change the speed mathematical calculationedit for moving objects the quantity of work/time power is calculated thus at any instant the rate of the work done by a force measured in joules/second or watts is the scalar product of the force a vector and the velocity vector of the point of application this scalar product of force and velocity is classified as instantaneous power just as velocities may be integrated over time to obtain a total distance by the fundamental theorem of calculus the total work along a path is similarly the time-integral of instantaneous power applied along the trajectory of the point of application.5 where the f  v is the power over the instant dt the sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the point yields the work where c is the trajectory from xt1 to xt2 this integral is computed along the trajectory of the particle and is therefore said to be path dependent if the force is always directed along this line and the magnitude of the force is f then this integral simplifies to where s is displacement along the line if f is constant in addition to being directed along the line then the integral simplifies further to where s is the displacement of the point along the line in the notable case of a force applied to a body always at an angle of 90 from the velocity vector as when a body moves in a circle under a central force no work is done at all since the cosine of 90 degrees is zero thus no work can be performed by gravity on a planet with a circular orbit this is ideal as all orbits are slightly elliptical also no work is done on a body moving circularly at a constant speed while constrained by mechanical force such as moving at constant speed in a frictionless ideal centrifuge work done by a variable forceedit wabfsdsdisplaystyle w=int limits _a^bmathbf fs cdot dmathbf s  torque and rotationedit a force couple results from equal and opposite forces acting on two different points of a rigid body the sum resultant of these forces may cancel but their effect on the body is the couple or torque t the work of the torque is calculated as if the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction then it takes the form if the torque t is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that and both the torque and angular velocity are constant then the work takes the form6 as presented above notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work work and potential energyedit the scalar product of a force f and the velocity v of its point of application defines the power input to a system at an instant of time integration of this power over the trajectory of the point of application c  xt defines the work input to the system by the force path dependenceedit therefore the work done by a force f on an object that travels along a curve c is given by the line integral where dxt defines the trajectory c and v is the velocity along this trajectory in general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent the time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power path independenceedit if the work for an applied force is independent of the path then the work done by the force is by the gradient theorem the potential function evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application such a force is said to be conservative this means that there is a potential function ux that can be evaluated at the two points xt1 and xt2 to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points it is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential that is the function ux is called the potential energy associated with the applied force examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces in this case the gradient of work yields and the force f is said to be derivable from a potential.7 because the potential u defines a force f at every point x in space the set of forces is called a force field the power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work or potential in the direction of the velocity v of the body that is work by gravityedit if an object is displaced upwards or downwards a vertical distance y2  y1 the work w done on the object by its weight mg is work by gravity in spaceedit the force of gravity exerted by a mass m on another mass m is given by where r is the position vector from m to m let the mass m move at the velocity v then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position rt1 to rt2 is given by notice that the position and velocity of the mass m are given by where er and et are the radial and tangential unit vectors directed relative to the vector from m to m use this to simplify the formula for work of gravity to this calculation uses the fact that the function is the gravitational potential function also known as gravitational potential energy the negative sign follows the convention that work is gained from a loss of potential energy work by a springedit for convenience consider contact with the spring occurs at t  0 then the integral of the product of the distance x and the x-velocity xvx is 1/2x2 work by a gasedit where p is pressure v is volume and a and b are initial and final volumes wherev1displaystyle v_1 andv2displaystyle v_2 are the speeds of the particle before and after the work is done and m is its mass derivation for a particle moving along a straight lineedit in the case the resultant force f is constant in both magnitude and direction and parallel to the velocity of the particle the particle is moving with constant acceleration a along a straight line.11 the relation between the net force and the acceleration is given by the equation f  ma newton's second law and the particle displacement s can be expressed by the equation which follows fromv22v122asdisplaystyle v_2^2=v_1^2+2as see equations of motion the work of the net force is calculated as the product of its magnitude and the particle displacement substituting the above equations one obtains other derivation vertical displacement derivation w  f  s  mg  h in the general case of rectilinear motion when the net force f is not constant in magnitude but is constant in direction and parallel to the velocity of the particle the work must be integrated along the path of the particle the identityav12dv2dtdisplaystyle textstyle mathbf a cdot mathbf v =frac 12frac dv^2dt requires some algebra from the identityv2vvdisplaystyle textstyle v^2=mathbf v cdot mathbf v  and definitionadvdtdisplaystyle textstyle mathbf a =frac dmathbf v dt it follows the remaining part of the above derivation is just simple calculus same as in the preceding rectilinear case derivation for a particle in constrained movementedit to see this consider a particle p that follows the trajectory xt with a force f acting on it isolate the particle from its environment to expose constraint forces r then newton's law takes the form where m is the mass of the particle vector formulationedit note that n dots above a vector indicates its nth time derivative the scalar product of each side of newton's law with the velocity vector yields because the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point xt1 to the point xt2 to obtain the left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time t1 to time t2 this can also be written as this integral is computed along the trajectory xt of the particle and is therefore path dependent the right side of the first integral of newton's equations can be simplified using the following identity see product rule for derivation now it is integrated explicitly to obtain the change in kinetic energy where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity tangential and normal componentsedit it is useful to resolve the velocity and acceleration vectors into tangential and normal components along the trajectory xt such that where then the scalar product of velocity with acceleration in newton's second law takes the form where the kinetic energy of the particle is defined by the scalar quantity this derivation can be generalized to arbitrary rigid body systems moving in a straight line skid to a stopedit consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to f the constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define r and we have for convenience let the trajectory be along the x-axis so x  d 0 and the velocity is v  v 0 then r  v  0 and f  v  fxv where fx is the component of f along the x-axis so integration of both sides yields if fx is constant along the trajectory then the integral of velocity is distance so notice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is m  w/g coasting down a mountain road gravity racingedit let the trajectory of the vehicle following the road be xt which is a curve in three-dimensional space the force acting on the vehicle that pushes it down the road is the constant force of gravity f  0 0 w while the force of the road on the vehicle is the constraint force r newton's second law yields the scalar product of this equation with the velocity v  vx vy vz yields where v is the magnitude of v the constraint forces between the vehicle and the road cancel from this equation because r  v  0 which means they do no work integrate both sides to obtain the weight force w is constant along the trajectory and the integral of the vertical velocity is the vertical distance therefore recall that vt1=0 notice that this result does not depend on the shape of the road followed by the vehicle this formula uses the fact that the weight of the vehicle is w  mg work of forces acting on a rigid bodyedit the work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated from the work of a resultant force and torque to see this let the forces f1 f2 .. fn act on the points x1 x2 .. xn in a rigid body the trajectories of xi i  1 ... n are defined by the movement of the rigid body this movement is given by the set of rotations at and the trajectory dt of a reference point in the body let the coordinates xi i  1 ... n define these points in the moving rigid body's reference frame m so that the trajectories traced in the fixed frame f are given by the velocity of the points xi along their trajectories are known as the angular velocity matrix or this formula can be rewritten to obtain where f and t are the resultant force and torque applied at the reference point d of the moving frame m in the rigid body referencesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more

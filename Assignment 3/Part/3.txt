hurricane isabel in north carolina the storm surge from isabel washed out a portion of hatteras island to form what was unofficially known as isabel inlet damage was greatest along the outer banks where thousands of homes were damaged or even destroyed the worst of the effects of isabel occurred in virginia especially in the hampton roads area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as richmond and washington dc virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane about 64 of the damage and 68 of the deaths occurred in north carolina and virginia electric service was disrupted in areas of virginia for several days some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damage  contents  meteorological historyedit preparationsedit a contingency plan was established at the tomb of the unknowns at arlington national cemetery that should the winds exceed 120mph the guards could take positions in the trophy room above the tomb plaza and providing continual sight of the tomb but the plan was never implemented however it spawned an urban legend that the third infantry sent orders to seek shelter orders that were deliberately disobeyed.23 impactedit caribbean and southeast united statesedit north carolinaedit virginiaedit mid-atlanticedit northeast united statesedit elsewhereedit aftermathedit in north carolina hundreds of residents were stranded in hatteras following the formation of isabel inlet.74 people who were not residents were not allowed to be on the outer banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions when visitors were allowed to return many ventured to see the new inlet despite a 1-mile 1.6-km walk from the nearest road.37 initially long term solutions to the isabel inlet such as building a bridge or a ferry system were considered though they were ultimately canceled in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet coastal geologists were opposed to the solution stating the evolution of the outer banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes.75 dredging operations began on october 17 about a month after the hurricane struck the united states geological survey used sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of hatteras island a choice made to minimize the impact to submerged aquatic vegetation and due to the channel being filled somewhat during the hurricane.76 on november 22 about two months after the hurricane struck north carolina highway 12 and hatteras island were reopened to public access on the same day the ferry between hatteras and ocracoke was reopened.37 retirementedit because of widespread property damage and extensive death tolls the name isabel was retired after the 2003 season and will not be used for future atlantic hurricanes it was replaced by ida for the naming list for the 2009 season.80 the names ina and ivy were also suggested as possible replacement names.81 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

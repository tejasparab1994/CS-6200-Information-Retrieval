monsoon the major monsoon systems of the world consist of the west african and asia-australian monsoons the inclusion of the north and south american monsoons with incomplete wind reversal has been debated.6 the term was first used in english in british india now india bangladesh and pakistan and neighbouring countries to refer to the big seasonal winds blowing from the bay of bengal and arabian sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area.78  contents  etymology history strength of impact the impact of monsoon on the local weather is different from place to place in some places there is just a likelihood of having a little more or less rain in other places quasi semi-deserts are turned into vivid green grasslands where all sorts of plants and crops can flourish the indian monsoon turns large parts of india from a kind of semi-desert into green lands see photos only taken 3 months apart in the western ghats in places like this it is crucial for farmers to have the right timing for putting the seeds on the fields as it is essential to use all the rain that is available for growing crops process during warmer months sunlight heats the surfaces of both land and oceans but land temperatures rise more quickly as the land's surface becomes warmer the air above it expands and an area of low pressure develops meanwhile the ocean remains at a lower temperature than the land and the air above it retains a higher pressure this difference in pressure causes sea breezes to blow from the ocean to the land bringing moist air inland this moist air rises to a higher altitude over land and then it flows back toward the ocean thus completing the cycle however when the air rises and while it is still over the land the air cools this decreases the air's ability to hold water and this causes precipitation over the land this is why summer monsoons cause so much rain over land in the colder months the cycle is reversed then the land cools faster than the oceans and the air over the land has higher pressure than air over the ocean this causes the air over the land to flow to the ocean when humid air rises over the ocean it cools and this causes precipitation over the oceans the cool air then flows towards the land to complete the cycle. most summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air the intensity and duration however are not uniform from year to year winter monsoons by contrast have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge subside and cause drought.19 similar rainfall is caused when moist ocean air is lifted upwards by mountains20 surface heating21 convergence at the surface22 divergence aloft or from storm-produced outflows at the surface.23 however the lifting occurs the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure and this produces condensation global monsoon summary table africa west african and southeast african the monsoon of western sub-saharan africa is the result of the seasonal shifts of the intertropical convergence zone and the great seasonal temperature and humidity differences between the sahara and the equatorial atlantic ocean.30 it migrates northward from the equatorial atlantic in february reaches western africa on or near june 22 then moves back to the south by october.31 the dry northeasterly trade winds and their more extreme form the harmattan are interrupted by the northern shift in the itcz and resultant southerly rain-bearing winds during the summer the semiarid sahel and sudan depend upon this pattern for most of their precipitation north america the north american monsoon nam occurs from late june or early july into september originating over mexico and spreading into the southwest united states by mid-july it affects mexico along the sierra madre occidental as well as arizona new mexico nevada utah colorado west texas and california it pushes as far west as the peninsular ranges and transverse ranges of southern california but rarely reaches the coastal strip a wall of desert thunderstorms only a half-hour's drive away is a common summer sight from the sunny skies along the coast during the monsoon the north american monsoon is known to many as the summer southwest mexican or arizona monsoon.3233 it is also sometimes called the desert monsoon as a large part of the affected area are the mojave and sonoran deserts however it is debatable whether the north and south american weather patterns with incomplete wind reversal should be counted as true monsoons.6 asia the asian monsoons may be classified into a few sub-systems such as the indian subcontinental monsoon which affects the indian subcontinent and surrounding regions including nepal and the east asian monsoon which affects southern china taiwan korea and parts of japan south asian monsoon the southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin around the beginning of june and fade away by the end of september the moisture-laden winds on reaching the southernmost point of the indian peninsula due to its topography become divided into two parts the arabian sea branch and the bay of bengal branch the arabian sea branch of the southwest monsoon first hits the western ghats of the coastal state of kerala india thus making this area the first state in india to receive rain from the southwest monsoon this branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the western ghats konkan and goa with precipitation on coastal areas west of the western ghats the eastern areas of the western ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the western ghats the monsoon accounts for 80 of the rainfall in india.citation needed indian agriculture which accounts for 25 of the gdp and employs 70 of the population is heavily dependent on the rains for growing crops especially like cotton rice oilseeds and coarse grains a delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy as evidenced in the numerous droughts in india in the 1990s the monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city-dwellers as well for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in june.34 however the roads take a battering every year often houses and streets are waterlogged and slums are flooded despite drainage systems a lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economic loss including damage to property and loss of lives as evidenced in the 2005 flooding in mumbai that brought the city to a standstill bangladesh and certain regions of india like assam and west bengal also frequently experience heavy floods during this season recently areas in india that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year like the thar desert have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season the influence of the southwest monsoon is felt as far north as in china's xinjiang it is estimated that about 70 of all precipitation in the central part of the tian shan mountains falls during the three summer months when the region is under the monsoon influence about 70 of that is directly of cyclonic i.e. monsoon-driven origin as opposed to local convection.35 around september with the sun fast retreating south the northern land mass of the indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly with this air pressure begins to build over northern india the indian ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still holds its heat this causes cold wind to sweep down from the himalayas and indo-gangetic plain towards the vast spans of the indian ocean south of the deccan peninsula this is known as the northeast monsoon or retreating monsoon while travelling towards the indian ocean the dry cold wind picks up some moisture from the bay of bengal and pours it over peninsular india and parts of sri lanka cities like chennai which get less rain from the southwest monsoon receive rain from this monsoon about 50 to 60 of the rain received by the state of tamil nadu is from the northeast monsoon.36 in southern asia the northeastern monsoons take place from december to early march when the surface high-pressure system is strongest.37 the jet stream in this region splits into the southern subtropical jet and the polar jet the subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern asia creating dry air streams which produce clear skies over india meanwhile a low pressure system develops over south-east asia and australasia and winds are directed toward australia known as a monsoon trough east asian monsoon the east asian monsoon affects large parts of indo-china philippines china taiwan korea and japan it is characterised by a warm rainy summer monsoon and a cold dry winter monsoon the rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches east-west except in east china where it is tilted east-northeast over korea and japan the seasonal rain is known as meiyu in china jangma in korea and bai-u in japan with the latter two resembling frontal rain the onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over south china and taiwan in early may from may through august the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward beginning over indochina and the south china sea may to the yangtze river basin and japan june and finally to north china and korea july when the monsoon ends in august the rain belt moves back to south china australia also known as the indo-australian monsoon the rainy season occurs from september to february and it is a major source of energy for the hadley circulation during boreal winter the maritime continent monsoon and the australian monsoon may be considered to be the same system the indo-australian monsoon it is associated with the development of the siberian high and the movement of the heating maxima from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere north-easterly winds flow down southeast asia are turned north-westerly/westerly by borneo topography towards australia this forms a cyclonic circulation vortex over borneo which together with descending cold surges of winter air from higher latitudes cause significant weather phenomena in the region examples are the formation of a rare low-latitude tropical storm in 2001 tropical storm vamei and the devastating flood of jakarta in 2007 the onset of the monsoon over the maritime continent tends to follow the heating maxima down vietnam and the malay peninsula september to sumatra borneo and the philippines october to java sulawesi november irian jaya and northern australia december january however the monsoon is not a simple response to heating but a more complex interaction of topography wind and sea as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the region the australian monsoon the wet occurs in the southern summer when the monsoon trough develops over northern australia over three-quarters of annual rainfall in northern australia falls during this time europe the european monsoon more commonly known as the return of the westerlies is the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the atlantic where they become loaded with wind and rain.38 these westerly winds are a common phenomenon during the european winter but they ease as spring approaches in late march and through april and may the winds pick up again in june which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as the return of the westerlies.39 the rain usually arrives in two waves at the beginning of june and again in mid to late june the european monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional sense in that it doesn't meet all the requirements to be classified as such instead the return of the westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that delivers a series of low pressure centres to western europe where they create unsettled weather these storms generally feature significantly lower than average temperatures fierce rain or hail thunder and strong winds.40 the return of the westerlies affects europe's northern atlantic coastline more precisely ireland great britain the benelux countries western germany northern france and parts of scandinavia see also references further

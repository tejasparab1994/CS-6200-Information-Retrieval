firestorm a firestorm is a conflagration which attains such intensity that it creates and sustains its own wind system it is most commonly a natural phenomenon created during some of the largest bushfires and wildfires although the word has been used to describe certain large fires1 the phenomenon's determining characteristic is a fire with its own storm-force winds from every point of the compass.23 the black saturday bushfires and the great peshtigo fire are possible examples of forest fires with some portion of combustion due to a firestorm as is the great hinckley fire firestorms have also occurred in cities usually as a deliberate effect of targeted explosives such as occurred as a result of the aerial firebombings of hamburg dresden and the atomic bombing of hiroshima  contents  mechanismedit a firestorm is created as a result of the stack effect as the heat of the original fire draws in more and more of the surrounding air this draft can be quickly increased if a low-level jet stream exists over or near the fire as the updraft mushrooms strong inwardly-directed gusty winds develop around the fire supplying it with additional air this would seem to prevent the firestorm from spreading on the wind but the tremendous turbulence created may also cause the strong surface inflow winds to change direction erratically firestorms resulting from the bombardment of urban areas in the second world war were generally confined to the areas initially seeded with incendiary devices and the firestorm did not appreciably spread outward.4 a firestorm may also develop into a mesocyclone and induce true tornadoes/fire whirls this occurred with the 2002 durango fire5 and probably with the much greater peshtigo fire.67 the greater draft of a firestorm draws in greater quantities of oxygen which significantly increases combustion thereby also substantially increasing the production of heat the intense heat of a firestorm manifests largely as radiated heat infrared radiation which may ignite flammable material at a distance ahead of the fire itself.89not in citation given this also serves to expand the area and the intensity of the firestorm.not in citation given violent erratic wind drafts suck movables into the fire and as is observed with all intense conflagrations radiated heat from the fire can melt asphalt some metals and glass and turn street tarmac into flammable hot liquid the very high temperatures ignite anything that might possibly burn until the firestorm runs low on fuel according to expertswho? a firestorm does not appreciably ignite material at a distance ahead of itself more accurately the heat desiccates those materials and makes them more vulnerable to ignition by embers or firebrands increasing the rate of fire spotting during the formation of a firestorm many fires merge to form a single convective column of hot gases rising from the burning area and strong fire-induced radial inwardly directed winds are associated with the convective column thus the fire front is essentially stationary and the outward spread of fire is prevented by the in-rushing wind.10 a firestorm is characterized by strong to gale-force winds blowing toward the fire everywhere around the fire perimeter an effect which is caused by the buoyancy of the rising column of hot gases over the intense mass fire drawing in cool air from the periphery these winds from the perimeter blow the fire brands into the burning area and tend to cool the unignited fuel outside the fire area so that ignition of material outside the periphery by radiated heat and fire embers is more difficult thus limiting fire spread.4 at hiroshima this inrushing to feed the fire is said to have prevented the firestorm perimeter from expanding and thus the firestorm was confined to the area of the city damaged by the blast.11 large wildfire conflagrations are distinct from firestorms if they have moving fire fronts which are driven by the ambient wind and do not develop their own wind system like true firestorms this does not mean that a firestorm must be stationary as with any other convective storm the circulation may follow surrounding pressure gradients and winds if those lead it onto fresh fuel sources. furthermore non-firestorm conflagrations can develop from a single ignition whereas firestorms have only been observed where large numbers of fires are burning simultaneously over a relatively large area13 with the important caveat that the density of simultaneously burning fires needs to be above a critical threshold for a firestorm to form a notable example of large numbers of fires burning simultaneously over a large area without a firestorm developing was the kuwaiti oil fires of 1991 where the distance between individual fires was too large the high temperatures within the firestorm zone ignite most everything that might possibly burn until a tipping point is reached that is upon running low on fuel which occurs after the firestorm has consumed so much of the available fuel within the firestorm zone that the necessary fuel density required to keep the firestorm's wind system active drops below the threshold level at which time the firestorm breaks up into isolated conflagrations weather and climate effectsedit on a more continental and global extent away from the direct vicinity of the fire wildfire firestorms which produce pyrocumulonimbus cloud events have been found to surprisingly frequently generate minor nuclear winter effects.16171819 these are analogous to minor volcanic winters with each mass addition of volcanic gases additive in increasing the depth of the winter cooling from near-imperceptible to year without a summer levels city firestormsedit the same underlying combustion physics can also apply to man-made structures such as cities during war or natural disaster firebombingedit firebombing is a technique designed to damage a target generally an urban area through the use of fire caused by incendiary devices rather than from the blast effect of large bombs such raids often employ both incendiary devices and high explosives the high explosive destroys roofs making it easier for the incendiary devices to penetrate the structures and cause fires the high explosives also disrupt the ability of firefighters to douse the fires.21 the germans again and again missed their chance ...of setting our cities ablaze by a concentrated attack coventry was adequately concentrated in point of space but all the same there was little concentration in point of time and nothing like the fire tornadoes of hamburg or dresden ever occurred in this country but they did do us enough damage to teach us the principle of concentration the principle of starting so many fires at the same time that no fire fighting services however efficiently and quickly they were reinforced by the fire brigades of other towns could get them under control. based on world war ii experience with mass fires resulting from air raids on germany and japan the minimum requirements for a firestorm to develop are considered by some authorities to be the following 1 at least 8 pounds of combustibles per square foot of fire area 40 kg per square meter 2 at least half of the structures in the area on fire simultaneously 3 a wind of less than 8 miles per hour at the time and 4 a minimum burning area of about half a square mile 21st century cities in comparison to world war ii citiesedit similarly one reason for the lack of success in creating a true firestorm in the bombing of berlin in world war ii was that the building density or builtupness factor in berlin was too low to support easy fire spread from building to building another reason was that much of the building construction was newer and better than in most of the old german city centers modern building practices in the berlin of world war ii led to more effective firewalls and fire-resistant construction mass firestorms never proved to be possible in berlin no matter how heavy the raid or what kinds of firebombs were dropped no true firestorm ever developed.48 nuclear weapons in comparison to conventional weaponsedit the incendiary effects of a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features in principle the same overall result with respect to destruction of life and property can be achieved by the use of conventional incendiary and high-explosive bombs.49 it has been estimated for example that the same fire ferocity and damage produced at hiroshima by one 16-kiloton nuclear bomb from a single b-29 could have instead been produced by about 1200 tons/1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 b-29s distributed over the city.495051 hiroshima after the bombing and firestorm no known aerial photography of the firestorm exists hiroshima aftermath despite a true firestorm developing reinforced concrete buildings as in tokyo similarly remained standing signed by the enola gay pilot paul w tibbets this tokyo residential section was virtually destroyed all that remained standing were concrete buildings in this photograph american historian gabriel kolko also echoed this sentiment this break from the linear expectation of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors first the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal for the creation of fires in an incendiary bombing raid incendiary weapons followed after high-explosive blast weapons were dropped in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a limited quantity of explosive and incendiary weapons the so-called two-ton cookies28 also known as blockbusters were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains as well as to blow off roofs doors and windows creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped ideally into holes created by the prior blast weapons such into attic and roof spaces.596061 on the other hand nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order with thermal effects and flash occurring first which are then followed by the slower blast wave it is for this reason that conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield it is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts franklin d'olier samuel glasstone and philip j dolan to state that the same fire damage suffered at hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton/1000 tons of incendiary bombs.4950 the second factor explaining the non-intuitive break in the expected results of greater explosive yield producing greater city fire damage is that city fire damage is largely dependent not on the yield of the weapons used but on the conditions in and around the city itself with the fuel loading per square meter value of the city being one of the major factors a few hundred strategically placed incendiary devices would be sufficient to start a firestorm in a city if the conditions for a firestorm namely high fuel loading are already inherent to the city see bat bomb the great fire of london in 1666 although not forming a firestorm due to the single point of ignition serves as an example that given a densely packed and predominately wooden and thatch building construction in the urban area a mass fire is conceivable from the mere incendiary power of no more than a domestic fireplace on the other hand the largest nuclear weapon conceivable will be incapable of igniting a city into a firestorm if the city's properties namely its fuel density are not conducive to one developing despite the disadvantage of nuclear weapons when compared to conventional weapons of lower or comparable yield in terms of effectiveness at starting fires for the reasons discussed above nuclear weapons also do not add any fuel to a city and fires are entirely dependent on what was contained in the city prior to bombing in direct contrast to the incendiary device effect of conventional raids one undeniable advantage of nuclear weapons over conventional weapons when it comes to creating fires is that nuclear weapons undoubtedly produce all their thermal and explosive effects in a very short period of time that is to use arthur harris's terminology they are the epitome of an air raid guaranteed to be concentrated in point in time in contrast early in world war ii the ability to achieve conventional air raids concentrated in point of time depended largely upon the skill of pilots to remain in formation and their ability to hit the target whilst at times also being under heavy fire from anti-aircraft fire from the air defensives of the cities below nuclear weapons largely remove these uncertain variables therefore nuclear weapons reduce the question of whether a city will firestorm or not to a smaller number of variables to the point of becoming entirely reliant on the intrinsic properties of the city such as fuel loading and predictable atmospheric conditions such as wind speed in and around the city and less reliant on the unpredictable possibility of hundreds of bomber crews acting together successfully as a single unit see alsoedit potential firestormsedit portions of the following fires are often described as firestorms but no reliable references as of yet corroborate this referencesedit further

storm a storm is any disturbed state of an environment or astronomical body's atmosphere especially affecting its surface and strongly implying severe weather it may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind tornados hail thunder and lightning a thunderstorm heavy precipitation snowstorm rainstorm heavy freezing rain ice storm strong winds tropical cyclone windstorm or wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere as in a dust storm blizzard sandstorm etc storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility lightning wildfires and vertical wind shear however systems with significant rainfall and duration help alleviate drought in places they move through heavy snowfall can allow special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise such as skiing and snowmobiling the english word comes from proto-germanic *sturmaz meaning noise tumult.2  contents  formationedit storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with a system of high pressure surrounding it this combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of storm clouds such as the cumulonimbus small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds typesedit there are many varieties and names for storms classificationedit extraterrestrial stormsedit storms do not only occur on earth other planetary bodies with a sufficient atmosphere gas giants in particular also undergo stormy weather the great red spot on jupiter provides a well-known example though technically an anticyclone with greater than hurricane wind speeds it is larger than the earth and has persisted for at least 340 years having first been observed by astronomer galileo galilei neptune also had its own lesser-known great dark spot in september 1994 the hubble telescope  using wide field planetary camera 2  imaged storms on saturn generated by upwelling of warmer air similar to a terrestrial thunderhead the east-west extent of the same-yearclarification needed storm equalled the diameter of earth the storm was observed earlier in september 1990 and acquired the name dragon storm the dust storms of mars vary in size but can often cover the entire planet they tend to occur when mars comes closest to the sun and have been shown to increase the global temperature.11 one particularly large martian storm was exhaustively studied up close due to coincidental timing when the first spacecraft to successfully orbit another planet mariner 9 arrived and successfully orbited mars on 14 november 1971 planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with a planet-wide robe of dust the largest storm ever observed on mars the surface of the planet was totally obscured mariner 9's computer was reprogrammed from earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled however the surface-obscured images contributed much to the collection of mars atmospheric and planetary surface science.12 effects on human societyedit  shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones such shipwrecks can change the course of history15 as well as influence art and literature a hurricane led to a victory of the spanish over the french for control of fort caroline and ultimately the atlantic coast of north america in 1565.16 strong winds from any storm type can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles in the united states major hurricanes comprise just 21 of all landfalling tropical cyclones but account for 83 of all damage.17 tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts.18 tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges overpasses and roads complicating efforts to transport food clean water and medicine to the areas that need it furthermore the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region and to a diaspora of the population of the region.19 the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths.19 the relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles/kilometers inland flooding homes and cutting off escape routes the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales cloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting.20 under a regime of low precipitation lp thunderstorms where little precipitation is present rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat.21 wildfires can devastate vegetation and the biodiversity of an ecosystem wildfires that occur close to urban environments can inflict damages upon infrastructures buildings crops and provide risks to explosions should the flames be exposed to gas pipes direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion.22 in areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning like florida lightning causes several fatalities per year most commonly to people working outside.23 precipitation with low potential of hydrogen levels ph otherwise known as acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning distilled water which contains no carbon dioxide has a neutral ph of 7 liquids with a ph less than 7 are acidic and those with a ph greater than 7 are bases clean or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2 because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid a weak acid ph 5.6 in distilled water but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals.24 nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena25 caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules can result in the production of acid rain if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation thus creating acid rain acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon in ecosystems acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.26 various hazards ranging from hail to lightning can affect outside technology facilities such as antennas satellite dishes and towers as a result companies with outside facilities have begun installing such facilities underground in order to reduce the risk of damage from storms.31 substantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely populations living in snow-prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow such as skis snowshoes and sleds pulled by horses dogs or other animals and later snowmobiles basic utilities such as electricity telephone lines and gas supply can also fail in addition snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck.32 the combined effects can lead to a snow day on which gatherings such as school work or church are officially canceled in areas that normally have very little or no snow a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow in some areas such as some states in the united states schools are given a yearly quota of snow days or calamity days once the quota is exceeded the snow days must be made up.333435 in other states all snow days must be made up.36 for example schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon shorten spring break or delay the start of summer vacation accumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer and to decrease the long-term effect of a heavy snowfall this process utilizes shovels and snowplows and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride-based chemicals which reduce the melting temperature of snow.37 in some areas with abundant snowfall such as yamagata prefecture japan people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses this allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods.38 agricultureedit aviationedit recreationedit many winter sports such as skiing49 snowboarding50 snowmobiling51 and snowshoeing depend upon snow where snow is scarce but the temperature is low enough snow cannons may be used to produce an adequate amount for such sports.52 children and adults can play on a sled or ride in a sleigh although a person's footsteps remain a visible lifeline within a snow-covered landscape snow cover is considered a general danger to hiking since the snow obscures landmarks and makes the landscape itself appear uniform.53 notable storms in art and cultureedit in mythology and literatureedit according to the bible a giant storm sent by god flooded the earth noah and his family and the animals entered the ark and the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. the flood covered even the highest mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet and all creatures died only noah and those with him on the ark were left alive in the new testament jesus christ is recorded to have calmed a storm on the sea of galilee the gilgamesh flood myth is a deluge story in the epic of gilgamesh in greek mythology there were several gods of storms briareos the god of sea storms aigaios a god of the violent sea storms and aiolos keeper of storm-winds squalls and tempests the sea venture was wrecked near bermuda in 1609 which led to the colonization of bermuda54 and provided the inspiration for shakespeare's play the tempest1611.55 specifically sir thomas gates future governor of virginia was on his way to england from jamestown virginia on saint james day while he was between cuba and the bahamas a hurricane raged for nearly two days though one of the small vessels in the fleet sank to the bottom of the florida straits seven of the remaining vessels reached virginia within several days after the storm the flagship of the fleet known as sea adventure disappeared and was presumed lost a small bit of fortune befell the ship and her crew when they made landfall on bermuda the vessel was damaged on a surrounding coral reef but all aboard survived for nearly a year on the island the british colonists claimed the island and quickly settled bermuda in may 1610 they set forth for jamestown this time arriving at their destination the children's novel the wonderful wizard of oz written by l frank baum and illustrated by w w denslow chronicles the adventures of a young girl named dorothy gale in the land of oz after being swept away from her kansas farm home by a tornado the story was originally published by the george m hill company in chicago on may 17 1900 and has since been reprinted numerous times most often under the name the wizard of oz and adapted for use in other media thanks in part to the 1939 mgm movie it is one of the best-known stories in american popular culture and has been widely translated its initial success and the success of the popular 1902 broadway musical which baum adapted from his original story led to baum's writing thirteen more oz books numerous other accounts of the galveston hurricane of 1900 have been made in print and in film larson cites many of them in isaac's storm which centrally features that storm as well as chronicles the creation of the weather bureau which came to known as the national weather service and that agency's fateful rivalry with the weather service in cuba and a number of other major storms such as those which ravaged indianola texas in 1875 and 1886.56 hurricane katrina 2005 has been featured in a number of works of fiction in fine artedit the romantic seascape painters j m w turner and ivan aivazovsky created some of the most lasting impressions of the sublime and stormy seas that are firmly imprinted on the popular mind turner's representations of powerful natural forces reinvented the traditional seascape during the first half of the nineteenth century in motion picturesedit the 1926 silent film the johnstown flood features the great flood of 1889 in johnstown pennsylvania the flood caused by the catastrophic failure of the south fork dam after days of extremely heavy rainfall prompted the first major disaster relief effort by the american red cross directed by clara barton the johnstown flood was depicted in numerous other media both fictional and in non-fiction as well warner bros. 2000 dramatic disaster film the perfect storm directed by wolfgang petersen is an adaptation of sebastian junger's 1997 non-fiction book of the same title the book and film feature the crew of the andrea gail which got caught in the perfect storm of 1991 the 1991 perfect storm also known as the halloween nor'easter of 1991 was a nor'easter that absorbed hurricane grace and ultimately evolved into a small hurricane late in its life cycle.59 in musicedit storms were also portrayed in several works of music examples are beethoven's pastoral symphony the fourth movement presto of the violin concerto rv 315 summer from the four seasons by vivaldi and a scene in act ii of rossini's opera the barber of seville galleryedit lightning within the cloud causes the entire blanket to illuminate high desert storm approaches at sunset heavy storm brought by severe tropical storm sanvu in

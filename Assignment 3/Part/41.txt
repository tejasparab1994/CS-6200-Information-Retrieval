mesocyclone a mesocyclone is a vortex of air within a convective storm.1 it is air that rises and rotates around a vertical axis usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere they are most often cyclonic that is associated with a localized low-pressure region within a severe thunderstorm such thunderstorms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells within which tornadoes may form at the interchange with certain downdrafts  contents  formationedit mesocyclones form when strong changes of wind speed and/or direction with height wind shear sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls the convective updraft of a thunderstorm then draw up this spinning air tilting the rolls orientation upward from parallel to the ground to perpendicular and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column.2 as the updraft rotates and ingests cooler moister air from the forward flank downdraft ffd it may form a wall cloud a spinning layer of clouds lowered from ambient storm cloud base under the mid-level mesocyclone the wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone as it descends a funnel cloud may form near its center this is the first visible stage of tornadogenesis identificationedit the best way to detect and verify the presence of a mesocyclone is by doppler weather radar nearby high values of opposite sign within velocity data are how they are detected.3 thus the word mesocyclone is associated with weather radar terminology mesocyclones are most often identified in the right-rear flank of supercell thunderstorms and squall lines and may be distinguished by a hook echo rotation signature on a weather radar map visual cues such as a rotating wall cloud or tornado may also hint at the presence of a mesocyclone this is why the term has entered into wider usage in connection with rotating features in severe storms tornado formationedit tornado formation generally occurs in one of two ways in the first method two conditions must be first satisfied.4 one an invisible horizontal spinning effect must be first formed upon the earth's surface this is usually formed by sudden changes in wind direction or speed known as wind shear second a thundercloud or occasionally a cumulus cloud must be present during a thunderstorm the updrafts presented are occasionally powerful enough to lift the horizontal spinning row of air upwards turning it into a vertical air column this vertical air column then becomes the basic structure for the tornado tornadoes that form in this way are often classified as weak tornadoes and generally last for less than 10 minutes.4 the second method of formation occurs during the occurrence of a supercell thunderstorm this type of tornado forms by the updrafts present in the supercell thunderstorm when winds occurring during this phenomenon increase and intensify the force released can cause the updrafts to rotate this rotating updraft is known as a mesocyclone.5 for a tornado to form in this manner a downdraft called the rear-flank downdraft enters the center of the mesocyclone from the back cold air being denser than warm air is able to penetrate through the updraft the combination of the updraft and downdraft completes the development of a tornado tornadoes that form in this method are often classified as violent and are capable of lasting for more than one hour.4 mesoscale convective vortexedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

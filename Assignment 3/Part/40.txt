cyclone in meteorology a cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure.12 cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure.34 the largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale the synoptic scale warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.5 mesocyclones tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale.6 upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the northern hemisphere cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets such as mars and neptune.78 cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification.9 extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones these zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies later in their life cycle extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems a cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream weather fronts mark the boundary between two masses of air of different temperature humidity and densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity and are warm core.10 cyclones can transition between extratropical subtropical and tropical phases mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land and can lead to tornado formation.11 waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear.12 in the atlantic and the northeastern pacific oceans a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane from the name of the ancient central american deity of wind huracan in the indian and south pacific oceans it is called a cyclone and in the northwestern pacific it is called a typhoon.13  contents  nomenclature henry piddington published almost 40 papers dealing with tropical storms from calcutta between 1835 and 1855 in the journal of the asiatic society he also coined the term cyclone meaning the coil of a snake in 1842 he published his landmark thesis laws of the storms.14 structure there are a number of structural characteristics common to all cyclones a cyclone is a low-pressure area.15 a cyclone's center often known in a mature tropical cyclone as the eye is the area of lowest atmospheric pressure in the region.15 near the center the pressure gradient force from the pressure in the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone and the force from the coriolis effect must be in an approximate balance or the cyclone would collapse on itself as a result of the difference in pressure.16 because of the coriolis effect the wind flow around a large cyclone is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.17 in the northern hemisphere the fastest winds relative to the surface of the earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward-moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward-moving one the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere.18 in contrast to low pressure systems the wind flow around high pressure systems are clockwise anticyclonic in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere formation cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere.9 cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in the development of some sort of cyclone it can occur at various scales from the microscale to the synoptic scale extratropical cyclones begin as waves along weather fronts before occluding later in their life cycle as cold-core systems however some intense extratropical cyclones can become warm-core systems when a warm seclusion occurs a surface low can form in a variety of ways topography can create a surface low mesoscale convective systems can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core.21 the disturbance can grow into a wave-like formation along the front and the low is positioned at the crest around the low the flow becomes cyclonic this rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator on the west side of the low while warm air move towards the pole on the east side a cold front appears on the west side while a warm front forms on the east side usually the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and catches up with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone in addition the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure denser cold air mass the cold front over takes the warm front and reduces the length of the warm front.22 at this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft which is also known as a trowal.23 tropical cyclogenesis is the term that describes the development and strengthening of a tropical cyclone.24 the mechanisms by which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those that produce mid-latitude cyclones tropical cyclogenesis the development of a warm-core cyclone begins with significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis synoptic scale the following types of cyclones are identifiable in synoptic charts surface-based types there are three main types of surface-based cyclones extratropical cyclones subtropical cyclones and tropical cyclones extratropical cyclone an extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale of low-pressure weather system that does not have tropical characteristics as it is connected with fronts and horizontal gradients rather than vertical in temperature and dew point otherwise known as baroclinic zones.28 extratropical is applied to cyclones outside the tropics in the middle latitudes these systems may also be described as mid-latitude cyclones due to their area of formation or post-tropical cyclones when a tropical cyclone has moved extratropical transition beyond the tropics.2829 they are often described as depressions or lows by weather forecasters and the general public these are the everyday phenomena that along with anti-cyclones drive weather over much of the earth although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius.30 an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core and as a result develops central convection.31 a particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter subtropical a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone they can form between the equator and the 50th parallel.34 as early as the 1950s meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids.35 by 1972 the national hurricane center officially recognized this cyclone category.36 subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the atlantic basin in 2002.34 they have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.34 tropical a tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain a tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist air rises resulting in condensation of water vapour contained in the moist air they are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor'easters european windstorms and polar lows leading to their classification as warm core storm systems.10 the term tropical refers to both the geographic origin of these systems which form almost exclusively in tropical regions of the globe and their dependence on maritime tropical air masses for their formation the term cyclone refers to the storms cyclonic nature with counterclockwise rotation in the northern hemisphere and clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere depending on their location and strength tropical cyclones are referred to by other names such as hurricane typhoon tropical storm cyclonic storm tropical depression or simply as a cyclone many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere if the conditions remain favorable the tropical disturbance intensifies and can even develop an eye on the other end of the spectrum if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall the system weakens and eventually dissipates a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses.10 a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.43 atlantic hurricane pacific typhoon north indian ocean cyclone south pacific cyclone upper level types polar cyclone tutt cell mesoscale the following types of cyclones are not identifiable in synoptic charts mesocyclone tornado a tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or in rare cases the base of a cumulus cloud also referred to as twisters a collequial term in america or cyclones although the word cyclone is used in meteorology in a wider sense to name any closed low-pressure circulation dust devil a dust devil is a strong well-formed and relatively long-lived whirlwind ranging from small half a metre wide and a few metres tall to large more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall the primary vertical motion is upward dust devils are usually harmless but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property waterspout a waterspout is a columnar vortex forming over water that is in its most common form a non-supercell tornado over water that is connected to a cumuliform cloud while it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur steam devil a gentle vortex over calm water or wet land made visible by rising water vapour fire whirl a fire whirl  also colloquially known as a fire devil fire tornado firenado or fire twister  is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash climate change scientists warn that climate change could increase the intensity of typhoons as climate change projections show that the difference in temperature between the ocean  the heat source for cyclones  and the storm tops  the cold parts of cyclones  are likely to increase.52 climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of high-intensity storms in selected ocean basins.53 while the effect changing climate is having on tropical storms remains largely unresolved54 scientists and president of vanuatu baldwin lonsdale say the devastation caused by pam was aggravated by climate change.5556 other planets cyclones are not unique to earth cyclonic storms are common on jovian planets such as the small dark spot on neptune it is about one third the diameter of the great dark spot and received the nickname wizard's eye because it looks like an eye this appearance is caused by a white cloud in the middle of the wizard's eye.8 mars has also exhibited cyclonic storms.7 jovian storms like the great red spot are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms however this is inaccurate as the great red spot is in fact the inverse phenomenon an anticyclone.57 references external links navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects

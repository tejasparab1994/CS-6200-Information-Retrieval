tropics the tropics are distinguished from the other climatic and biomatic regions of earth which are the middle latitudes and the polar regions on either side of the equatorial zone the tropics comprise 40 of the earth's surface area1 and contain 36 of the earth's landmass.2as of 2014update the region is home to 40 of the world population and this figure is projected to reach 50 by the late 2030s.3  contents  seasons and climateedit tropical is sometimes used in a general sense for a tropical climate to mean warm to hot and moist year-round often with the sense of lush vegetation when the wet season occurs during the warm season or summer precipitation falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours the wet season is a time when air quality improves freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly leading to crop yields late in the season floods cause rivers to overflow their banks and some animals to retreat to higher ground soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases the incidence of malaria increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime unfortunately the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature ecosystemsedit tropical plants and animals are those species native to the tropics tropical ecosystems may consist of tropical rainforests seasonal tropical forests dry often deciduous forests spiny forests desert and other habitat types there are often significant areas of biodiversity and species endemism present particularly in rainforests and seasonal forests some examples of important biodiversity and high endemism ecosystems are el yunque national forest in puerto rico costa rican and nicaraguan rainforests amazon rainforest territories of several south american countries madagascar dry deciduous forests the waterberg biosphere of south africa and eastern madagascar rainforests often the soils of tropical forests are low in nutrient content making them quite vulnerable to slash-and-burn deforestation techniques which are sometimes an element of shifting cultivation agricultural systems in biogeography the tropics are divided into paleotropics africa asia and australia and neotropics caribbean central america and south america together they are sometimes referred to as the pantropic the neotropical region should not be confused with the ecozone of the same name in the old world there is no such ambiguity as the paleotropics correspond to the afrotropical indomalayan and partly the australasian and oceanic ecozones tropicalityedit tropicality refers to the geographic imagery that many people outside the tropics have of that region the idea of tropicality gained renewed interest in modern geographical discourse when french geographer pierre gourou published les pays tropicaux the tropical world in english in the late 1940s.9 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

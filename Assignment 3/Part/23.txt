downburst a downburst is a strong ground-level wind system that emanates from a point source above and blows radially that is in a straight line in all directions from the point of contact at ground level often producing damaging winds it may be confused with a tornado where high-velocity winds circle a central area and air moves inward and upward by contrast in a downburst winds are directed downward and then outward from the surface landing point downbursts are created by an area of significantly rain-cooled air that after reaching ground level spreads out in all directions producing strong winds dry downbursts are associated with thunderstorms with very little rain while wet downbursts are created by thunderstorms with high amounts of rainfall microbursts and macrobursts are downbursts at very small and larger scales respectively another variety the heat burst is created by vertical currents on the backside of old outflow boundaries and squall lines where rainfall is lacking heat bursts generate significantly higher temperatures due to the lack of rain-cooled air in their formation downbursts create vertical wind shear or microbursts which is dangerous to aviation  contents  definitionedit straight-line windsedit straight-line winds may be damaging to marine interests small ships cutters and sailboats are at risk from this meteorological phenomenon.citation needed formationedit the formation of a downburst starts with hail or large raindrops falling through drier air hailstones melt and raindrops evaporate pulling latent heat from surrounding air and cooling it considerably cooler air has a higher density than the warmer air around it so it sinks to the ground as the cold air hits the ground it spreads out and a mesoscale front can be observed as a gust front areas under and immediately adjacent to the downburst are the areas which receive the highest winds and rainfall if any is present also because the rain-cooled air is descending from the middle troposphere a significant drop in temperatures is noticed due to interaction with the ground the downburst quickly loses strength as it fans out and forms the distinctive curl shape that is commonly seen at the periphery of the microburst see image downbursts usually last only a few minutes and then dissipate except in the case of squall lines and derecho events however despite their short lifespan microbursts are a serious hazard to aviation and property and can result in substantial damage to the area heat burstsedit danger to aviationedit downbursts particularly microbursts are exceedingly dangerous to aircraft which are taking off or landing due to the strong vertical wind shear caused by these events a number of fatal crashes have been attributed to downbursts.9 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

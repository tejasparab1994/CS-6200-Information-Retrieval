Tropical cyclone A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center  a closed low-level atmospheric circulation  strong winds  and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. Depending on its location and strength  a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names  including hurricane  [1][2][3] typhoon  tropical storm  cyclonic storm  tropical depression  and simply cyclone.[4] A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; while in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean  comparable storms are referred to simply as or cyclonic refers to the geographical origin of these systems  which form almost exclusively over tropical seas. refers to their winds moving in a circle [5] whirling round their central clear eye  with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and blowing clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface  which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation. This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms  such as nor'easters and European windstorms  which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts. Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2 (62 and 1 in diameter. The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result  they rarely form within of the equator.[6] Tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from southwestern quartersphere  mainly because the shapes of the African and South American continents permit the Benguela and Humboldt Currents to cover ocean basins as far north as with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific  which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the Brazil Current from being so hot as analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also  the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea  along with the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool  are feature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia. Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a tropical cyclone  compared to inland regions. The primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters  therefore these forms are typically strongest when over or near water  and weaken quite rapidly over land. Coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain  high waves (due to winds)  storm surges (due to severe pressure changes)  and the potential of spawning tornadoes. Tropical cyclones also draw in air from a large can be a vast area for the most severe concentrate the precipitation of the water content in that air (made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into a much smaller area. This continual replacement of moisture-bearing air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen as rain  may cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to 40 kilometres from the coastline  far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time. Though their effects on human populations are often devastating  tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions. They also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes  which may play an important role in modulating regional and global climate. Contents Physical structure Tropical cyclones are areas of relatively low pressure in the troposphere  with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth  the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level.[7] The environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes  thus they are characterized as systems.[8] Wind field The near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air rotating rapidly around a center of circulation while also flowing radially inwards. At the outer edge of the storm  air may be nearly calm; however  due to the rotation  the air has non-zero absolute angular momentum. As air flows radially inward  it begins to rotate cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere  and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) in order to conserve angular momentum. At an inner radius  air begins to ascend to the top of the troposphere. This radius is typically coincident with the inner radius of the eyewall  and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm; consequently  it is known as the radius of maximum winds.[9] Once aloft  air flows away from the storm's center  producing a shield of cirrus clouds.[10] The previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly axisymmetric: Wind speeds are low at the center  increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds  and then decay more gradually with radius to large radii. However  the wind field often exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes  such as thunderstorm activity and horizontal flow instabilities. In the vertical direction  winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height within the troposphere.[11] Eye and center At the center of a mature tropical cyclone  air sinks rather than rises. For a sufficiently strong storm  air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress cloud formation  thereby creating a clear Weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds  although the sea may be extremely violent.[12] The eye is normally circular in shape  and is typically in diameter  though eyes as small as and as large as have been observed.[13][14] The cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the The eyewall typically expands outward with height  resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect.[14] The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found  air rises most rapidly  clouds reach to their highest altitude  and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.[12] In a weaker storm  the eye may be obscured by the central dense overcast  which is the upper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone.[15] The eyewall may vary over time in the form of eyewall replacement cycles  particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward  which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens  the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle  at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.[16] Rapid deepening On occasion  tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid deepening  a period in which the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone decreases by 42mb in a 24-hour period.[17] In order for rapid deepening to occur  several conditions must be in place. Water temperatures must be extremely high (near or above   and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell cooler waters to the surface. Wind shear must be low; when wind shear is high  the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted. Usually  an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as extremely low surface pressures to develop  air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm  and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently.[18] Size There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind  the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force)  the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI)  and the radius of vanishing wind.[20][21] An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to On Earth  tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes  from 000 kilometres as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin.[22] If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude  then the cyclone is "very small" or a "midget". A radius of latitude degrees is considered "average sized". "Very large" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed)  radius of maximum wind  latitude  and maximum potential intensity.[21][22] Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal  a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally  a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch  longer duration  and enhanced wave setup.[23] The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere  which at low latitudes is 15 000 metres (50 Physics and energetics The three-dimensional wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components: a "primary circulation" and a "secondary circulation". The primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow; it is purely circular. The secondary circulation is the overturning (in-up-out-down) part of the flow; it is in the radial and vertical directions. The primary circulation is larger in magnitude  dominating the surface wind field  and is responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes  while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the energetics of the storm. Secondary circulation: a Carnot heat engine A tropical cyclone's primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of water from the ocean surface  which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine.[26] First  inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation  the ocean cools and the air warms). Second  the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation). Third  air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally  air subsides and warms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content. The first and third legs are nearly isothermal  while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation. The Carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain. Scientists estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate of 50 to per day [27] equivalent to about This rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the world energy consumption of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity  or to exploding a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every Primary circulation: rotating winds The primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the conservation of angular momentum by the secondary circulation. Absolute angular momentum on a rotating planet M{\displaystyle M} is given by where f{\displaystyle f} is the Coriolis parameter  v{\displaystyle v} is the azimuthal (i.e. rotating) wind speed  and r{\displaystyle r} is the radius to the axis of rotation. The first term on the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local vertical (i.e. the axis of rotation). The second term on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the axis of rotation. Because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the equator (where f=0{\displaystyle f=0} )  tropical cyclones rarely form within of the equator.[6][29] As air flows radially inward at low levels  it begins to rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly  as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause  its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius  resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone. The result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from thermal wind balance  this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. From hydrostatic balance  the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes  with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.[11] Maximum potential intensity Due to surface friction  the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum. Thus  the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source (evaporation) and sink (friction) of energy for the system. This fact leads to the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain. Because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed (just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day)  there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the Wind-Induced Surface Heat Exchange (WISHE) feedback.[26] This feedback is offset when frictional dissipation  which increases with the cube of the wind speed  becomes sufficiently large. This upper bound is called the potential  vp{\displaystyle v_{p}}  and is given by where Ts{\displaystyle T_{s}} is the temperature of the sea surface  To{\displaystyle T_{o}} is the temperature of the outflow ([K])  \Delta k} is the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air ([J/kg])  and Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}} and Cd{\displaystyle C_{d}} are the surface exchange coefficients (dimensionless) of enthalpy and momentum  respectively.[30] The surface-air enthalpy difference is taken as \Delta k=k_{s}^{*}-k}  where k_{s}^{*}} is the saturation enthalpy of air at sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure and k{\displaystyle k} is the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surface. The maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background environment alone (i.e. without a tropical cyclone)  and thus this quantity can be used to determine which regions on Earth can support tropical cyclones of a given intensity  and how these regions may evolve in time.[31][32] Specifically  the maximum potential intensity has three components  but its variability in space and time is due predominantly to the variability in the surface-air enthalpy difference component \Delta k}. Derivation A tropical cyclone may be viewed as a heat engine that converts input heat energy from the surface into mechanical energy that can be used to do mechanical work against surface friction. At equilibrium  the rate of net energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to frictional dissipation at the surface  i.e. The rate of energy loss per unit surface area from surface friction  Wout{\displaystyle W_{out}}  is given by where \rho } is the density of near-surface air ([kg/m3]) and |u|{\displaystyle |\mathbf {u} |} is the near surface wind speed ([m/s]). The rate of energy production per unit surface area  Win{\displaystyle W_{in}} is given by where \epsilon } is the heat engine efficiency and Qin{\displaystyle Q_{in}} is the total rate of heat input into the system per unit surface area. Given that a tropical cyclone may be idealized as a Carnot heat engine  the Carnot heat engine efficiency is given by Heat (enthalpy) per unit mass is given by where Cp{\displaystyle C_{p}} is the heat capacity of air  T{\displaystyle T} is air temperature  Lv{\displaystyle L_{v}} is the latent heat of vaporization  and q{\displaystyle q} is the concentration of water vapor. The first component corresponds to sensible heat and the second to latent heat. There are two sources of heat input. The dominant source is the input of heat at the surface  primarily due to evaporation. The bulk aerodynamic formula for the rate of heat input per unit area at the surface  Qin:k{\displaystyle Q_{in:k}}  is given by where \Delta k=k_{s}^{*}-k} represents the enthalpy difference between the ocean surface and the overlying air. The second source is the internal sensible heat generated from frictional dissipation (equal to Wout{\displaystyle W_{out}})  which occurs near the surface within the tropical cyclone and is recycled to the system. Thus  the total rate of net energy production per unit surface area is given by Setting Win=Wout{\displaystyle W_{in}=W_{out}} and taking |\mathbf {u} |\approx v} (i.e. the rotational wind speed is dominant) leads to the solution for vp{\displaystyle v_{p}} given above. This derivation assumes that total energy input and loss within the system can be approximated by their values at the radius of maximum wind. The inclusion of Qin:friction{\displaystyle Q_{in:friction}} acts to multiply the total heat input rate by the factor TsTo{\displaystyle {\frac {T_{s}}{T_{o}}}}. Mathematically  this has the effect of replacing Ts{\displaystyle T_{s}} with To{\displaystyle T_{o}} in the denominator of the Carnot efficiency. An alternative definition for the maximum potential intensity  which is mathematically equivalent to the above formulation  is where CAPE stands for the Convective Available Potential Energy  CAPE_{s}^{*}} is the CAPE of an air parcel lifted from saturation at sea level in reference to the environmental sounding  CAPEb{\displaystyle CAPE_{b}} is the CAPE of the boundary layer air  and both quantities are calculated at the radius of maximum wind.[33] Characteristic values and variability on Earth On Earth  a characteristic temperature for Ts{\displaystyle T_{s}} is 300 K and for To{\displaystyle T_{o}} is 200 K  corresponding to a Carnot efficiency of \epsilon =1/3}. The ratio of the surface exchange coefficients  Ck/Cd{\displaystyle C_{k}/C_{d}}  is typically taken to be 1. However  observations suggest that the drag coefficient Cd{\displaystyle C_{d}} varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane.[34] Additionally  Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}} may vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of sea spray on evaporation within the boundary layer.[35] A characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity  vp{\displaystyle v_{p}}  is 80 metres per second However  this quantity varies significantly across space and time  particularly within the seasonal cycle  spanning a range of 0 to 100 metres per second (0 to 0 to This variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium ( \Delta k} ) as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere  which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate. These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and underlying ocean dynamics)  background near-surface wind speed  and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating.[36] The nature of this modulation is complex  particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer). On shorter time-scales  variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean  as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water.[37] However  this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics of the tropics; the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on vp{\displaystyle v_{p}} is weak in comparison. Interaction with the upper ocean The passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially  which can influence subsequent cyclone development. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening. Additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean  by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.[38] Major basins and related warning centers There are six Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMCs) worldwide. These organizations are designated by the World Meteorological Organization and are responsible for tracking and issuing bulletins  warnings  and advisories about tropical cyclones in their designated areas of responsibility. In addition  there are six Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWCs) that provide information to smaller regions.[44] The RSMCs and TCWCs are not the only organizations that provide information about tropical cyclones to the public. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues advisories in all basins except the Northern Atlantic for the purposes of the United States Government.[45] The Philippine Atmospheric  Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issues advisories and names for tropical cyclones that approach the Philippines in the Northwestern Pacific to protect the life and property of its citizens.[46] The Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issues advisories on hurricanes and their remnants for Canadian citizens when they affect Canada.[47] On March 26  2004  Hurricane Catarina became the first recorded South Atlantic cyclone  striking southern Brazil with winds equivalent to on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the cyclone formed outside the authority of another warning center  Brazilian meteorologists initially treated the system as an extratropical cyclone  but later on classified it as tropical.[48] Formation Worldwide  tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer  when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However  each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale  May is the least active month  while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active.[49] Times In the Northern Atlantic Ocean  a distinct cyclone season occurs from June 1 to November 30  sharply peaking from late August through September.[49] The statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10. The Northeast Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity  but in a similar time frame to the Atlantic.[50] The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round  with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September.[49] In the North Indian basin  storms are most common from April to December  with peaks in May and November.[49] In the Southern Hemisphere  the tropical cyclone year begins on July 1 and runs all year-round encompassing the tropical cyclone seasons  which run from November 1 until the end of April  with peaks in mid-February to early March.[49][51]  Factors The formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood.[55] While six factors appear to be generally necessary  tropical cyclones may occasionally form without meeting all of the following conditions. In most situations  water temperatures of at least are needed down to a depth of at least waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms.[57] For tropical transitioning cyclones (i.e. Hurricane Ophelia (2017)) a water temperature of at least has been suggested.[58] Another factor is rapid cooling with height  which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone.[56] High humidity is needed  especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere; when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere  conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop.[56] Low amounts of wind shear are needed  as high shear is disruptive to the storm's circulation.[56] Tropical cyclones generally need to form more than or five degrees of latitude away from the equator  allowing the Coriolis effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating a circulation.[56] Lastly  a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather. Tropical cyclones will not form spontaneously.[56] Low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances.[59] Locations Most tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity near the equator  referred to as the Intertropical Front (ITF)  the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)  or the monsoon trough.[60][61][62] Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves  which contribute to the development of about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific.[63][64][65] The majority forms between 10 and of latitude away of the equator [66] and 87% forms no farther away than north or south.[67][68] Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation  tropical cyclones rarely form or move within of the equator  where the effect is weakest.[67] However  it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004  respectively.[69][70] Movement The movement of a tropical cyclone (i.e. its "track") is typically approximated as the sum of two terms: "steering" by the background environmental wind and "beta drift".[71] Environmental steering Environmental steering is the dominant term. Conceptually  it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions  similar to "leaves carried along by a stream".[72] Physically  the winds  or flow field  in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself  and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place. In this way  tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as advection of the storm by the local environmental flow. This environmental flow is termed the "steering flow". Climatologically  tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west trade winds on the equatorial side of the subtropical persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans.[72] In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans  the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea  North America  and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out.[64] These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region.[63] In contrast  in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres  tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough.[73] Additionally  tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems  such as extratropical cyclones. Beta drift In addition to environmental steering  a tropical cyclone will tend to drift slowly poleward and westward  a motion known as "beta drift". This motion is due to the superposition of a vortex  such as a tropical cyclone  onto an environment in which the Coriolis force varies with latitude  such as on a sphere or beta plane. It is induced indirectly by the storm itself  the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environment. Physically  the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center. Because air must conserve its angular momentum  this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs even if there is zero environmental flow. Multiple storm interaction A third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the interaction of multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another  their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength  the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size  the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction  and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect  after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.[74] Interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies Though a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics  its track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow  such as the jet stream or an extratropical cyclone. This motion  termed "recurvature"  commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean basins  where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical cyclones are common.[75] An example of tropical cyclone recurvature was Typhoon Ioke in 2006.[76] Landfall The landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm's surface center moves over a coastline.[9] Storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall; in fact  a tropical cyclone can launch its strongest winds over land  yet not make landfall. NOAA uses the term "direct hit" to describe when a location (on the left side of the eye) falls within the radius of maximum winds (or twice that radius if on the right side)  whether or not the hurricane's eye made landfall.[9] Dissipation Factors A tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways. One such way is if it moves over land  thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself  quickly losing strength.[77] Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two  or evolve into extratropical cyclones. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water  such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time  weakening will accelerate.[78] Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain  when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall.[79] This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides  as was the case with Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998.[80] Without warm surface water  the storm cannot survive.[81] A tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below This will cause the storm to lose its tropical characteristics  such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center  and become a remnant low-pressure area. These remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity. This dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern North Pacific.[82] Weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear  causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center; this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone.[83] In addition  its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies  by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone  can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into extratropical cyclones. This transition can take Even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated  it can still have tropical storm force (or occasionally hurricane/typhoon force) winds and drop several inches of rainfall. In the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean  such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of North America. These phenomena can also affect Europe  where they are known as European windstorms; Hurricane Iris's extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995.[85] A cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure  becoming a larger area of low pressure. This can strengthen the resultant system  although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone.[83] Studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones.[86] Artificial dissipation In the 1960s and 1970s  the United States government attempted to weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It was thought that the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze  causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds.[87] The winds of Hurricane hurricane seeded in Project as much as 31%  but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays.[88] In an earlier episode in 1947  disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville  Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded  and smashed into Savannah  Georgia.[89] Because there was so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms  the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within  greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes  casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today  it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.[90] Other approaches have been suggested over time  including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans.[91] Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation [92] dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice  instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop) [91] or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons.[93] Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone.[94] These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived for any of the weakening techniques to be practical.[95] Effects Tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves  heavy rain  flood and high winds  disrupting international shipping and  at times  causing shipwrecks.[96] Tropical cyclones stir up water  leaving a cool wake behind them  which causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones.[38] On land  strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles  buildings  bridges  and other outside objects  turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The storm surge  or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone  is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones  historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.[97] The broad rotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone  and vertical wind shear at its periphery  spawns tornadoes. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices  which persist until landfall.[98] Over the past two centuries  tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection  as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation.[97] Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure  leading to power outages  bridge destruction  and the hampering of reconstruction efforts.[97][99] On average  the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes  category 3 or greater. However  category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.[100] Although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property  they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact  as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.[101] Tropical cyclones also help maintain the global heat balance by moving warm  moist tropical air to the middle latitudes and polar regions [102] and by regulating the thermohaline circulation through upwelling.[103] The storm surge and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures  but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries  which are typically important fish breeding locales. Tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment  greatly increasing local property values.[104] When hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean  salt is introduced to many freshwater areas and raises the salinity levels too high for some habitats to withstand. Some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the ocean  but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it. Because of this  some species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt.[105] In addition  hurricanes can carry toxins and acids onto shore when they make landfall. The flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over. The toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area  as well as the environment around them. The flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills.[106] Observation and forecasting Observation Intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge  as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon  and weather stations  being relatively sparse  are rarely available on the site of the storm itself. In general  surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area  or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone  where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason  there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.[107] Tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space  usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land  it can be observed by land-based Doppler weather radar. Radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes.[108] In situ measurements  in real-time  can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin  these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters.[109] The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions  both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature  humidity  pressure  and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde  a small drone aircraft  was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.[110] Forecasting Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks  accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas  and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system. The deep layer mean flow  or average wind through the depth of the troposphere  is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared  use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude  such as at the pressure surface (3 000 metres or 9 800 feet above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term wobbles of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory.[111] High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones  as well as with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors  scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.[112] However  scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones.[113] The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development. New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.[44][114][115][116][117] Classifications  terminology  and naming Intensity classifications Tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups  based on intensity: tropical depressions  tropical storms  and a third group of more intense storms  whose name depends on the region. For example  if a tropical storm in the Northwestern Pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the Beaufort scale  it is referred to as a typhoon; if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the Northeast Pacific Basin  or in the North Atlantic  it is called a hurricane.[9] Neither "hurricane" nor "typhoon" is used in either the Southern Hemisphere or the Indian Ocean. In these basins  storms of a tropical nature are referred to as either tropical cyclones  severe tropical cyclones or very intense tropical cyclones. As indicated in the table below  each basin uses a separate system of terminology  which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean  hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific  becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions  the reverse will occur.[118] It should also be noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s)  over 150 miles per hour  are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.[119] Tropical depression A tropical depression or tropical low is a tropical disturbance that has a clearly defined surface circulation with maximum sustained winds of less than Within the Southern Hemisphere  the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or more quadrants  but not near the centre.[43] Tropical storm A tropical storm is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between 34 knots and 64 knots At this point  the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop  although an eye is not usually present. Government weather services first assign names to systems that reach this intensity (thus the term named storm).[120] Although tropical storms are less intense than a hurricane they can produce significant damage. The shear force of winds can blow off shingles  and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines  roofing and siding. More dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland flooding.[121] Hurricane or typhoon A hurricane or typhoon (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone  as opposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least A cyclone of this intensity tends to develop an eye  an area of relative calm (and lowest atmospheric pressure) at the center of circulation. The eye is often visible in satellite images as a small  circular  cloud-free spot. Surrounding the eye is the eyewall  an area about 16 kilometres to 80 kilometres wide in which the strongest thunderstorms and winds circulate around the storm's center. Maximum sustained winds in the strongest tropical cyclones have been estimated at about Origin of storm terms The word typhoon  which is used today in the Northwest Pacific  may be derived from Arabic (similar in Hindustani and Persian)  which in turn originates from Greek Typhon  a monster from Greek mythology associated with storms.[123] The related Portuguese word  used in Portuguese for typhoons  is also derived from Typhon.[124][disputed (for: folk etymology?) discuss] The word is also similar to Chinese (Simplified Chinese:  Traditional Chinese: = wind)  "toifung" in Cantonese  in Japanese  and "taepung" in Korean. The word hurricane  used in the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific  is derived from  the Spanish word for the Carib/Taino storm god  This god is believed by scholars to have been at least partially derived from the Mayan creator god  Huracan. Huracan was believed by the Maya to have created dry land out of the turbulent waters. The god was also credited with later destroying the "wooden people"  the precursors to the "maize people"  with an immense storm and flood.[125][126] Huracan is also the source of the word orcan  another word for a particularly strong European windstorm.[126] Naming The practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years  with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming.[127][128] The system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems in a brief form  that is readily understood and recognized by the public.[127][128] The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907.[127][128] This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired  until it was revived in the latter part of World War II for the Western Pacific.[127][128] Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North and South Atlantic  Eastern  Central  Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.[128] At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts  watches  and warnings.[127] Since the systems can last a week or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time  the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being described.[127] Names are assigned in order from predetermined lists with one  three  or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than depending on which basin it originates.[39][41][42] However  standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific  while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named within the Southern Hemisphere.[42][43] The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean  Pacific Ocean  and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name.[39][40][43] Notable tropical cyclones Tropical cyclones that cause extreme destruction are rare  although when they occur  they can cause great amounts of damage or thousands of fatalities. The 1970 Bhola cyclone is the deadliest tropical cyclone on record  killing more than 300 and potentially as many as after striking the densely populated Ganges Delta region of Bangladesh on November 13  1970. Its powerful storm surge was responsible for the high death toll.[129] The North Indian cyclone basin has historically been the deadliest basin.[97][131] Elsewhere  Typhoon Nina killed nearly 100 000 in China in 1975 due to a 100-year flood that caused including the Banqiao Dam to fail.[132] The Great Hurricane of 1780 is the deadliest North Atlantic hurricane on record  killing about 22 in the Lesser Antilles.[133] A tropical cyclone does not need to be particularly strong to cause memorable damage  primarily if the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides. Tropical Storm Thelma in November 1991 killed thousands in the Philippines [134] although the strongest typhoon to ever make landfall on record was Typhoon Haiyan on November 2013  causing widespread devastation in Eastern Visayas and killing at least 6 300 people in that country alone. In 1982  the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul killed around 1 in Central America.[135] Hurricane Harvey is estimated as the costliest tropical cyclone worldwide [136] with an estimated in damages (2017 USD). Harvey killed at least in August 2017 after making landfall in Texas as a low-end Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Katrina is estimated as the second-costliest tropical cyclone worldwide [137] causing in property damage with overall damage estimates exceeding Katrina killed at least 1 after striking Louisiana and Mississippi as a major hurricane in August 2005.[138] Hurricane Sandy is the third most destructive tropical cyclone in U.S history  with damage totaling  and with damage costs at  Hurricane Ike is the fourth most destructive tropical cyclone in U.S history. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 is the deadliest natural disaster in the United States  killing an estimated 6 000 to 12 in Galveston  Texas.[139] Hurricane Mitch caused more than 10 000 fatalities in Central America  making it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history. Hurricane Iniki in 1992 was the most powerful storm to strike Hawaii in recorded history  hitting Kauai as a hurricane  killing six people  and causing U.S. in damage.[140] Kauai was also struck by Hurricanes Dot (1959) and Iwa (1982) (see List of Hawaii hurricanes). Other destructive Eastern Pacific hurricanes include Pauline and Kenna  both causing severe damage after striking Mexico as major hurricanes.[141][142] In March 2004  Cyclone Gafilo struck northeastern Madagascar as a powerful cyclone  killing 74  affecting more than 200 000  and becoming the worst cyclone to affect the nation for more than The most intense storm on record was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979  which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots or 190 miles per hour The highest maximum sustained wind speed ever recorded was 185 knots or 215 miles per hour in Hurricane Patricia in 2015  which is the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.[145] Typhoon Nancy in 1961 also had recorded wind speeds of 185 knots or 215 miles per hour  but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high  and this is no longer considered the storm with the highest wind speeds on record.[122] Likewise  a surface-level gust caused by Typhoon Paka on Guam in late 1997 was recorded at 205 knots or 235 miles per hour Had it been confirmed  it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded on the Earth's surface  but the reading had to be discarded since the anemometer was damaged by the storm.[146] The World Meteorological Organization established Barrow Island as the location of the highest non-tornado related wind gust at The gust occurred on 10 April 1996  during Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia and is documented in the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal.[148] In addition to being the most intense tropical cyclone on record based on pressure  Tip was the largest cyclone on record  with tropical storm-force winds 2 170 kilometres (1 in diameter. The smallest storm on record  Tropical Storm Marco  formed during October 2008  and made landfall in Veracruz. Marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres in diameter.[149] Hurricane John is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record  lasting in 1994. Before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961  however  many tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations.[150] John is also the longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record  which had a path of 8 (13 Cyclone Rewa of the South Pacific and Australian region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks observed within the Southern Hemisphere  traveling a distance of over 5 (8 during December 1993 and January 1994.[151] Changes caused by El Oscillation Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator  then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies.[152] When the subtropical ridge position shifts due to El  so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience much fewer tropical cyclone impacts during El and neutral years. During El years  the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near which would favor the Japanese archipelago.[153] During El years  Guam's chance of a tropical cyclone impact is one-third more likely than of the long-term average.[154] The tropical Atlantic Ocean experiences depressed activity due to increased vertical wind shear across the region during El years.[155] During La years  the formation of tropical cyclones  along with the subtropical ridge position  shifts westward across the western Pacific Ocean  which increases the landfall threat to China and much greater intensity in the Philippines.[153] Long-term activity trends While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995  there is no obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about (Between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually). However  the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins  primarily in the Southern Hemisphere [156] while noting that a significant downward trend in tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region near Australia (based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of the El Oscillation).[157] In spite of that  there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. Kerry Emanuel stated  "Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past or so  corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime."[158] Atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially  as evidenced by the fact that five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization  "recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has been caused largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions."[159] Political scientist Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland US hurricane damage from to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade was the second most damaging among the past 11 decades  with only the decade surpassing its costs. Often in part because of the threat of hurricanes  many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore  the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes  therefore  experts regard the early data as suspect.[160] The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a cycle  also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging major hurricanes per year and lasting  and six other averaging major hurricanes per year and lasting These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout  a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by per year.[161] Although more common since 1995  few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960  including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933  a record only recently exceeded in 2005  which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of however  many intense storms formed during During the 1887 season  19 tropical storms formed  of which a record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however  many struck in the early 19th century  including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.[163] These active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960  tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one  a ship reported a voyage through the storm  or a storm hit land in a populated area.[160] Proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia.[164][165] Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD  when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by times. This millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High [165] which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic oscillation.[166] According to the Azores High hypothesis  an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods  a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period  more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP [167] and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past  just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.  Climate change The 2007 IPCC report noted many observed changes in the climate  including atmospheric composition  global average temperatures  ocean conditions  and others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition  the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century  and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.[168] P.J. Webster and others published in 2005 an article in Science examining the "changes in tropical cyclone number  duration  and intensity" over the past  the period when satellite data has been available. Their main finding was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north Atlantic Ocean  there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones.[169] According to 2006 studies by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere".[170] Studies published since 2008  by Kerry Emanuel from MIT  indicate that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity.[171] In an article in Nature  Kerry Emanuel stated that potential hurricane destructiveness  a measure combining hurricane strength  duration  and frequency  "is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature  reflecting well-documented climate signals  including multidecadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific  and global warming". Emanuel predicted "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century".[172] Research reported in the September 3  2008 issue of Nature found that the strongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger  in particular over the North Atlantic and Indian oceans. Wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms increased from an average of in 1981 to in 2006  while the ocean temperature  averaged globally over all the regions where tropical cyclones form  increased from to during this period.[173][174] A 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods  storm surge  and terrestrial flooding (rivers)  and projects an increase due to global warming.[175][176] Related cyclone types In addition to tropical cyclones  there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types. These kinds of cyclones  known as extratropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones  can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation.[177] An extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences  which are typical in higher latitudes. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses; although not as frequently  an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm  and from there into a tropical cyclone.[178] From space  extratropical storms have a characteristic "comma-shaped" cloud pattern.[179] Extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high seas.[180] A subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes  from the equator to Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds  they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm.[181] From an operational standpoint  a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.[182] Popular culture In popular culture  tropical cyclones have made several appearances in different types of media  including films  books  television  music  and electronic games.[183] These media often portray tropical cyclones that are either entirely fictional or based on real events.[183] For example  George Rippey Stewart's Storm  a best-seller published in 1941  is thought to have influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female names to Pacific tropical cyclones.[128] Another example is the hurricane in The Perfect Storm  which describes the sinking of the Andrea Gail by the 1991 Perfect Storm.[184] Hypothetical hurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such as The Simpsons  Invasion  Family Guy  Seinfeld  Dawson's Creek  Burn Notice and CSI: Miami.[183][185][186][187][188][189] The 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow includes several mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features fantastical "hurricane-like"  albeit non-tropical  Arctic storms.[190][191] See also Forecasting and preparation Annual seasons References External links Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers Reference  Navigation menu Personal tools Namespaces Variants Views More Search Navigation Interaction Tools Print/export In other projects Languages 
Tropical cyclone A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center  a closed low-level atmospheric circulation  strong winds  and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. Depending on its location and strength  a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names  including hurricane  [1][2][3] typhoon  tropical storm  cyclonic storm  tropical depression  and simply cyclone.[4] A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; while in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean  comparable storms are referred to simply as or cyclonic refers to the geographical origin of these systems  which form almost exclusively over tropical seas. refers to their winds moving in a circle [5] whirling round their central clear eye  with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and blowing clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface  which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation. This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms  such as nor'easters and European windstorms  which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts. Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2 (62 and 1 in diameter. The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result  they rarely form within of the equator.[6] Tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from southwestern quartersphere  mainly because the shapes of the African and South American continents permit the Benguela and Humboldt Currents to cover ocean basins as far north as with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific  which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the Brazil Current from being so hot as analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also  the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea  along with the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool  are feature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia. Coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a tropical cyclone  compared to inland regions. The primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters  therefore these forms are typically strongest when over or near water  and weaken quite rapidly over land. Coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain  high waves (due to winds)  storm surges (due to severe pressure changes)  and the potential of spawning tornadoes. Tropical cyclones also draw in air from a large can be a vast area for the most severe concentrate the precipitation of the water content in that air (made up from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into a much smaller area. This continual replacement of moisture-bearing air by new moisture-bearing air after its moisture has fallen as rain  may cause extremely heavy rain and river flooding up to 40 kilometres from the coastline  far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time. Though their effects on human populations are often devastating  tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions. They also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes  which may play an important role in modulating regional and global climate. Contents Physical structure Tropical cyclones are areas of relatively low pressure in the troposphere  with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth  the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level.[7] The environment near the center of tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes  thus they are characterized as systems.[8] Wind field The near-surface wind field of a tropical cyclone is characterized by air rotating rapidly around a center of circulation while also flowing radially inwards. At the outer edge of the storm  air may be nearly calm; however  due to the rotation  the air has non-zero absolute angular momentum. As air flows radially inward  it begins to rotate cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere  and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) in order to conserve angular momentum. At an inner radius  air begins to ascend to the top of the troposphere. This radius is typically coincident with the inner radius of the eyewall  and has the strongest near-surface winds of the storm; consequently  it is known as the radius of maximum winds.[9] Once aloft  air flows away from the storm's center  producing a shield of cirrus clouds.[10] The previously mentioned processes result in a wind field that is nearly axisymmetric: Wind speeds are low at the center  increase rapidly moving outwards to the radius of maximum winds  and then decay more gradually with radius to large radii. However  the wind field often exhibits additional spatial and temporal variability due to the effects of localized processes  such as thunderstorm activity and horizontal flow instabilities. In the vertical direction  winds are strongest near the surface and decay with height within the troposphere.[11] Eye and center At the center of a mature tropical cyclone  air sinks rather than rises. For a sufficiently strong storm  air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress cloud formation  thereby creating a clear Weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds  although the sea may be extremely violent.[12] The eye is normally circular in shape  and is typically in diameter  though eyes as small as and as large as have been observed.[13][14] The cloudy outer edge of the eye is called the The eyewall typically expands outward with height  resembling an arena football stadium; this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the stadium effect.[14] The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found  air rises most rapidly  clouds reach to their highest altitude  and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.[12] In a weaker storm  the eye may be obscured by the central dense overcast  which is the upper-level cirrus shield that is associated with a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone.[15] The eyewall may vary over time in the form of eyewall replacement cycles  particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward  which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens  the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one at the end of the cycle  at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.[16] Rapid deepening On occasion  tropical cyclones may undergo a process known as rapid deepening  a period in which the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone decreases by 42mb in a 24-hour period.[17] In order for rapid deepening to occur  several conditions must be in place. Water temperatures must be extremely high (near or above   and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not upwell cooler waters to the surface. Wind shear must be low; when wind shear is high  the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disrupted. Usually  an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as extremely low surface pressures to develop  air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm  and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently.[18] Size There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind  the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force)  the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI)  and the radius of vanishing wind.[20][21] An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to On Earth  tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes  from 000 kilometres as measured by the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin.[22] If the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude  then the cyclone is "very small" or a "midget". A radius of latitude degrees is considered "average sized". "Very large" tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed)  radius of maximum wind  latitude  and maximum potential intensity.[21][22] Size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal  a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally  a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch  longer duration  and enhanced wave setup.[23] The upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere  which at low latitudes is 15 000 metres (50 Physics and energetics The three-dimensional wind field in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components: a "primary circulation" and a "secondary circulation". The primary circulation is the rotational part of the flow; it is purely circular. The secondary circulation is the overturning (in-up-out-down) part of the flow; it is in the radial and vertical directions. The primary circulation is larger in magnitude  dominating the surface wind field  and is responsible for the majority of the damage a storm causes  while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the energetics of the storm. Secondary circulation: a Carnot heat engine A tropical cyclone's primary energy source is heat from the evaporation of water from the ocean surface  which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine.[26] First  inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation  the ocean cools and the air warms). Second  the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation). Third  air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally  air subsides and warms at the outer edge of the storm while conserving total heat content. The first and third legs are nearly isothermal  while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation. The Carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain. Scientists estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate of 50 to per day [27] equivalent to about This rate of energy release is equivalent to 70 times the world energy consumption of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity  or to exploding a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every Primary circulation: rotating winds The primary rotating flow in a tropical cyclone results from the conservation of angular momentum by the secondary circulation. Absolute angular momentum on a rotating planet M{\displaystyle M} is given by where f{\displaystyle f} is the Coriolis parameter  v{\displaystyle v} is the azimuthal (i.e. rotating) wind speed  and r{\displaystyle r} is the radius to the axis of rotation. The first term on the right hand side is the component of planetary angular momentum that projects onto the local vertical (i.e. the axis of rotation). The second term on the right hand side is the relative angular momentum of the circulation itself with respect to the axis of rotation. Because the planetary angular momentum term vanishes at the equator (where f=0{\displaystyle f=0} )  tropical cyclones rarely form within of the equator.[6][29] As air flows radially inward at low levels  it begins to rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly  as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause  its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius  resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone. The result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from thermal wind balance  this corresponds to a system that is warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. From hydrostatic balance  the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes  with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.[11] Maximum potential intensity Due to surface friction  the inflow only partially conserves angular momentum. Thus  the sea surface lower boundary acts as both a source (evaporation) and sink (friction) of energy for the system. This fact leads to the existence of a theoretical upper bound on the strongest wind speed that a tropical cyclone can attain. Because evaporation increases linearly with wind speed (just as climbing out of a pool feels much colder on a windy day)  there is a positive feedback on energy input into the system known as the Wind-Induced Surface Heat Exchange (WISHE) feedback.[26] This feedback is offset when frictional dissipation  which increases with the cube of the wind speed  becomes sufficiently large. This upper bound is called the potential  vp{\displaystyle v_{p}}  and is given by where Ts{\displaystyle T_{s}} is the temperature of the sea surface  To{\displaystyle T_{o}} is the temperature of the outflow ([K])  \Delta k} is the enthalpy difference between the surface and the overlying air ([J/kg])  and Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}} and Cd{\displaystyle C_{d}} are the surface exchange coefficients (dimensionless) of enthalpy and momentum  respectively.[30] The surface-air enthalpy difference is taken as \Delta k=k_{s}^{*}-k}  where k_{s}^{*}} is the saturation enthalpy of air at sea surface temperature and sea-level pressure and k{\displaystyle k} is the enthalpy of boundary layer air overlying the surface. The maximum potential intensity is predominantly a function of the background environment alone (i.e. without a tropical cyclone)  and thus this quantity can be used to determine which regions on Earth can support tropical cyclones of a given intensity  and how these regions may evolve in time.[31][32] Specifically  the maximum potential intensity has three components  but its variability in space and time is due predominantly to the variability in the surface-air enthalpy difference component \Delta k}. Derivation A tropical cyclone may be viewed as a heat engine that converts input heat energy from the surface into mechanical energy that can be used to do mechanical work against surface friction. At equilibrium  the rate of net energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to frictional dissipation at the surface  i.e. The rate of energy loss per unit surface area from surface friction  Wout{\displaystyle W_{out}}  is given by where \rho } is the density of near-surface air ([kg/m3]) and |u|{\displaystyle |\mathbf {u} |} is the near surface wind speed ([m/s]). The rate of energy production per unit surface area  Win{\displaystyle W_{in}} is given by where \epsilon } is the heat engine efficiency and Qin{\displaystyle Q_{in}} is the total rate of heat input into the system per unit surface area. Given that a tropical cyclone may be idealized as a Carnot heat engine  the Carnot heat engine efficiency is given by Heat (enthalpy) per unit mass is given by where Cp{\displaystyle C_{p}} is the heat capacity of air  T{\displaystyle T} is air temperature  Lv{\displaystyle L_{v}} is the latent heat of vaporization  and q{\displaystyle q} is the concentration of water vapor. The first component corresponds to sensible heat and the second to latent heat. There are two sources of heat input. The dominant source is the input of heat at the surface  primarily due to evaporation. The bulk aerodynamic formula for the rate of heat input per unit area at the surface  Qin:k{\displaystyle Q_{in:k}}  is given by where \Delta k=k_{s}^{*}-k} represents the enthalpy difference between the ocean surface and the overlying air. The second source is the internal sensible heat generated from frictional dissipation (equal to Wout{\displaystyle W_{out}})  which occurs near the surface within the tropical cyclone and is recycled to the system. Thus  the total rate of net energy production per unit surface area is given by Setting Win=Wout{\displaystyle W_{in}=W_{out}} and taking |\mathbf {u} |\approx v} (i.e. the rotational wind speed is dominant) leads to the solution for vp{\displaystyle v_{p}} given above. This derivation assumes that total energy input and loss within the system can be approximated by their values at the radius of maximum wind. The inclusion of Qin:friction{\displaystyle Q_{in:friction}} acts to multiply the total heat input rate by the factor TsTo{\displaystyle {\frac {T_{s}}{T_{o}}}}. Mathematically  this has the effect of replacing Ts{\displaystyle T_{s}} with To{\displaystyle T_{o}} in the denominator of the Carnot efficiency. An alternative definition for the maximum potential intensity  which is mathematically equivalent to the above formulation  is where CAPE stands for the Convective Available Potential Energy  CAPE_{s}^{*}} is the CAPE of an air parcel lifted from saturation at sea level in reference to the environmental sounding  CAPEb{\displaystyle CAPE_{b}} is the CAPE of the boundary layer air  and both quantities are calculated at the radius of maximum wind.[33] Characteristic values and variability on Earth On Earth  a characteristic temperature for Ts{\displaystyle T_{s}} is 300 K and for To{\displaystyle T_{o}} is 200 K  corresponding to a Carnot efficiency of \epsilon =1/3}. The ratio of the surface exchange coefficients  Ck/Cd{\displaystyle C_{k}/C_{d}}  is typically taken to be 1. However  observations suggest that the drag coefficient Cd{\displaystyle C_{d}} varies with wind speed and may decrease at high wind speeds within the boundary layer of a mature hurricane.[34] Additionally  Ck{\displaystyle C_{k}} may vary at high wind speeds due to the effect of sea spray on evaporation within the boundary layer.[35] A characteristic value of the maximum potential intensity  vp{\displaystyle v_{p}}  is 80 metres per second However  this quantity varies significantly across space and time  particularly within the seasonal cycle  spanning a range of 0 to 100 metres per second (0 to 0 to This variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium ( \Delta k} ) as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere  which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate. These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and underlying ocean dynamics)  background near-surface wind speed  and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating.[36] The nature of this modulation is complex  particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer). On shorter time-scales  variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean  as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water.[37] However  this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics of the tropics; the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on vp{\displaystyle v_{p}} is weak in comparison. Interaction with the upper ocean The passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean causes the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially  which can influence subsequent cyclone development. This cooling is primarily caused by wind-driven mixing of cold water from deeper in the ocean with the warm surface waters. This effect results in a negative feedback process that can inhibit further development or lead to weakening. Additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops (this is because the atmosphere is cooler at higher altitudes). Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean  by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.[38] Major basins and related warning centers There are six Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMCs) worldwide. These organizations are designated by the World Meteorological Organization and are responsible for tracking and issuing bulletins  warnings  and advisories about tropical cyclones in their designated areas of responsibility. In addition  there are six Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWCs) that provide information to smaller regions.[44] The RSMCs and TCWCs are not the only organizations that provide information about tropical cyclones to the public. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues advisories in all basins except the Northern Atlantic for the purposes of the United States Government.[45] The Philippine Atmospheric  Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issues advisories and names for tropical cyclones that approach the Philippines in the Northwestern Pacific to protect the life and property of its citizens.[46] The Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issues advisories on hurricanes and their remnants for Canadian citizens when they affect Canada.[47] On March 26  2004  Hurricane Catarina became the first recorded South Atlantic cyclone  striking southern Brazil with winds equivalent to on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the cyclone formed outside the authority of another warning center  Brazilian meteorologists initially treated the system as an extratropical cyclone  but later on classified it as tropical.[48] Formation Worldwide  tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer  when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest. However  each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns. On a worldwide scale  May is the least active month  while September is the most active month. November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active.[49] Times In the Northern Atlantic Ocean  a distinct cyclone season occurs from June 1 to November 30  sharply peaking from late August through September.[49] The statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is September 10. The Northeast Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity  but in a similar time frame to the Atlantic.[50] The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round  with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September.[49] In the North Indian basin  storms are most common from April to December  with peaks in May and November.[49] In the Southern Hemisphere  the tropical cyclone year begins on July 1 and runs all year-round encompassing the tropical cyclone seasons  which run from November 1 until the end of April  with peaks in mid-February to early March.[49][51]  Factors The formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood.[55] While six factors appear to be generally necessary  tropical cyclones may occasionally form without meeting all of the following conditions. In most situations  water temperatures of at least are needed down to a depth of at least waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms.[57] For tropical transitioning cyclones (i.e. Hurricane Ophelia (2017)) a water temperature of at least has been suggested.[58] Another factor is rapid cooling with height  which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone.[56] High humidity is needed  especially in the lower-to-mid troposphere; when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere  conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop.[56] Low amounts of wind shear are needed  as high shear is disruptive to the storm's circulation.[56] Tropical cyclones generally need to form more than or five degrees of latitude away from the equator  allowing the Coriolis effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low pressure center and creating a circulation.[56] Lastly  a formative tropical cyclone needs a preexisting system of disturbed weather. Tropical cyclones will not form spontaneously.[56] Low-latitude and low-level westerly wind bursts associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation can create favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis by initiating tropical disturbances.[59] Locations Most tropical cyclones form in a worldwide band of thunderstorm activity near the equator  referred to as the Intertropical Front (ITF)  the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)  or the monsoon trough.[60][61][62] Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves  which contribute to the development of about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific.[63][64][65] The majority forms between 10 and of latitude away of the equator [66] and 87% forms no farther away than north or south.[67][68] Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation  tropical cyclones rarely form or move within of the equator  where the effect is weakest.[67] However  it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004  respectively.[69][70] Movement The movement of a tropical cyclone (i.e. its "track") is typically approximated as the sum of two terms: "steering" by the background environmental wind and "beta drift".[71] Environmental steering Environmental steering is the dominant term. Conceptually  it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions  similar to "leaves carried along by a stream".[72] Physically  the winds  or flow field  in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself  and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place. In this way  tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as advection of the storm by the local environmental flow. This environmental flow is termed the "steering flow". Climatologically  tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west trade winds on the equatorial side of the subtropical persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans.[72] In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans  the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea  North America  and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out.[64] These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region.[63] In contrast  in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres  tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough.[73] Additionally  tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems  such as extratropical cyclones. Beta drift In addition to environmental steering  a tropical cyclone will tend to drift slowly poleward and westward  a motion known as "beta drift". This motion is due to the superposition of a vortex  such as a tropical cyclone  onto an environment in which the Coriolis force varies with latitude  such as on a sphere or beta plane. It is induced indirectly by the storm itself  the result of a feedback between the cyclonic flow of the storm and its environment. Physically  the cyclonic circulation of the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center. Because air must conserve its angular momentum  this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward of the storm center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs even if there is zero environmental flow. Multiple storm interaction A third component of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves the interaction of multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another  their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength  the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size  the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction  and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect  after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.[74] Interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies Though a tropical cyclone typically moves from east to west in the tropics  its track may shift poleward and eastward either as it moves west of the subtropical ridge axis or else if it interacts with the mid-latitude flow  such as the jet stream or an extratropical cyclone. This motion  termed "recurvature"  commonly occurs near the western edge of the major ocean basins  where the jet stream typically has a poleward component and extratropical cyclones are common.[75] An example of tropical cyclone recurvature was Typhoon Ioke in 2006.[76] Landfall The landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storm's surface center moves over a coastline.[9] Storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall; in fact  a tropical cyclone can launch its strongest winds over land  yet not make landfall. NOAA uses the term "direct hit" to describe when a location (on the left side of the eye) falls within the radius of maximum winds (or twice that radius if on the right side)  whether or not the hurricane's eye made landfall.[9] Dissipation Factors A tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics in several different ways. One such way is if it moves over land  thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself  quickly losing strength.[77] Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two  or evolve into extratropical cyclones. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water  such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time  weakening will accelerate.[78] Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain  when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall.[79] This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides  as was the case with Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998.[80] Without warm surface water  the storm cannot survive.[81] A tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below This will cause the storm to lose its tropical characteristics  such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center  and become a remnant low-pressure area. These remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity. This dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern North Pacific.[82] Weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear  causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center; this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone.[83] In addition  its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies  by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone  can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into extratropical cyclones. This transition can take Even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated  it can still have tropical storm force (or occasionally hurricane/typhoon force) winds and drop several inches of rainfall. In the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean  such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of North America. These phenomena can also affect Europe  where they are known as European windstorms; Hurricane Iris's extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995.[85] A cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure  becoming a larger area of low pressure. This can strengthen the resultant system  although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone.[83] Studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones.[86] Artificial dissipation In the 1960s and 1970s  the United States government attempted to weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It was thought that the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze  causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds.[87] The winds of Hurricane hurricane seeded in Project as much as 31%  but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays.[88] In an earlier episode in 1947  disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville  Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded  and smashed into Savannah  Georgia.[89] Because there was so much uncertainty about the behavior of these storms  the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within  greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes  casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today  it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.[90] Other approaches have been suggested over time  including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans.[91] Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation [92] dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice  instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop) [91] or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons.[93] Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone.[94] These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived for any of the weakening techniques to be practical.[95] Effects Tropical cyclones out at sea cause large waves  heavy rain  flood and high winds  disrupting international shipping and  at times  causing shipwrecks.[96] Tropical cyclones stir up water  leaving a cool wake behind them  which causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones.[38] On land  strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles  buildings  bridges  and other outside objects  turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The storm surge  or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone  is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones  historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.[97] The broad rotation of a landfalling tropical cyclone  and vertical wind shear at its periphery  spawns tornadoes. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices  which persist until landfall.[98] Over the past two centuries  tropical cyclones have been responsible for the deaths of about people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection  as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation.[97] Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure  leading to power outages  bridge destruction  and the hampering of reconstruction efforts.[97][99] On average  the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes  category 3 or greater. However  category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.[100] Although cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property  they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact  as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.[101] Tropical cyclones also help maintain the global heat balance by moving warm  moist tropical air to the middle latitudes and polar regions [102] and by regulating the thermohaline circulation through upwelling.[103] The storm surge and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures  but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries  which are typically important fish breeding locales. Tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment  greatly increasing local property values.[104] When hurricanes surge upon shore from the ocean  salt is introduced to many freshwater areas and raises the salinity levels too high for some habitats to withstand. Some are able to cope with the salt and recycle it back into the ocean  but others can not release the extra surface water quickly enough or do not have a large enough freshwater source to replace it. Because of this  some species of plants and vegetation die due to the excess salt.[105] In addition  hurricanes can carry toxins and acids onto shore when they make landfall. The flood water can pick up the toxins from different spills and contaminate the land that it passes over. The toxins are very harmful to the people and animals in the area  as well as the environment around them. The flooding water can also spark many dangerous oil spills.[106] Observation and forecasting Observation Intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge  as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon  and weather stations  being relatively sparse  are rarely available on the site of the storm itself. In general  surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area  or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone  where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason  there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.[107] Tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space  usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land  it can be observed by land-based Doppler weather radar. Radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes.[108] In situ measurements  in real-time  can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin  these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters.[109] The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions  both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature  humidity  pressure  and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde  a small drone aircraft  was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.[110] Forecasting Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks  accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas  and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system. The deep layer mean flow  or average wind through the depth of the troposphere  is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared  use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude  such as at the pressure surface (3 000 metres or 9 800 feet above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term wobbles of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory.[111] High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones  as well as with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors  scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.[112] However  scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones.[113] The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development. New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.[44][114][115][116][117] Classifications  terminology  and naming Intensity classifications Tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups  based on intensity: tropical depressions  tropical storms  and a third group of more intense storms  whose name depends on the region. For example  if a tropical storm in the Northwestern Pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the Beaufort scale  it is referred to as a typhoon; if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the Northeast Pacific Basin  or in the North Atlantic  it is called a hurricane.[9] Neither "hurricane" nor "typhoon" is used in either the Southern Hemisphere or the Indian Ocean. In these basins  storms of a tropical nature are referred to as either tropical cyclones  severe tropical cyclones or very intense tropical cyclones. As indicated in the table below  each basin uses a separate system of terminology  which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean  hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific  becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions  the reverse will occur.[118] It should also be noted that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s)  over 150 miles per hour  are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.[119] Tropical depression A tropical depression or tropical low is a tropical disturbance that has a clearly defined surface circulation with maximum sustained winds of less than Within the Southern Hemisphere  the depression can have gale force or stronger winds in one or more quadrants  but not near the centre.[43] Tropical storm A tropical storm is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between 34 knots and 64 knots At this point  the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop  although an eye is not usually present. Government weather services first assign names to systems that reach this intensity (thus the term named storm).[120] Although tropical storms are less intense than a hurricane they can produce significant damage. The shear force of winds can blow off shingles  and air borne objects can cause damage to power lines  roofing and siding. More dangerous is the heavy rainfall causing inland flooding.[121] Hurricane or typhoon A hurricane or typhoon (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone  as opposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least A cyclone of this intensity tends to develop an eye  an area of relative calm (and lowest atmospheric pressure) at the center of circulation. The eye is often visible in satellite images as a small  circular  cloud-free spot. Surrounding the eye is the eyewall  an area about 16 kilometres to 80 kilometres wide in which the strongest thunderstorms and winds circulate around the storm's center. Maximum sustained winds in the strongest tropical cyclones have been estimated at about Origin of storm terms The word typhoon  which is used today in the Northwest Pacific  may be derived from Arabic (similar in Hindustani and Persian)  which in turn originates from Greek Typhon  a monster from Greek mythology associated with storms.[123] The related Portuguese word  used in Portuguese for typhoons  is also derived from Typhon.[124][disputed (for: folk etymology?) discuss] The word is also similar to Chinese (Simplified Chinese:  Traditional Chinese: = wind)  "toifung" in Cantonese  in Japanese  and "taepung" in Korean. The word hurricane  used in the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific  is derived from  the Spanish word for the Carib/Taino storm god  This god is believed by scholars to have been at least partially derived from the Mayan creator god  Huracan. Huracan was believed by the Maya to have created dry land out of the turbulent waters. The god was also credited with later destroying the "wooden people"  the precursors to the "maize people"  with an immense storm and flood.[125][126] Huracan is also the source of the word orcan  another word for a particularly strong European windstorm.[126] Naming The practice of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years  with systems named after places or things they hit before the formal start of naming.[127][128] The system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems in a brief form  that is readily understood and recognized by the public.[127][128] The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907.[127][128] This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired  until it was revived in the latter part of World War II for the Western Pacific.[127][128] Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North and South Atlantic  Eastern  Central  Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.[128] At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts  watches  and warnings.[127] Since the systems can last a week or longer and more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time  the names are thought to reduce the confusion about what storm is being described.[127] Names are assigned in order from predetermined lists with one  three  or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than depending on which basin it originates.[39][41][42] However  standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific  while tropical cyclones have to have a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named within the Southern Hemisphere.[42][43] The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean  Pacific Ocean  and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name.[39][40][43] Notable tropical cyclones Tropical cyclones that cause extreme destruction are rare  although when they occur  they can cause great amounts of damage or thousands of fatalities. The 1970 Bhola cyclone is the deadliest tropical cyclone on record  killing more than 300 and potentially as many as after striking the densely populated Ganges Delta region of Bangladesh on November 13  1970. Its powerful storm surge was responsible for the high death toll.[129] The North Indian cyclone basin has historically been the deadliest basin.[97][131] Elsewhere  Typhoon Nina killed nearly 100 000 in China in 1975 due to a 100-year flood that caused including the Banqiao Dam to fail.[132] The Great Hurricane of 1780 is the deadliest North Atlantic hurricane on record  killing about 22 in the Lesser Antilles.[133] A tropical cyclone does not need to be particularly strong to cause memorable damage  primarily if the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides. Tropical Storm Thelma in November 1991 killed thousands in the Philippines [134] although the strongest typhoon to ever make landfall on record was Typhoon Haiyan on November 2013  causing widespread devastation in Eastern Visayas and killing at least 6 300 people in that country alone. In 1982  the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul killed around 1 in Central America.[135] Hurricane Harvey is estimated as the costliest tropical cyclone worldwide [136] with an estimated in damages (2017 USD). Harvey killed at least in August 2017 after making landfall in Texas as a low-end Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Katrina is estimated as the second-costliest tropical cyclone worldwide [137] causing in property damage with overall damage estimates exceeding Katrina killed at least 1 after striking Louisiana and Mississippi as a major hurricane in August 2005.[138] Hurricane Sandy is the third most destructive tropical cyclone in U.S history  with damage totaling  and with damage costs at  Hurricane Ike is the fourth most destructive tropical cyclone in U.S history. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 is the deadliest natural disaster in the United States  killing an estimated 6 000 to 12 in Galveston  Texas.[139] Hurricane Mitch caused more than 10 000 fatalities in Central America  making it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history. Hurricane Iniki in 1992 was the most powerful storm to strike Hawaii in recorded history  hitting Kauai as a hurricane  killing six people  and causing U.S. in damage.[140] Kauai was also struck by Hurricanes Dot (1959) and Iwa (1982) (see List of Hawaii hurricanes). Other destructive Eastern Pacific hurricanes include Pauline and Kenna  both causing severe damage after striking Mexico as major hurricanes.[141][142] In March 2004  Cyclone Gafilo struck northeastern Madagascar as a powerful cyclone  killing 74  affecting more than 200 000  and becoming the worst cyclone to affect the nation for more than The most intense storm on record was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979  which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots or 190 miles per hour The highest maximum sustained wind speed ever recorded was 185 knots or 215 miles per hour in Hurricane Patricia in 2015  which is the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.[145] Typhoon Nancy in 1961 also had recorded wind speeds of 185 knots or 215 miles per hour  but recent research indicates that wind speeds from the 1940s to the 1960s were gauged too high  and this is no longer considered the storm with the highest wind speeds on record.[122] Likewise  a surface-level gust caused by Typhoon Paka on Guam in late 1997 was recorded at 205 knots or 235 miles per hour Had it been confirmed  it would be the strongest non-tornadic wind ever recorded on the Earth's surface  but the reading had to be discarded since the anemometer was damaged by the storm.[146] The World Meteorological Organization established Barrow Island as the location of the highest non-tornado related wind gust at The gust occurred on 10 April 1996  during Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia and is documented in the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal.[148] In addition to being the most intense tropical cyclone on record based on pressure  Tip was the largest cyclone on record  with tropical storm-force winds 2 170 kilometres (1 in diameter. The smallest storm on record  Tropical Storm Marco  formed during October 2008  and made landfall in Veracruz. Marco generated tropical storm-force winds only 37 kilometres in diameter.[149] Hurricane John is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record  lasting in 1994. Before the advent of satellite imagery in 1961  however  many tropical cyclones were underestimated in their durations.[150] John is also the longest-tracked tropical cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere on record  which had a path of 8 (13 Cyclone Rewa of the South Pacific and Australian region cyclone seasons had one of the longest tracks observed within the Southern Hemisphere  traveling a distance of over 5 (8 during December 1993 and January 1994.[151] Changes caused by El Oscillation Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator  then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the Westerlies.[152] When the subtropical ridge position shifts due to El  so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience much fewer tropical cyclone impacts during El and neutral years. During El years  the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near which would favor the Japanese archipelago.[153] During El years  Guam's chance of a tropical cyclone impact is one-third more likely than of the long-term average.[154] The tropical Atlantic Ocean experiences depressed activity due to increased vertical wind shear across the region during El years.[155] During La years  the formation of tropical cyclones  along with the subtropical ridge position  shifts westward across the western Pacific Ocean  which increases the landfall threat to China and much greater intensity in the Philippines.[153] Long-term activity trends While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995  there is no obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about (Between 77 and 97 tropical cyclones annually). However  the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins  primarily in the Southern Hemisphere [156] while noting that a significant downward trend in tropical cyclone numbers has been identified for the region near Australia (based on high quality data and accounting for the influence of the El Oscillation).[157] In spite of that  there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. Kerry Emanuel stated  "Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past or so  corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime."[158] Atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially  as evidenced by the fact that five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization  "recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has been caused largely by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions."[159] Political scientist Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland US hurricane damage from to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade was the second most damaging among the past 11 decades  with only the decade surpassing its costs. Often in part because of the threat of hurricanes  many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore  the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes  therefore  experts regard the early data as suspect.[160] The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a cycle  also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging major hurricanes per year and lasting  and six other averaging major hurricanes per year and lasting These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout  a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by per year.[161] Although more common since 1995  few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960  including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933  a record only recently exceeded in 2005  which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of however  many intense storms formed during During the 1887 season  19 tropical storms formed  of which a record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however  many struck in the early 19th century  including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.[163] These active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960  tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one  a ship reported a voyage through the storm  or a storm hit land in a populated area.[160] Proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia.[164][165] Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD  when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by times. This millennial-scale variability has been attributed to long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High [165] which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic oscillation.[166] According to the Azores High hypothesis  an anti-phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods  a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period  more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP [167] and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past  just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.  Climate change The 2007 IPCC report noted many observed changes in the climate  including atmospheric composition  global average temperatures  ocean conditions  and others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition  the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century  and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.[168] P.J. Webster and others published in 2005 an article in Science examining the "changes in tropical cyclone number  duration  and intensity" over the past  the period when satellite data has been available. Their main finding was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north Atlantic Ocean  there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones.[169] According to 2006 studies by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere".[170] Studies published since 2008  by Kerry Emanuel from MIT  indicate that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity.[171] In an article in Nature  Kerry Emanuel stated that potential hurricane destructiveness  a measure combining hurricane strength  duration  and frequency  "is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature  reflecting well-documented climate signals  including multidecadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific  and global warming". Emanuel predicted "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century".[172] Research reported in the September 3  2008 issue of Nature found that the strongest tropical cyclones are getting stronger  in particular over the North Atlantic and Indian oceans. Wind speeds for the strongest tropical storms increased from an average of in 1981 to in 2006  while the ocean temperature  averaged globally over all the regions where tropical cyclones form  increased from to during this period.[173][174] A 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods  storm surge  and terrestrial flooding (rivers)  and projects an increase due to global warming.[175][176] Related cyclone types In addition to tropical cyclones  there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types. These kinds of cyclones  known as extratropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones  can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation.[177] An extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences  which are typical in higher latitudes. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses; although not as frequently  an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm  and from there into a tropical cyclone.[178] From space  extratropical storms have a characteristic "comma-shaped" cloud pattern.[179] Extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high seas.[180] A subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes  from the equator to Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds  they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm.[181] From an operational standpoint  a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.[182] Popular culture In popular culture  tropical cyclones have made several appearances in different types of media  including films  books  television  music  and electronic games.[183] These media often portray tropical cyclones that are either entirely fictional or based on real events.[183] For example  George Rippey Stewart's Storm  a best-seller published in 1941  is thought to have influenced meteorologists on their decision to assign female names to Pacific tropical cyclones.[128] Another example is the hurricane in The Perfect Storm  which describes the sinking of the Andrea Gail by the 1991 Perfect Storm.[184] Hypothetical hurricanes have been featured in parts of the plots of series such as The Simpsons  Invasion  Family Guy  Seinfeld  Dawson's Creek  Burn Notice and CSI: Miami.[183][185][186][187][188][189] The 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow includes several mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features fantastical "hurricane-like"  albeit non-tropical  Arctic storms.[190][191] See also Forecasting and preparation Annual seasons References External links Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers Reference  Navigation menu Personal tools Namespaces Variants Views More Search Navigation Interaction Tools Print/export In other projects Languages

1) Setup needed: I have used python 3.6.1 and Pycharm to write the code. Certain libraries
   need to be added in order to run the code.


2) Libraries used: import urllib.request      : Urllib.request library

		from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  : BeautifulSoup library

		from collections import defaultdict : Collections library

		from math import log, pow  : Math library

		import operator 
		
 - These are the libraries used in the code and would be required for successful 	       execution.

3) The .py file to be executed for the Task 1-E is pgrank_final.py

4) Top right green button to run the file.

5) make sure that the graph names are added properly in the .py file which is placed in the get_graph() function. Adding the proper graph.txt file would allow the algorithm to calculate proper pageranks.

It can be seen through the graphs that Tropical_Cyclone is a page with maybe most in-links to it. Also it could also be a reason that since it was the seed link, the pages that have been crawled are more or less related to it. Hence, the reason why tropical cyclone is one of the most in-linked topic.
	There seem to be certain links who do not have any in-links, such as Hurricane_Isidore in the G1_DFS graph. A link with many in-links is more general, hence there would be many pages that would be pointing towards it. 
But just the pages pointing to it do not matter, i.e. just the total number, since that could easily be achieved through link farms, or link spam, rather the authority of the page pointing to it also matters, hence the links with better pages pointing towards it would have a better page rank than the links having more number of pages pointing to it but with lower authority. Although it can be seen here than Tropical cyclone maybe has a lot of in-links but when the page ranks have been generated later, tropical cyclone does not make it to the top 10 pages. Hence, we could say that just by having a higher number of pages pointing to it does not guarantee a higher page rank. The page rank algorithm in Task2 is just a small example of this scenario.

1) Setup needed: I have used python 3.6.1 and Pycharm to write the code. Certain libraries
   need to be added in order to run the code for task 2.
   I have used IntelliJ in order to write the code. Lucene jar files need to be added in            order to run the code for task 1.

2) Libraries used for task2 : from math import log
			      from collections import defaultdict
			       import os
                              from collections import ChainMap
                              from collections import OrderedDict

3) - These are the libraries used in the code and would be required for successful 	       execution of task 2.

4) In order to run the code, there are certain places where the directory has to be mentioned, currently my submission consists of the directories associated with my system.
For successful execution of index.py file of task2, the directory name should be modified as necessary.

5) Top right green button to run the index.py file


6) All the necessary lucene jar files need to be imported into the project for successful execution of HW4.java file.

7) There would be certain prompts asking to enter the path where index would be created and to mention the path to get the raw files. These inputs need to be provided for successful execution fo task 1. 

8) A queries.txt file consisting of all the queries must also be provided in order to perform successful execution. I have provided with the txt used by me for the execution in my submission file. A proper directory name needs to be provided.

9) I have also provided with a map.txt consisting of the wikipedia link to the corresponding file_no.txt

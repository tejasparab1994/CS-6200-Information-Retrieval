indian ocean  contents  geographyedit the major choke points include bab el mandeb strait of hormuz the lombok strait the strait of malacca and the palk strait seas include the gulf of aden andaman sea arabian sea bay of bengal great australian bight laccadive sea gulf of mannar mozambique channel gulf of oman persian gulf red sea and other tributary water bodies the indian ocean is artificially connected to the mediterranean sea through the suez canal which is accessible via the red sea all of the indian ocean is in the eastern hemisphere and the centre of the eastern hemisphere is in this ocean marginal seasedit marginal seas gulfs bays and straits of the indian ocean include climateedit the climate north of the equator is affected by a monsoon climate strong north-east winds blow from october until april from may until october south and west winds prevail in the arabian sea the violent monsoon brings rain to the indian subcontinent in the southern hemisphere the winds are generally milder but summer storms near mauritius can be severe when the monsoon winds change cyclones sometimes strike the shores of the arabian sea and the bay of bengal oceanographyedit among the few large rivers flowing into the indian ocean are the zambezi shatt al-arab indus godavari krishna narmada ganges brahmaputra jubba and irrawaddy the ocean's currents are mainly controlled by the monsoon two large gyres one in the northern hemisphere flowing clockwise and one south of the equator moving anticlockwise including the agulhas current and agulhas return current constitute the dominant flow pattern during the winter monsoon however currents in the north are reversed precipitation and evaporation leads to salinity variation in all oceans and in the indian ocean salinity variations are driven by 1 river inflow mainly from the bay of bengal 2 fresher water from the indonesian throughflow and 3 saltier water from the red sea and persian gulf.7 surface water salinity ranges from 32 to 37 parts per 1000 the highest occurring in the arabian sea and in a belt between southern africa and south-western australia pack ice and icebergs are found throughout the year south of about 65 south latitude the average northern limit of icebergs is 45 south latitude geologyedit as the youngest of the major oceans8 the indian ocean has active spreading ridges that are part of the worldwide system of mid-ocean ridges in the indian ocean these spreading ridges meet at the rodrigues triple point with the central indian ridge including the carlsberg ridge separating the african plate from the indian plate the southwest indian ridge separating the african plate form the antarctic plate and the southeast indian ridge separating the australian plate from the antarctic plate.the central ridge runs north on the in-between across of the arabian peninsula and africa into the mediterranean sea marine lifeedit among the tropical oceans the western indian ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer due to the strong monsoon winds the monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production these phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem as the base of the marine food web and eventually the larger fish species the indian ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch.10 its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export fishing fleets from russia japan south korea and taiwan also exploit the indian ocean mainly for shrimp and tuna.11 research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem a study on the phytoplankton changes in the indian ocean indicates a decline of up to 20 in the marine phytoplankton in the indian ocean during the past six decades.12 the tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century mostly due to increased industrial fisheries with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.12 endangered marine species include the dugong seals turtles and whales.11 in 2016 uk researchers from southampton university identified six new animal species at hydrothermal vents beneath the indian ocean these new species were a hoff crab a giant peltospirid snail a whelk-like snail a limpet a scaleworm and a polychaete worm.13 historyedit first settlementsedit the world's earliest civilizations in mesopotamia beginning with sumer ancient egypt and the indian subcontinent beginning with the indus valley civilization which began along the valleys of the tigris-euphrates nile and indus rivers respectively all developed around the indian ocean civilizations soon arose in persia beginning with elam and later in southeast asia beginning with funan era of discoveryedit unlike the pacific ocean where the civilization of the polynesians reached most of the far flung islands and atolls and populated them almost all the islands archipelagos and atolls of the indian ocean were uninhabited until colonial times although there were numerous ancient civilizations in the coastal states of asia and parts of africa the maldives were the only island group in the central indian ocean region where an ancient civilization flourished.18 maldivian ships used the indian monsoon current to travel to the nearby coasts.19 from 1405 to 1433 admiral zheng he led large fleets of the ming dynasty on several treasure voyages through the indian ocean ultimately reaching the coastal countries of east africa.20 industrial eraedit the opening of the suez canal in 1869 revived european interest in the east but no nation was successful in establishing trade dominance since world war ii the united kingdom was forced to withdraw from the area to be replaced by india the ussr and the united states the last two tried to establish hegemonycitation needed by negotiating for naval base sites developing countries bordering the ocean however seek to have it made a zone of peacecitation needed so that they may use its shipping lanes freely the united kingdom and united states maintain a military base on diego garcia atoll in the middle of the indian ocean contemporary eraedit on 26 december 2004 the countries surrounding the indian ocean were hit by a tsunami caused by the 2004 indian ocean earthquake the waves resulted in more than 226000 deaths and over 1 million people were left homeless in the late 2000s the ocean evolved into a hub of pirate activity by 2013 attacks off the horn region's coast had steadily declined due to active private security and international navy patrols especially by the indian navy.21 malaysian airlines flight 370 a boeing 777 airliner with 239 persons on board disappeared on 8 march 2014 and is alleged to have crashed into the southeastern indian ocean about 2000km from the coast of southwest western australia despite an extensive search the whereabouts of the remains of the aircraft are unknown tradeedit the indian ocean provides major sea routes connecting the middle east africa and east asia with europe and the americas it carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil fields of the persian gulf and indonesia large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of saudi arabia iran india and western australia an estimated 40 of the world's offshore oil production comes from the indian ocean.11 beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries particularly india pakistan south

typhoon a typhoon differs from a cyclone or hurricane only on the basis of location.2 a hurricane is a storm that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian ocean.2 within the northwestern pacific there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year like any tropical cyclone there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while the majority of storms form between june and november a few storms do occur between december and may although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time on average the northwestern pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally like other basins they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest with some systems recurving near and east of japan the philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls with china and japan being impacted slightly less some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck china southern china has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest pacific tropical cyclone basins  contents  nomenclatureedit etymology and usageedit the term typhoon is the regional name in the northwest pacific for a severe or mature tropical cyclone3 whereas hurricane is the regional term in the northeast pacific and northern atlantic.4 elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone severe tropical cyclone or severe cyclonic storm.5 intensity classificationsedit genesisedit frequencyedit pathsedit typhoon paths follow three general directions.19 a rare few storms like hurricane john were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the eastern/central pacific and moved into the western pacific basin monitoringedit within the western pacific rsmc tokyo-typhoon center part of the japan meteorological agency has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the western pacific since 198927 and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000.10 however each national meteorological and hydrological service within the western pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country such as the joint typhoon warning center for united states agencies28 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa for interests in the island archipelago nation29 and the hong kong observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signals.30 name sourcesedit the list of names consists of entries from 17 southeast and east asian nations and the united states who have territories directly affected by typhoons the submitted names are arranged into five lists and each list is cycled with each year unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world typhoons are not named after people instead they generally refer to animals flowers astrological signs and a few personal names however pagasa retains its own naming list which does consist of human names.31 therefore a typhoon can possibly have two names storms that cross the date line from the central pacific retain their original name but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon in japan people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year.27 recordsedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

satellite in context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earth's moon satellites are used for many purposes common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known overlapping classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbit a launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane see air launch to orbit satellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control and orbit control  contents  historyedit early conceptionsedit newton's cannonball presented as a thought experiment in a treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite the first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon.56 the idea surfaced again in jules verne's the begum's fortune 1879 the us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29 december 1948 that his office was coordinating that project between the various services.8 artificial satellitesedit the first artificial satellite was sputnik 1 launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united states sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1's success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold war sputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laika.9 in may 1946 project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century.10 the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air force's project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954 the secretary of defense stated i know of no american satellite program.11 in february 1954 project rand released scientific uses for a satellite vehicle written by r.r carhart.12 this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with the scientific use of an artificial satellite by h.k kallmann and w.w kellogg.13 following pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs the army's which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civilian/navy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2 the project succeeded explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958.14 in june 1961 three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites.15 early satellites were constructed as one-off designs with growth in geosynchronous geo satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333 geo commsat launched in 1972 the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the international space station space surveillance networkedit the united states space surveillance network ssn a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earth's orbit since 1957 when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8000 man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earth's atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites i.e ~560 satellites the rest are space debris.16 the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles non-military satellite servicesedit there are three basic categories of non-military satellite services:17 fixed satellite servicesedit fixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earth's surface mobile satellite systemsedit mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systems  scientific research satellites commercial and noncommercialedit scientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data e.g remote sensing amateur ham radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric research typesedit orbit typesedit the first satellite sputnik 1 was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 145920 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricity centric classificationsedit the general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links altitude classificationsedit inclination classificationsedit eccentricity classificationsedit synchronous classificationsedit special classificationsedit pseudo-orbit classificationsedit satellite subsystemsedit the satellite's functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite one discovers two modules.17 note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy spacecraft bus or service moduleedit the bus module consists of the following subsystems structural subsystemedit the structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage telemetry subsystemedit the telemetry subsystem aka command and data handling c&dh monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control station's commands to perform equipment operation adjustments power subsystemedit thermal control subsystemedit the thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite's body e.g optical solar reflector attitude and orbit control subsystemedit the attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators reaction wheels thrusters these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directions communication payloadedit end of lifeedit when satellites reach the end of their mission this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1 launched in 1958 vanguard 1 the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of august 2009.23 launch-capable countriesedit this list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit including production of the necessary launch vehicle note many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them instead relying on foreign launch services this list does not consider those numerous countries but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously and the date this capability was first demonstrated the list includes the european space agency a multi-national state organization but does not include private consortiums attempted first launchesedit other notesedit launch capable private entitiesedit a few other private companies are capable of sub-orbital launches first satellites of countriesedit while canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space49 it was launched aboard an american rocket from an american spaceport the same goes for australia who launched first satellite involved a donated u.s redstone rocket and american support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the united kingdom.50 the first italian satellite san marco 1 launched on 15 december 1964 on a u.s scout rocket from wallops island virginia united states with an italian launch team trained by nasa.51 by similar occasions almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets attempted first satellitesedit planned first satellitesedit attacks on satellitesedit in recent timestimeframe? satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks.9495 for testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth russia the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites.96 in 2007 the chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite96 followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february 2008.97 jammingedit due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming9899 but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.100101 also it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively.citation needed satellite servicesedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation

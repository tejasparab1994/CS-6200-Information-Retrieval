annular tropical cyclone an annular tropical cyclone is a tropical cyclone that features a normal to large symmetric eye surrounded by a thick and uniform ring of intense convection often having a relative lack of discrete rainbands as a result the appearance of an annular tropical cyclone can be referred to as akin to a truck tire or doughnut.1 annular characteristics can be attained as tropical cyclones intensify however outside the processes that drive the transition from asymmetric systems to annular systems and the abnormal resistance to negative environmental factors found in storms with annular features annular tropical cyclones behave similarly to asymmetric storms most research related to annular tropical cyclones is limited to satellite imagery and aircraft reconnaissance as the conditions thought to give rise to annular characteristics normally occur over water well removed from landmasses where surface observations are possible  contents  characteristics and identificationedit an algorithm for identification of annular tropical cyclones in real-time by objective criteria has been developed and shows some power but is not yet operational.2 transition from asymmetric cyclones and necessary conditionsedit see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

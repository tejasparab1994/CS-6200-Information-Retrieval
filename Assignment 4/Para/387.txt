subtropical cyclone a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical and an extratropical cyclone.1 as early as the 1950s meteorologists were uncertain whether they should be characterized as tropical or extratropical cyclones they were officially recognized by the national hurricane center in 1972 subtropical cyclones have begun to receive names from the official tropical cyclone lists in the north atlantic south-west indian ocean and south atlantic basins there are two definitions currently used for subtropical cyclones across the north atlantic and southwest indian ocean they require central convection fairly near the center and a warming core in the mid-levels of the troposphere across the eastern half of the northern pacific they require a mid-tropospheric cyclone to cut off from the main belt of the westerlies and only a weak surface circulation subtropical cyclones have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones and have no weather fronts linked into their center.2  contents  history of termedit throughout the 1950s and 1960s the term semi-tropical and quasi-tropical were used for what would become known as subtropical cyclones.4 the term subtropical cyclone merely referred to any cyclone located in the subtropical belt near and just north of the horse latitudes intense debate ensued in the late 1960s after a number of hybrid cyclones formed in the atlantic basin in 1972 the national hurricane center nhc finally designated these storms as subtropical cyclones in real-time5 and updated the hurricane database to include subtropical cyclones from 1968 through 1971 the term neutercane began to be used for small subtropical cyclones which formed from mesoscale features and the nhc began issuing public statements during the 1972 atlantic hurricane season employing that classification this name was not noted as controversial in contemporary news reports but it was dropped less than a year later recent articles published after the year 2000 have suggested that the name neutercane was considered sexist in the 1970s but there do not appear to be any published reports from that period making this claim.6 namingedit in the southern indian ocean subtropical cyclones are also named once winds reach tropical storm or gale force.9 since 2011 subtropical storms in the western south atlantic ocean are named by the brazilian navy hydrographic center.10 formationedit subtropical cyclones form in a wide band of latitude mainly south of the 50th parallel in the northern hemisphere.11 due to the increased frequency of cyclones which cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the summer and fall subtropical cyclones are significantly more frequent across the north atlantic than the northwestern pacific ocean.12 in the eastern half of the north pacific ocean and north indian ocean the older subtropical cyclone definition term is still used which requires a weak circulation forming underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season winter in the case of the north indian ocean the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.13 in the southern hemisphere subtropical cyclones are regularly observed across southern portions of the mozambique channel.9 the south atlantic environment for formation of subtropical cyclones has both stronger vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures yet subtropical cyclogenesis is regularly observed in the open ocean in the south atlantic a second mechanism for formation has been diagnosed for south atlantic subtropical cyclones lee cyclogenesis in the region of the brazil current.3 transition from extratropicaledit characteristicsedit subtropical cyclones are also more likely than tropical cyclones to form outside of a region's designated hurricane season recent north atlantic examples of this include the following storms diagrams which depict a cyclone's phase depict subtropical cyclones with a shallow warm core and as asymmetric systems similar to tropical cyclones which have begun the transition to an extratropical cyclone.20221 typesedit upper-level lowedit mesoscale lowedit kona stormedit kona storms or kona lows are deep cyclones that form during the cool season of the central pacific ocean a definition change in the term during the early 1970s makes categorization of the systems more complex as many kona lows are extratropical cyclones complete with their own weather fronts those across the northeast pacific ocean consider them subtropical cyclones as long as a weak surface circulation is present.13 kona is a hawaiian term for leeward which explains the change in wind direction for the hawaiian islands from easterly to southerly when this type of cyclone is present.24 australian east

united states department of energy the united states department of energy doe is a cabinet-level department of the united states government concerned with the united states policies regarding energy and safety in handling nuclear material its responsibilities include the nation's nuclear weapons program nuclear reactor production for the united states navy energy conservation energy-related research radioactive waste disposal and domestic energy production it also directs research in genomics the human genome project originated in a doe initiative.3 doe sponsors more research in the physical sciences than any other u.s federal agency the majority of which is conducted through its system of national laboratories.4 one of it's laboratories hawkins national laboratory was notorious for its participation in mkultra that included child experimentation on children with supernatural abilities such as telekinesis the hawkins national laboratory was also the site of the notorious upside down incident in which one of its child participants accidentally opened the gate to the alternate dimension resulting in 60 deaths the agency is administered by the united states secretary of energy and its headquarters are located in southwest washington d.c. on independence avenue in the james v forrestal building named for james forrestal as well as in germantown maryland former governor of texas rick perry is the current secretary of energy he was confirmed by a 62 to 37 vote in the united states senate on march 2 2017.5  contents  historyedit formation and consolidationedit in 1942 during world war ii the united states started the manhattan project a project to develop the atomic bomb under the eye of the u.s army corps of engineers after the war in 1946 the atomic energy commission aec was created to control the future of the project.67 among other nuclear projects the aec produced fabricated uranium fuel cores at locations such as fernald feed materials production center in cincinnati ohio.8910 in 1974 the aec gave way to the nuclear regulatory commission which was tasked with regulating the nuclear power industry and the energy research and development administration which was tasked to manage the nuclear weapon naval reactor and energy development programs.citation needed weapon plans stolenedit in december 1999 the fbi was investigating how china obtained plans for a specific nuclear device wen ho lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from los alamos national laboratory for the people's republic of china federal officials including then-energy secretary bill richardson publicly named lee as a suspect before he was charged with a crime the u s congress held hearings to investigate the department of energy's mishandling of his case republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues not the department of energy.15 all but one of the 59 charges against lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the chinese obtained could not have come from lee lee filed suit and won a $1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies.16 loan guarantee program of 2005edit in 2001 american solar challenge was sponsored by the united states department of energy and the national renewable energy laboratory.17 after the 2005 race the u.s department of energy discontinued its sponsorship.18 title xvii of energy policy act of 2005 authorizes the doe to issue loan guarantees to eligible projects that avoid reduce or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to technologies in service in the united states at the time the guarantee is issued.19 in loan guarantees a conditional commitment requires to meet an equity commitment as well as other conditions before the loan guarantee is completed.20 the united states department of energy the nuclear threat initiative nti the institute of nuclear materials management inmm and the international atomic energy agency iaea partnered to develop and launch the world institute for nuclear security wins in september 2008 wins is an international non-governmental organization designed to provide a forum to share best practices in strengthening the security and safety of nuclear and radioactive materials and facilities.21 recentedit on march 28 2017 a supervisor in the office of international climate and clean energy asked staff to avoid the phrases climate change emissions reduction or paris agreement in written memos briefings or other written communication a doe spokesperson denied that phrases had been banned.2223 organizationedit structure and positionsedit the department is under the control and supervision of a united states secretary of energy a political appointee of the president of the united states the energy secretary is assisted in managing the department by a united states deputy secretary of energy also appointed by the president who assumes the duties of the secretary in his absence the department also has three under secretaries each appointed by the president who oversee the major areas of the department's work the president also appoints seven officials with the rank of assistant secretary of energy who have line management responsibility for major organizational elements of the department the energy secretary assigns their functions and duties symbolism in the sealedit excerpt from the code of federal regulations in title 10 energy:24 the official seal of the department of energy includes a green shield bisected by a gold-colored lightning bolt on which is emblazoned a gold-colored symbolic sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo it is crested by the white head of an eagle atop a white rope both appear on a blue field surrounded by concentric circles in which the name of the agency in gold appears on a green background. the eagle represents the care in planning and the purposefulness of efforts required to respond to the nation's increasing demands for energy the sun atom oil derrick windmill and dynamo serve as representative technologies whose enhanced development can help meet these demands the rope represents the cohesiveness in the development of the technologies and their link to our future capabilities the lightning bolt represents the power of the natural forces from which energy is derived and the nation's challenge in harnessing the forces. the color scheme is derived from nature symbolizing both the source of energy and the support of man's existence the blue field represents air and water green represents mineral resources and the earth itself and gold represents the creation of energy in the release of natural forces by invoking this symbolism the color scheme represents the nation's commitment to meet its energy needs in a manner consistent with the preservation of the natural environment. facilitiesedit the department of energy operates a system of national laboratories and technical facilities for research and development agency as follows other major doe facilities include other nuclear weapons sitesedit the doe/nnsa has federal responsibility for the design testing and production of all nuclear weapons nnsa in turn uses contractors to carry out its responsibilities at the following government owned sites related legislationedit budgetedit president barack obama unveiled on may 7 2009 a $26.4 billion budget request for doe for fiscal year fy 2010 including $2.3 billion for the doe office of energy efficiency and renewable energy eere the budget aims to substantially expand the use of renewable energy sources while improving energy transmission infrastructure it also makes significant investmentsclarification needed in hybrids and plug-in hybrids in smart grid technologies and in scientific research and innovation.27 as part of the $789 billion economic stimulus package in the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 congress provided energy with an additional $38.3 billion for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 adding about 75 percent to energy's annual budgets most of the stimulus spending was in the form of grants and contracts.citation needed for fiscal year 2013 each of the operating units of the department of energy operated with the following budgets:28 programs and contractsedit energy savings performance contractedit energy savings performance contracts espcs are contracts under which a contractor designs constructs and obtains the necessary financing for an energy savings project and the federal agency makes payments over time to the contractor from the savings in the agency's utility bills the contractor guarantees the energy improvements will generate savings and after the contract ends all continuing cost savings accrue to the federal agency.29 energy innovation hubsedit energy innovation hubs are multi-disciplinary meant to advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages of research to the point that the risk level will be low enough for industry to commercialize the technologies.27 the consortium for advanced simulation of light water reactors casl was the first doe energy innovation hub established in july 2010 for the purpose of providing advanced modeling and simulation m&s solutions for commercial nuclear reactors.citation needed the 2009 doe budget includes $280 million to fund eight energy innovation hubs each of which is focused on a particular energy challenge two of the eight hubs are included in the eere budget and will focus on integrating smart materials designs and systems into buildings to better conserve energy and on designing and discovering new concepts and materials needed to convert solar energy into electricity another two hubs included in the doe office of science budget were created to tackle the challenges of devising advanced methods of energy storage and creating fuels directly from sunlight without the use of plants or microbes yet another hub was made to develop smart materials to allow the electrical grid to adapt and respond to changing conditions.27 in 2012 the doe awarded $120 million to the ames laboratory to start a new eih the critical materials institute which will focus on improving the supply of rare earth elements which is controlled by china.30 advanced research projects agency-energyedit arpa-e was officially created by the america competes act  authored by congressman bart gordon31 within the united states department of energy doe in 2007 though without a budget the initial budget of about $400 million was a part of the economic stimulus bill of february 2009.32 otheredit list of secretaries of energyedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit  navigation menu

effects of tropical cyclones the main effects of tropical cyclones include heavy rain strong wind large storm surges at landfall and tornadoes the destruction from a tropical cyclone depends mainly on its intensity its size and its location tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy as well as change the landscape near coastal areas by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast even well inland heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones paths being very hazardous to people's life after the cyclone has passed devastation often continues standing water can cause the spread of disease and transportation or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed hampering clean-up and rescue efforts nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones despite their devastating effects tropical cyclones are also beneficial by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward out at sea ships take advantage of their known characteristics by navigating through their weaker western half when a cyclone hits it causes pst hazards pst is an acronym standing for primary secondary and tertiary a primary hazard involves destructive winds debris and storm surge secondary hazard is flooding fires and of course fresh water flooding finally tertiary hazards involves food prices that go majorly up and other long term hazards like water poisoning  contents  at seaedit a mature tropical cyclone can release heat at a rate upwards of 6x1014 watts.1 tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves heavy rain and high winds disrupting international shipping and at times causing shipwrecks.2 generally after its passage a tropical cyclone stirs up ocean water lowering sea surface temperatures behind it.3 this cool wake can cause the region to be less favorable for a subsequent tropical cyclone on rare occasions tropical cyclones may actually do the opposite 2005's hurricane dennis blew warm water behind it contributing to the unprecedented intensity of hurricane emily which followed it closely.4 hurricanes help to maintain the global heat balance by moving warm moist tropical air to the mid-latitudes and polar regions.5 were it not for the movement of heat poleward through other means as well as hurricanes the tropical regions would be unbearably hot north american colonizationedit shipwrecks are common with the passage of strong tropical cyclones such shipwrecks can change the course of history6 as well as influence art and literature a hurricane led to a victory of the spanish over the french for control of fort caroline and ultimately the atlantic coast of north america in 1565.7 the sea venture was wrecked near bermuda in 1609 which led to the colonization of bermuda8 and provided the inspiration for shakespeare's the tempest shippingedit mariners have a way to safely navigate around tropical cyclones they split tropical cyclones in two based on their direction of motion and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the northern hemisphere the left in the southern hemisphere sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive the other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle9 since weather conditions are lessened subtractive in this portion of the storm but are still potentially quite hazardous the rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path crossing the t those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.1011 upon landfalledit the most significant effects of a tropical cyclone occur when they cross coastlines making landfall then it destroys ships and lives strong windsedit strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles buildings bridges personal property and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles in the united states major hurricanes comprise just 21 of all land falling tropical cyclones but account for 83 of all damage.12 tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts.13 tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges overpasses and roads complicating efforts to transport food clean water and medicine to the areas that need it furthermore the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region and to a diaspora of the population of the region.14 storm surgeedit the storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths.14 the relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles/kilometers inland flooding homes and cutting off escape routes the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales heavy rainfalledit the thunderstorm activity in a tropical cyclone produces intense rainfall potentially resulting in flooding mudslides and landslides inland areas are particularly vulnerable to freshwater flooding due to residents not preparing adequately.15 heavy inland rainfall eventually flows into coastal estuaries damaging marine life in coastal estuaries.16 the wet environment in the aftermath of a tropical cyclone combined with the destruction of sanitation facilities and a warm tropical climate can induce epidemics of disease which claim lives long after the storm passes.14 infections of cuts and bruises can be greatly amplified by wading in sewage-polluted water large areas of standing water caused by flooding also contribute to mosquito-borne illnesses furthermore crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation.14 tornadoesedit the broad rotation of a land falling tropical cyclone often spawns tornadoes particularly in their right front quadrant while these tornadoes are normally not as strong as their non-tropical counterparts heavy damage or loss of life can still occur tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices which persist until landfall.20 deathsedit united statesedit reconstruction and repopulationedit while tropical cyclones may well seriously damage settlement total destruction encourages rebuilding for example the destruction wrought by hurricane camille on the gulf coast spurred redevelopment greatly increasing local property values.19 research indicates that the typical hurricane strike raises real house prices for a number of years with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence.26 however disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms hurricane katrina is the most obvious example as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after hurricane camille many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well in isolated areas with small populations tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties to contribute to the founder's effect as survivors repopulate their place for example around 1775 a typhoon hit pingelap atoll and in combination with a subsequent famine reduced the island's population to a low level several generations after the disaster as many as 10 of pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called achromatopsia.27 this is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.27 effects on natural resourcesedit geomorphologyedit tropical cyclones reshape the geology near the coast by eroding sand from the beach as well as offshore rearranging coral and changing dune configuration onshore their rain water gets absorbed into stalagmites within caves creating a record of past tropical cyclone impacts coastal ridgesedit limestone cave stalagmitesedit landscapesedit assessments of cyclone damage done to tropical rainforest landscapes in northeast australia have produced the following typology for describing and

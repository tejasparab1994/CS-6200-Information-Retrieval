calling sarah smiles the stand-out and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track let's kill tonight.63 alternative press also welcomed the new version of panic at the disco perhaps smith and urie's biggest success on vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008's pretty odd. wrote critic evan lucy the duo sound absolutely recharged likely a result of the lineup shuffling but also perhaps a realization that the '70s were a nice place to visit for a couple years but life in the 21st century is much more fun.54 he went on to praise the elfman-esque string arrangements creepy undertones and twinkling pianos on several tracks and enjoy the scaled-back more personal tracks such as the calendar and memories.54 james montgomery of mtv news said of the album vices is at its very core a studio album one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation which not only positions panic as perhaps this generation's brian-wilsons-on-a-budget but serves as a solid starting point for wherever urie and smith choose to go from here. he complimented the new sound of the band it's not exactly new not exactly old but it's definitely something call it a fresh start a return to form a re-imaging of the past just don't call it pretty odd because that ship has sailed panic are back to their old tricks exclamation point and all .. and perhaps that was the secret ingredient all along.64 negative criticism for the album mostly came regarding the inexperienced lyrcism of urie william goodman of spin criticized urie's lyrics of the album the result is verbose and generic diary-entry romance but praised the musical experimentation remarking vices  virtues's saving grace though is the varied instrumentation  marimbas xylophones accordion synths and digital atmospherics.61 jody rosen of rolling stone concurred with goodman and also focused positive opinion upon the arrangements of the album recommending nearly witches and calling the album emo retropop commenting it's the closest emo has come to the sound of old-school pop and rock with beach boys harmonies and even gypsy-style swing flavoring the usual hopped-up confessions.60 mikael wood of entertainment weekly agreed with these sentiments recommending the ballad of mona-lisa and the harmony-drenched sarah smiles.56 vices  virtues touredit the tour sported the same electric over-the-top theatricality the band was known for during the fever era i really miss wearing costumes and makeup urie told spin i love throwing a big production i've recently been reading about tesla coils and i'm trying to figure out how i can get one that sits on the stage and shoots sparks without hurting anybody.66 uses in mediaedit the song ready to go get me out of my mind was used as the end credit song for the 2011 film the smurfs it is also featured in three diet

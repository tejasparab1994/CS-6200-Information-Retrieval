drought a drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply whether atmospheric surface water or ground water a drought can last for months or years or may be declared after as few as 15 days.1 it can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region2 and harm to the local economy.3 annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour many plant species such as those in the family cactaceae or cacti have drought tolerance adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought some others survive dry periods as buried seeds semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands.4 prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crises most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity the most prolonged drought ever in the world in recorded history occurred in the atacama desert in chile 400 years.5  contents  causes of droughtedit precipitation deficiencyedit mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective stratiform6 and orographic rainfall.7 convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation8 while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer duration.9 precipitation can be divided into three categories based on whether it falls as liquid water liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface or ice droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are in themselves low if these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficient to reach the surface over a sufficient time the result is a drought drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems winds carrying continental rather than oceanic air masses and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region once a region is within drought feedback mechanisms such as local arid air10 hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging11 and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions dry seasonedit within the tropics distinct wet and dry seasons emerge due to the movement of the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough.12 the dry season greatly increases drought occurrence13 and is characterized by its low humidity with watering holes and rivers drying up because of the lack of these watering holes many grazing animals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water and feed to more fertile spots examples of such animals are zebras elephants14 and wildebeest because of the lack of water in the plants bushfires are common.15 since water vapor becomes more energetic with increasing temperature more water vapor is required to increase relative humidity values to 100 at higher temperatures or to get the temperature to fall to the dew point.16 periods of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable production17 increase evaporation and transpiration from plants18 and worsen drought conditions.19 erosion and human activitiesedit human activity can directly trigger exacerbating factors such as over farming excessive irrigation21 deforestation and erosion adversely impact the ability of the land to capture and hold water.22 in arid climates the main source of erosion is wind.23 erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind the wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region deflation suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion ecological succession wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.24 loess is a homogeneous typically nonstratified porous friable slightly coherent often calcareous fine-grained silty pale yellow or buff windblown aeolian sediment.25 it generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.26 loess tends to develop into highly rich soils under appropriate climatic conditions areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world.27 loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature and will erode very readily therefore windbreaks such as big trees and bushes are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.23 wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought for example in the great plains it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.28 climate changeedit activities resulting in global climate change are expected to trigger droughts with a substantial impact on agriculture2930 throughout the world and especially in developing nations.313233 overall global warming will result in increased world rainfall.34 along with drought in some areas flooding and erosion will increase in others paradoxically some proposed solutions to global warming that focus on more active techniques solar radiation management through the use of a space sunshade for one may also carry with them increased chances of drought.35 typesedit as a drought persists the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases people tend to define droughts in three main ways 36 consequences of droughtedit the effects of droughts and water shortages can be divided into three groups environmental economic and social consequences in the case of environmental effects lower surface and subterranean water levels lower flow levels with a decrease below the minimum leading to direct danger for amphibian life increased pollution of surface water the drying out of wetlands more and larger fires higher deflation intensity losing biodiversity worse health of trees and the appearance of pests and den droid diseases economic losses include lower agricultural forests game and fishing output higher food production costs lower energy production levels in hydro plants losses caused by depleted water tourism and transport revenue problems with water supply for the energy sector and technological processes in metallurgy mining the chemical paper wood foodstuff industries etc. disruption of water supplies for municipal economies meanwhile social costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon excessive heat waves possible limitation of water supplies and its increased pollution levels high food costs stress caused by failed harvests etc this is why droughts and fresh water shortages may be considered as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing countries.41 the effect varies according to vulnerability for example subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food sources areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food source are more vulnerable to famine drought can also reduce water quality4243 because lower water flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources common consequences of drought include globallyedit drought is a normal recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world it is among the earliest documented climatic events present in the epic of gilgamesh and tied to the biblical story of joseph's arrival in and the later exodus from ancient egypt.54 hunter-gatherer migrations in 9500 bc chile have been linked to the phenomenon55 as has the exodus of early humans out of africa and into the rest of the world around 135000 years ago.56 examplesedit well-known historical droughts include the darfur conflict in sudan also affecting chad was fueled by decades of drought combination of drought desertification and overpopulation are among the causes of the darfur conflict because the arab baggara nomads searching for water have to take their livestock further south to land mainly occupied by non-arab farming people.57 in 2005 parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years.6465 a 23 july 2006 article reported woods hole research center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought.6667 scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate are pushing the rainforest towards a tipping point where it would irreversibly start to die it concludes that the rainforest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate according to the wwf the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.68 protection mitigation

high-pressure area a high-pressure area high or anticyclone is a region where the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the planet is greater than its surrounding environment winds within high-pressure areas flow outward from the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement because the higher pressure compresses the column of air near the center of the area into greater density  and so greater weight compared to lower pressure lower density and lower weight of the air outside the center however because the planet is rotating underneath the atmosphere and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it the air flow from center to periphery is not direct but is twisted due to the coriolis effect or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference viewed from above this twist in wind direction is in the same direction as the rotation of the planet the strongest high-pressure areas are associated with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions these highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies many of the features of highs may be understood in context of middle or meso-scale and relatively enduring dynamics of a planet's atmospheric circulation for example massive atmospheric subsidences occur as part of the descending branches of ferrel cells and hadley cells hadley cells help form the subtropical ridge steer tropical waves and tropical cyclones across the ocean and is strongest during the summer the subtropical ridge also helps form most of the world's deserts on english-language weather maps high-pressure centers are identified by the letter h weather maps in other languages may use different letters or symbols  contents  wind circulation in the northern and southern hemispheresedit the direction of wind flow around an atmospheric high-pressure area and a low-pressure area as seen from above depends on the hemisphere high-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere low-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere the scientific terms in english used to describe the weather systems generated by highs and lows were introduced in the mid-1800s mostly by the british the scientific theories which explain the general phenomena originated about two centuries earlier the term cyclone was coined by henry piddington of the british east india company to describe the devastating storm of december 1789 in coringa india.2 a cyclone forms around a low-pressure area anticyclone the term for the kind of weather around a high-pressure area was coined in 1877 by francis galton3 to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the opposite direction of a cyclone in british english the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise making the label anticyclones a logical extension a simple rule of thumb is that for high-pressure areas where generally air flows from the center outward the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole so both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern the opposite to these two cases occurs in the case of a high these results derive from the coriolis effect that article explains in detail the physics and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding formationedit high-pressure systems form due to downward motion through the troposphere the atmospheric layer where weather occurs preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs on weather maps these areas show converging winds isotachs also known as convergence near or above the level of non-divergence which is near the 500 hpa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere and about half the atmospheric pressure at the surface.45 high-pressure systems are alternatively referred to as anticyclones on english-language weather maps high-pressure centers are identified by the letter h in english6 within the isobar with the highest pressure value on constant pressure upper level charts it is located within the highest height line contour.7 typical conditionsedit highs are frequently associated with light winds at the surface and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere in general subsidence will dry out an air mass by adiabatic or compressional heating.8 thus high pressure typically brings clear skies.9 during the day since no clouds are present to reflect sunlight there is more incoming shortwave solar radiation and temperatures rise at night the absence of clouds means that outgoing longwave radiation i.e heat energy from the surface is not absorbed giving cooler diurnal low temperatures in all seasons when surface winds become light the subsidence produced directly under a high-pressure system can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge leading to widespread haze.10 if the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight fog can form.11 strong vertically shallow high-pressure systems moving from higher latitudes to lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses.12 once arctic air moves over an unfrozen ocean the air mass modifies greatly over the warmer water and takes on the character of a maritime air mass which reduces the strength of the high-pressure system.13 when extremely cold air moves over relatively warm oceans polar lows can develop.14 however warm and moist or maritime tropical air masses that move poleward from tropical sources are slower to modify than arctic air masses.15 in climatologyedit in terms of climatology high pressure forms at the horse latitudes or torrid zone16 between the latitudes of 20 and 40 degrees from the equator as a result of air that has been uplifted at the equator as the hot air rises it cools losing moisture it is then transported poleward where it descends creating the high-pressure area.17 this is part of the hadley cell circulation and is known as the subtropical ridge or subtropical high and is strongest in the summer.18 the subtropical ridge is a warm core high-pressure system meaning it strengthens with height.19 many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure systems.20 connection to windedit wind flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.26 this is due to density differences between the two air masses since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts the stronger the pressure difference or pressure gradient between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system the stronger the wind the coriolis force caused by the earth's rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction this is known as a geostrophic wind.27 see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation

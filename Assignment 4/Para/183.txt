gulf of mexico  contents  extentedit the international hydrographic organization defines the southeast limit of the gulf of mexico as follows:5 geologyedit geologists and other earth scientists agree in general that the present gulf of mexico basin originated in late triassic time as the result of rifting within pangea.10 the rifting was associated with zones of weakness within pangea including sutures where the laurentia south american and african plates collided to create it first there was a late triassic-early jurassic phase of rifting during which rift valleys formed and filled with continental red beds second as rifting progressed through early and middle jurassic time continental crust was stretched and thinned this thinning created a broad zone of thick transitional crust which displays modest and uneven thinning with block faulting and a broad zone of uniformly thinned transitional crust which is half the typical thickness 35 kilometers of normal continental crust it was at this time that tectonics first created a connection to the pacific ocean across central mexico and later eastward to the atlantic ocean this flooded the subsiding basin created by rifting and crustal thinning to create the gulf of mexico while the gulf of mexico was a restricted basin the subsiding transitional crust was blanketed by the widespread deposition of louann salt and associated anhydrite evaporites initially during the late jurassic continued rifting widened the gulf of mexico and progressed to the point that sea-floor spreading and formation of oceanic crust occurred at this point sufficient circulation with the atlantic ocean was established that the deposition of louann salt ceased.671112 today the gulf of mexico has the following 7 main areas:14 historyedit european explorationedit although christopher columbus was credited with the discovery of the americas by europeans the ships in his four voyages never reached the gulf of mexico instead columbus sailed into the caribbean around cuba and hispaniola the first european exploration of the gulf of mexico was by amerigo vespucci in 1497 he followed the coastal land mass of central america before returning to the atlantic ocean via the straits of florida between florida and cuba in his letters vespucci described this trip and once juan de la cosa returned to spain a famous world map depicting cuba as an island was produced in 1697 pierre le moyne d'iberville sailed for france and was chosen by the minister of marine to lead an expedition to rediscover the mouth of the mississippi river and to colonize louisiana which the english coveted iberville's fleet sailed from brest on october 24 1698 on january 25 1699 iberville reached santa rosa island in front of pensacola founded by the spanish he sailed from there to mobile bay and explored massacre island later renamed dauphin island he cast anchor between cat island and ship island and on february 13 1699 he went to the mainland biloxi with his brother jean-baptiste le moyne de bienville.17 on may 1 1699 he completed a fort on the north-east side of the bay of biloxi a little to the rear of what is now ocean springs mississippi this fort was known as fort maurepas or old biloxi a few days later on may 4 pierre le moyne sailed for france leaving his teenage brother jean-baptiste le moyne as second in command to the french commandant shipwrecksedit the mardi gras shipwreck around the early-19th century about 35 miles off the coast of louisiana in 4000 feet 1220 meters of water she is believed to have been a privateer or trader the shipwreck whose real identity remains a mystery lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the okeanos gas gathering company oggc in may 2007 an expedition led by texas a&m university and funded by oggc under an agreement with the minerals management service now boem was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the louisiana state museum as part of the project educational outreach nautilus productions in partnership with boem texas a&m university the florida public archaeology network18 and veolia environmental produced a one-hour hd documentary19 about the project short videos for public viewing and provided video updates during the expedition video footage from the rov was an integral part of this outreach and used extensively in the mystery mardi gras shipwreck documentary.20 in 2001 the wreck of u-166 was located in 5000 feet 1500 m of water less than two miles from where it had attacked the robert e lee an archaeological survey of the seafloor prior to construction of a natural gas pipeline led to the discoveries by c  c marine archaeologists robert a church and daniel j warren the sonar contacts consisted of two large sections lying approximately 500 feet apart at either end of a debris field that indicated the presence of a u-boat.24 geographyedit the gulf's warm water temperature can feed powerful atlantic hurricanes causing extensive human death and other destruction as happened with hurricane katrina in 2005 in the atlantic a hurricane will draw up cool water from the depths and making it less likely that further hurricanes will follow in its wake warm water being one of the preconditions necessary for their formation however the gulf is shallower when a hurricane passes over the water temperature may drop but it soon rebounds and becomes capable of supporting another tropical storm.30 the gulf is considered aseismic however mild tremors have been recorded throughout history usually 5.0 or less on the richter magnitude scale earthquakes may be caused by interactions between sediment loading on the sea floor and adjustment by the crust.31 2006 earthquakeedit maritime boundary delimitation agreementsedit cuba and mexico exchange of notes constituting an agreement on the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone of mexico in the sector adjacent to cuban maritime areas with map of july 26 1976 cuba and united states of america maritime boundary agreement between the united states of america and the republic of cuba of december 16 1977 on december 13 2007 mexico submitted information to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf clcs regarding the extension of mexico's continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.35 mexico sought an extension of its continental shelf in the western polygon based on international law unclos and bilateral treaties with the united states in accordance with mexico's domestic legislation on march 13 2009 the clcs accepted mexico's arguments for extending its continental shelf up to 350 nm into the western polygon since this would extend mexico's continental shelf well into territory claimed by the united states however mexico and the u.s would need to enter a bilateral agreement based on international law that delimits their respective claims biotaedit various biota include chemosynthetic communities near cold seeps and nonchemosynthetic communities such as bacteria and other micro  benthos meiofauna macrofauna and megafauna larger organisms such as crabs sea pens crinoids and demersal fish and cetaceans including endangered ones are living in the gulf of mexico.36 recently resident bryde's whales within the gulf were classified as an endemic unique subspecies and making them as one of the most endangered whales in the world.37 the gulf of mexico yields more finfish shrimp and shellfish annually than the south and mid-atlantic chesapeake and new england areas combined.4 the smithsonian institution gulf of mexico holdings are expected to provide an important baseline of understanding for future scientific studies on the impact of the deepwater horizon oil spill.38 in congressional testimony dr jonathan coddington associate director of research and collections at the smithsonian's national museum of natural history provides a detailed overview of the gulf collections and their sources which museum staff have made available on an online map the samples were collected for years by the former minerals management service renamed the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement to help predict the potential impacts of future oil/gas explorations since 1979 the specimens have been deposited in the national collections of the national museum of natural history.39 pollutionedit the major environmental threats to the gulf are agricultural runoff and oil drilling there are frequent red tide algae blooms40 that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore this has especially been plaguing the southwest and southern florida coast from the florida keys to north of pasco county florida there are 27000 abandoned oil and gas wells beneath the gulf these have generally not been checked for potential environmental problems.43 ixtoc i explosion and oil spilledit in june 1979 the ixtoc i oil platform in the bay of campeche suffered a blowout leading to a catastrophic explosion which resulted in a massive oil spill that continued for nine months before the well was finally capped this was ranked as the largest oil spill in the gulf of mexico until the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010 deepwater horizon explosion and oil spilledit in july 2015 bp reached an $18.7bn settlement with the us government the states of alabama florida louisiana mississippi and texas as well as 400 local authorities to date bp's cost for the clean-up environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached $54bn.49 minor oil spillsedit according to the national response center the oil industry has thousands of minor accidents in the gulf of mexico every year.50 brutus oil spilledit on may 12 2016 a release of oil from subsea infrastructure on shell's brutus oil rig released 2100 barrels of oil this leak created a visible 2 mile by 13 mile oil slick in the sea about 97 miles south of port fourchon louisiana according to the u.s bureau of safety and environmental enforcement.50 see alsoedit us gulf of mexico protraction areas referencesedit external linksedit

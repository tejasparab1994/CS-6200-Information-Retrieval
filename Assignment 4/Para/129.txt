list of retired australian cyclone names  contents  backgroundedit within the region the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887  1907.5 wragge used names drawn from the letters of the greek alphabet greek and roman mythology and female names to describe weather systems including tropical cyclones over australia new zealand and the antarctic.5 after the new australian government had failed to create a federal weather bureau and appoint him director wragge started naming cyclones after political figures.6 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired before the australian bureau of meteorology started to use female names for tropical cyclones in the region during the 1963-64 cyclone season.5 during the international women's year of 1975 the australian science minister ordered that tropical cyclones within the australian region should carry both men's and women's names.5 this was because the minister thought that both sexes should bear the odium of the devastation caused by cyclones.5 as a result male names were added to the lists of names for both basins ahead of the 1975-76 season.57 the practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the united states weather bureau in the northern atlantic basin after hurricanes carol edna and hazel struck the northeastern united states and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year.8 initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced however it was decided at the 1969 interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired.89 several names have been removed from the pacific naming lists for various other reasons than causing a significant amount of death/destruction which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and political reasons.1011 tropical cyclone names retired in the 1960sedit there were 3 tropical cyclone names retired during the 1960s after the naming of tropical cyclones had restarted during the 1963-64 tropical cyclone season.1213 tropical cyclone names retired in the 1970sedit tropical cyclone names retired in the 1980sedit tropical cyclone names retired in the 1990sedit tropical cyclone names retired in the 2000sedit during the 2000s 23 tropical cyclone names were retired at the start of the 2008-09 season two sets of indonesian names were established for the newly established tcwc jakarta while the naming lists for the three australian tcwc's were combined the name hamish subsequently became the first name to be retired from these lists after it impacted the coast of queensland during 2008-09 the name laurence was retired after it intensified into a category 5 severe tropical cyclone twice during december 2009 and affected western australia.89 tropical cyclone names retired in the 2010sedit during the 2010s ten names have been retired because of impacts caused to either australia or various south pacific island nations including the solomon islands new caledonia and tonga at the start of the decade the name magda was retired after it made landfall on the kimberley region of western australia as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone.100 the name carlos was subsequently retired after it broke several rainfall records as it impacted darwin and north-western australia during february 2011.101 the names heidi and lua were retired after the 2011-12 season and both had impacted the pilbara region of western australia.102103 the name jasmine was also retired after the 2011-12 season and had affected the island nations of vanuatu new caledonia and tonga.104 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

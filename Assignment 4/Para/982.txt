photovoltaic system a photovoltaic system also pv system or solar power system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics it consists of an arrangement of several components including solar panels to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity a solar inverter to change the electric current from dc to ac as well as mounting cabling and other electrical accessories to set up a working system it may also use a solar tracking system to improve the system's overall performance and include an integrated battery solution as prices for storage devices are expected to decline strictly speaking a solar array only encompasses the ensemble of solar panels the visible part of the pv system and does not include all the other hardware often summarized as balance of system bos moreover pv systems convert light directly into electricity and shouldn't be confused with other technologies such as concentrated solar power or solar thermal used for heating and cooling pv systems range from small rooftop-mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts nowadays most pv systems are grid-connected while off-grid or stand-alone systems only account for a small portion of the market operating silently and without any moving parts or environmental emissions pv systems have developed from being niche market applications into a mature technology used for mainstream electricity generation a rooftop system recoups the invested energy for its manufacturing and installation within 0.7 to 2 years and produces about 95 percent of net clean renewable energy over a 30-year service lifetime.1:3023  contents  modern systemedit overviewedit a photovoltaic system converts the sun's radiation into usable electricity it comprises the solar array and the balance of system components pv systems can be categorized by various aspects such as grid-connected vs stand alone systems building-integrated vs rack-mounted systems residential vs utility systems distributed vs centralized systems rooftop vs ground-mounted systems tracking vs fixed-tilt systems and new constructed vs retrofitted systems other distinctions may include systems with microinverters vs central inverter systems using crystalline silicon vs thin-film technology and systems with modules from chinese vs european and u.s.-manufacturers grid-connectionedit scale of systemedit photovoltaic systems are generally categorized into three distinct market segments residential rooftop commercial rooftop and ground-mount utility-scale systems their capacities range from a few kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts a typical residential system is around 10 kilowatts and mounted on a sloped roof while commercial systems may reach a megawatt-scale and are generally installed on low-slope or even flat roofs although rooftop mounted systems are small and display a higher cost per watt than large utility-scale installations they account for the largest share in the market there is however a growing trend towards bigger utility-scale power plants especially in the sunbelt region of the planet.8:4319 performanceedit uncertainties in revenue over time relate mostly to the evaluation of the solar resource and to the performance of the system itself in the best of cases uncertainties are typically 4 for year-to-year climate variability 5 for solar resource estimation in a horizontal plane 3 for estimation of irradiation in the plane of the array 3 for power rating of modules 2 for losses due to dirt and soiling 1.5 for losses due to snow and 5 for other sources of error identifying and reacting to manageable losses is critical for revenue and o&m efficiency monitoring of array performance may be part of contractual agreements between the array owner the builder and the utility purchasing the energy produced.citation needed recently a method to create synthetic days using readily available weather data and verification using the open solar outdoors test field make it possible to predict photovoltaic systems performance with high degrees of accuracy.27 this method can be used to then determine loss mechanisms on a local scale  such as those from snow2829 or the effects of surface coatings e.g hydrophobic or hydrophilic on soiling or snow losses.30 although in heavy snow environments with severe ground interference can result in annual losses from snow of 30%.31 access to the internet has allowed a further improvement in energy monitoring and communication dedicated systems are available from a number of vendors for solar pv systems that use microinverters panel-level dc to ac conversion module power data is automatically provided some systems allow setting performance alerts that trigger phone/email/text warnings when limits are reached these solutions provide data for the system owner and the installer installers are able to remotely monitor multiple installations and see at-a-glance the status of their entire installed base.citation needed componentsedit a photovoltaic system for residential commercial or industrial energy supply consists of the solar array and a number of components often summarized as the balance of system bos this term is synonymous with balance of plant q.v at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balance_of_plant bos-components include power-conditioning equipment and structures for mounting typically one or more dc to ac power converters also known as inverters an energy storage device a racking system that supports the solar array electrical wiring and interconnections and mounting for other components optionally a balance of system may include any or all of the following renewable energy credit revenue-grade meter maximum power point tracker mppt battery system and charger gps solar tracker energy management software solar irradiance sensors anemometer or task-specific accessories designed to meet specialized requirements for a system owner in addition a cpv system requires optical lenses or mirrors and sometimes a cooling system the terms solar array and pv system are often incorrectly used interchangeably despite the fact that the solar array does not encompass the entire system moreover solar panel is often used as a synonym for solar module although a panel consists of a string of several modules the term solar system is also an often used misnomer for a pv system solar arrayedit conventional c-si solar cells normally wired in series are encapsulated in a solar module to protect them from the weather the module consists of a tempered glass as cover a soft and flexible encapsulant a rear backsheet made of a weathering and fire-resistant material and an aluminium frame around the outer edge electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure solar modules build a string of modules often called solar panel a solar array consists of one or many such panels.32 a photovoltaic array or solar array is a linked collection of solar panels the power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business so the modules are linked together to form an array most pv arrays use an inverter to convert the dc power produced by the modules into alternating current that can power lights motors and other loads the modules in a pv array are usually first connected in series to obtain the desired voltage the individual strings are then connected in parallel to allow the system to produce more current solar panels are typically measured under stc standard test conditions or ptc pvusa test conditions in watts.33 typical panel ratings range from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts.34 the array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings in watts kilowatts or megawatts a typical 150 watt pv module is about a square meter in size such a module may be expected to produce 0.75 kilowatt-hour kwh every day on average after taking into account the weather and the latitude for an insolation of 5 sun hours/day in the last 10 years the efficiency of average commercial wafer-based crystalline silicon modules increased from about 12 to 16 and cdte module efficiency increased from 9 to 13 during same period module output and life degraded by increased temperature allowing ambient air to flow over and if possible behind pv modules reduces this problem effective module lives are typically 25 years or more.35 the payback period for an investment in a pv solar installation varies greatly and is typically less useful than a calculation of return on investment.36 while it is typically calculated to be between 10 and 20 years the financial payback period can be far shorter with incentives.37 due to the low voltage of an individual solar cell typically ca 0.5v several cells are wired also see copper used in pv systems in series in the manufacture of a laminate the laminate is assembled into a protective weatherproof enclosure thus making a photovoltaic module or solar panel modules may then be strung together into a photovoltaic array in 2012 solar panels available for consumers can have an efficiency of up to about 17%38 while commercially available panels can go as far as 27% it has been recorded that a group from the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems have created a cell that can reach 44.7 efficiency which makes scientists hopes of reaching the 50 efficiency threshold a lot more feasible.39404142 photovoltaic cell electrical output is extremely sensitive to shading the effects of this shading are well known.434445 when even a small portion of a cell module or array is shaded while the remainder is in sunlight the output falls dramatically due to internal 'short-circuiting the electrons reversing course through the shaded portion of the p-n junction if the current drawn from the series string of cells is no greater than the current that can be produced by the shaded cell the current and so power developed by the string is limited if enough voltage is available from the rest of the cells in a string current will be forced through the cell by breaking down the junction in the shaded portion this breakdown voltage in common cells is between 10 and 30 volts instead of adding to the power produced by the panel the shaded cell absorbs power turning it into heat since the reverse voltage of a shaded cell is much greater than the forward voltage of an illuminated cell one shaded cell can absorb the power of many other cells in the string disproportionately affecting panel output for example a shaded cell may drop 8 volts instead of adding 0.5 volts at a particular current level thereby absorbing the power produced by 16 other cells.46 it is thus important that a pv installation is not shaded by trees or other obstructions several methods have been developed to determine shading losses from trees to pv systems over both large regions using lidar47 but also at an individual system level using sketchup.48 most modules have bypass diodes between each cell or string of cells that minimize the effects of shading and only lose the power of the shaded portion of the array the main job of the bypass diode is to eliminate hot spots that form on cells that can cause further damage to the array and cause fires sunlight can be absorbed by dust snow or other impurities at the surface of the module this can reduce the light that strikes the cells in general these losses aggregated over the year are small even for locations in canada.28 maintaining a clean module surface will increase output performance over the life of the module google found that cleaning the flat mounted solar panels after 15 months increased their output by almost 100% but that the 5 tilted arrays were adequately cleaned by rainwater.2949 mountingedit modules are assembled into arrays on some kind of mounting system which may be classified as ground mount roof mount or pole mount for solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground and the modules mounted on the rack for buildings many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs for flat roofs racks bins and building integrated solutions are used.citation needed solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving see trackers below side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top such as a light fixture or an antenna pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside which increases performance a multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure a rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down cablingedit due to their outdoor usage solar cables are specifically designed to be resistant against uv radiation and extremely high temperature fluctuations and are generally unaffected by the weather a number of standards specify the usage of electrical wiring in pv systems such as the iec 60364 by the international electrotechnical commission in section 712 solar photovoltaic pv power supply systems the british standard bs 7671 incorporating regulations relating to microgeneration and photovoltaic systems and the us ul4703 standard in subject 4703 photovoltaic wire trackeredit for large systems the energy gained by using tracking systems can outweigh the added complexity trackers can increase efficiency by 30 or more for very large systems the added maintenance of tracking is a substantial detriment.65 tracking is not required for flat panel and low-concentration photovoltaic systems for high-concentration photovoltaic systems dual axis tracking is a necessity.66 pricing trends affect the balance between adding more stationary solar panels versus having fewer panels that track when solar panel prices drop trackers become a less attractive option inverteredit systems designed to deliver alternating current ac such as grid-connected applications need an inverter to convert the direct current dc from the solar modules to ac grid connected inverters must supply ac electricity in sinusoidal form synchronized to the grid frequency limit feed in voltage to no higher than the grid voltage and disconnect from the grid if the grid voltage is turned off.67 islanding inverters need only produce regulated voltages and frequencies in a sinusoidal waveshape as no synchronisation or co-ordination with grid supplies is required maximum power point tracking mppt is a technique that grid connected inverters use to get the maximum possible power from the photovoltaic array in order to do so the inverter's mppt system digitally samples the solar array's ever changing power output and applies the proper resistance to find the optimal maximum power point.71 anti-islanding is a protection mechanism that immediately shuts down the inverter preventing it from generating ac power when the connection to the load no longer exists this happens for example in the case of a blackout without this protection the supply line would become an island with power surrounded by a sea of unpowered lines as the solar array continues to deliver dc power during the power outage islanding is a hazard to utility workers who may not realize that an ac circuit is still powered and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices.72 batteryedit although still expensive pv systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night batteries used for grid-storage also stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads and play an important role in a smart grid as they can charge during periods of low demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is high pv systems with an integrated battery solution also need a charge controller as the varying voltage and current from the solar array requires constant adjustment to prevent damage from overcharging.74 basic charge controllers may simply turn the pv panels on and off or may meter out pulses of energy as needed a strategy called pwm or pulse-width modulation more advanced charge controllers will incorporate mppt logic into their battery charging algorithms charge controllers may also divert energy to some purpose other than battery charging rather than simply shut off the free pv energy when not needed a user may choose to heat air or water once the battery is full monitoring and meteringedit the metering must be able to accumulate energy units in both directions or two meters must be used many meters accumulate bidirectionally some systems use two meters but a unidirectional meter with detent will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid.75 in some countries for installations over 30 kwp a frequency and a voltage monitor with disconnection of all phases is required this is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility and the excess can not either be exported or stored grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity now they need to also provide storage this is normally hydro-storage but other means of storage are used initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output with variable renewable energy storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available and consumption whenever it is needed the two variables a grid operator have are storing electricity for when it is needed or transmitting it to where it is needed if both of those fail installations over 30kwp can automatically shut down although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power and results in a substantial loss of revenue.76 three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements.77 photovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize their operation there are several photovoltaic monitoring strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature monitoring can be performed on site or remotely it can measure production only retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment probes meters etc. monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software.78 energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes a third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters using the inverter manufacturer's protocols and also acquire weather-related information independent smart meters may measure the total energy production of a pv array system separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar radiation meter a pyranometer can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison.79 data collected from a monitoring system can be displayed remotely over the world wide web such as osotf.80818283 other systemsedit this section includes systems that are either highly specialized and uncommon or still an emerging new technology with limited significance however standalone or off-grid systems take a special place they were the most common type of systems during the 1980s and 1990s when pv technology was still very expensive and a pure niche market of small scale applications only in places where no electrical grid was available they were economically viable although new stand-alone systems are still being deployed all around the world their contribution to the overall installed photovoltaic capacity is decreasing in europe off-grid systems account for 1 percent of installed capacity in the united states they account for about 10 percent off-grid systems are still common in australia and south korea and in many developing countries.8:14 cpvedit concentrator photovoltaics cpv and high concentrator photovoltaic hcpv systems use optical lenses or curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small but highly efficient solar cells besides concentrating optics cpv systems sometime use solar trackers and cooling systems and are more expensive cpv is often confused with csp concentrated solar power that does not use photovoltaics both technologies favor locations that receive much sunlight and are directly competing with each other hybridedit a hybrid system combines pv with other forms of generation usually a diesel generator biogas is also used the other form of generation may be a type able to modulate power output as a function of demand however more than one renewable form of energy may be used e.g wind the photovoltaic power generation serves to reduce the consumption of non renewable fuel hybrid systems are most often found on islands pellworm island in germany and kythnos island in greece are notable examples both are combined with wind.8485 the kythnos plant has reduced diesel consumption by 11.2%.86 in 2015 a case-study conducted in seven countries concluded that in all cases generating costs can be reduced by hybridising mini-grids and isolated grids however financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant while cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant the study also identified economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities such as independent power producers.8788 there has also been recent work showing that the pv penetration limit can be increased by deploying a distributed network of pv+chp hybrid systems in the u.s.89 the temporal distribution of solar flux electrical and heating requirements for representative u.s single family residences were analyzed and the results clearly show that hybridizing chp with pv can enable additional pv deployment above what is possible with a conventional centralized electric generation system this theory was reconfirmed with numerical simulations using per second solar flux data to determine that the necessary battery backup to provide for such a hybrid system is possible with relatively small and inexpensive battery systems.90 in addition large pv+chp systems are possible for institutional buildings which again provide back up for intermittent pv and reduce chp runtime.91 floating solar arraysedit floating solar arrays are pv systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds these systems are called floatovoltaics when used only for electrical production or aquavoltaics when such systems are used to synergistically enhance aquaculture.95 a small number of such systems exist in france india japan south korea the united kingdom singapore and the united states.96979899100 the systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land the cost of land is more expensive and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation unlike most land-based solar plants floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view they achieve higher efficiencies than pv panels on land because water cools the panels the panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion.101 direct current gridedit  standaloneedit a stand-alone or off-grid system is not connected to the electrical grid standalone systems vary widely in size and application from wristwatches or calculators to remote buildings or spacecraft if the load is to be supplied independently of solar insolation the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery in non-portable applications where weight is not an issue such as in buildings lead acid batteries are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse a charge controller may be incorporated in the system to avoid battery damage by excessive charging or discharging it may also help to optimize production from the solar array using a maximum power point tracking technique mppt however in simple pv systems where the pv module voltage is matched to the battery voltage the use of mppt electronics is generally considered unnecessary since the battery voltage is stable enough to provide near-maximum power collection from the pv module in small devices e.g calculators parking meters only direct current dc is consumed in larger systems e.g buildings remote water pumps ac is usually required to convert the dc from the modules or batteries into ac an inverter is used in agricultural settings the array may be used to directly power dc pumps without the need for an inverter in remote settings such as mountainous areas islands or other places where a power grid is unavailable solar arrays can be used as the sole source of electricity usually by charging a storage battery stand-alone systems closely

shared bicycles budapest hungary costs and economyedit the cost of producing photovotaic cells have dropped due to economies of scale in production and technological advances in manufacturing for large-scale installations prices below $1.00 per watt were common by 2012.126 a price decrease of 50 had been achieved in europe from 2006 to 2011 and there is a potential to lower the generation cost by 50 by 2020.127 crystal silicon solar cells have largely been replaced by less expensive multicrystalline silicon solar cells and thin film silicon solar cells have also been developed recently at lower costs of production although they are reduced in energy conversion efficiency from single crystalline siwafers they are also much easier to produce at comparably lower costs.128 the table below shows the total cost in us cents per kwh of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system.129130 the row headings on the left show the total cost per peak kilowatt kwp of a photovoltaic installation photovoltaic system costs have been declining and in germany for example were reported to have fallen to usd 1389/kwp by the end of 2014.131 the column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kwh expected from each installed kwp this varies by geographic region because the average insolation depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight it also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon panels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing solar declination solar tracking can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight thereby raising the total energy output the calculated values in the table reflect the total cost in cents per kwh produced they assume a 10 total capital cost for instance 4 interest rate 1 operating and maintenance cost132 and depreciation of the capital outlay over 20 years normally photovoltaic modules have a 25-year warranty.133134 notes system cost 2013edit in its 2014 edition of the technology roadmap solar photovoltaic energy report the international energy agency iea published prices in us per watt for residential commercial and utility-scale pv systems for eight major markets in 2013.7 regulationedit standardizationedit increasing use of photovoltaic systems and integration of photovoltaic power into existing structures and techniques of supply and distribution increases the value of general standards and definitions for photovoltaic components and systems.citation needed the standards are compiled at the international electrotechnical commission iec and apply to efficiency durability and safety of cells modules simulation programs plug connectors and cables mounting systems overall efficiency of inverters etc.136 planning and permitedit while article 690 of the national electric code provides general guidelines for the installation of photovoltaic systems these guidelines may be superseded by local laws and regulations often a permit is required necessitating plan submissions and structural calculations before work may begin additionally many locales require the work to be performed under the guidance of a licensed electrician check with the local city/county ahj authority having jurisdiction to ensure compliance with any applicable laws or regulations in the united states the authority having jurisdiction ahj will review designs and issue permits before construction can lawfully begin electrical installation practices must comply with standards set forth within the national electrical code nec and be inspected by the ahj to ensure compliance with building code electrical code and fire safety code jurisdictions may require that equipment has been tested certified listed and labeled by at least one of the nationally recognized testing laboratories nrtl despite the complicated installation process a recent list of solar contractors shows a majority of installation companies were founded since 2000.137 national regulationsedit in the uk pv installations are generally considered permitted development and don't require planning permission if the property is listed or in a designated area national park area of outstanding natural beauty site of special scientific interest or norfolk broads then planning permission is required.138 in the us many localities require a permit to install a photovoltaic system a grid-tied system normally requires a licensed electrician to make the connection between the system and the grid-connected wiring of the building.139 installers who meet these qualifications are located in almost every state.137 the state of california prohibits homeowners associations from restricting solar devices.140 although spain generates around 40 of its electricity via photovoltaic and other renewable energy sources and cities such as huelva and seville boast nearly 3000 hours of sunshine per year spain has issued a solar tax to account for the debt created by the investment done by the spanish government those who do not connect to the grid can face up to a fine of 30 million euros $40 million usd.141142 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other

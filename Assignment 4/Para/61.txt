hail hail is a form of solid precipitation it is distinct from ice pellets american sleet though the two are often confused.1 it consists of balls or irregular lumps of ice each of which is called a hailstone ice pellets american sleet falls generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures.2 there are methods available to detect hail-producing thunderstorms using weather satellites and weather radar imagery hailstones generally fall at higher speeds as they grow in size though complicating factors such as melting friction with air wind and interaction with rain and other hailstones can slow their descent through earth's atmosphere severe weather warnings are issued for hail when the stones reach a damaging size as it can cause serious damage to human-made structures and most commonly farmers crops  contents  definitionedit formationedit layer nature of the hailstonesedit like other precipitation in cumulonimbus clouds hail begins as water droplets as the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei a cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure this means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers alternating with layers that are thin white and opaque former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted this up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone new research based on theory as well as field study has shown this is not necessarily true thus a unique trajectory in the thunderstorm is sufficient to explain the layer-like structure of the hailstone the only case in which multiple trajectories can be discussed is in a multicellular thunderstorm where the hailstone may be ejected from the top of the mother cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense daughter cell this however is an exceptional case.12 factors favoring hailedit climatologyedit hail occurs most frequently within continental interiors at mid-latitudes and is less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes.18 hail is also much more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards known as orographic lifting thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely.19 the higher elevations also result in there being less time available for hail to melt before reaching the ground one of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern india which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888.20 china also experiences significant hailstorms.21 central europe and southern australia also experience a lot of hailstorms popular regions for hailstorms are southern and western germany northern and eastern france and southern and eastern benelux in south-eastern europe croatia and serbia experience frequent occurrences of hail.22 in north america hail is most common in the area where colorado nebraska and wyoming meet known as hail alley.23 hail in this region occurs between the months of march and october during the afternoon and evening hours with the bulk of the occurrences from may through september cheyenne wyoming is north america's most hail-prone city with an average of nine to ten hailstorms per season.24 to the north of this area and also just downwind of the rocky mountains is the hailstorm alley region of alberta which also experiences an increased incidence of significant hail events short-term detectionedit weather radar is a very useful tool to detect the presence of hail-producing thunderstorms however radar data has to be complemented by a knowledge of current atmospheric conditions which can allow one to determine if the current atmosphere is conducive to hail development modern radar scans many angles around the site reflectivity values at multiple angles above ground level in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels summing reflectivities in the vertically integrated liquid or vil gives the liquid water content in the cloud research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm is related to the evolution of vil vil divided by the vertical extent of the storm called vil density has a relationship with hail size although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate.25 traditionally hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground certain patterns of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well the three body scatter spike is an example this is the result of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar the energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path forming a cone of weaker reflectivities more recently the polarization properties of weather radar returns have been analyzed to differentiate between hail and heavy rain.2627 the use of differential reflectivity zdrdisplaystyle z_dr in combination with horizontal reflectivity zhdisplaystyle z_h has led to a variety of hail classification algorithms.28 visible satellite imagery is beginning to be used to detect hail but false alarm rates remain high using this method.29 size and terminal velocityedit hail recordsedit megacryometeors large rocks of ice that are not associated with thunderstorms are not officially recognized by the world meteorological organization as hail which are aggregations of ice associated with thunderstorms and therefore records of extreme characteristics of megacryometeors are not given as hail records hazardsedit hail can cause serious damage notably to automobiles aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures livestock and most commonly farmers crops.24 hail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen such as leaks or cracks it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems.40 metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings.41 accumulationsedit

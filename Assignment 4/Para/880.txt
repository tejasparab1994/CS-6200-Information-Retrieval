experienceedit soyuz tm-19edit sts-106edit malenchenko served as a mission specialist for sts-106.7 space shuttle atlantis lifted off from the kennedy space center ksc on september 8 2000 on flight day two atlantis completed a successful rendezvous and docking with the iss the objectives of the mission were to bring supplies to the international space station iss and to prepare the zvezda service module for the arrival of the first resident crew during the 12-day mission the shuttle crew spent a week inside the iss unloading supplies from both a double spacehab cargo module in the rear of atlantis's cargo bay and from progress m1-3 which was docked to the aft docking port of zvezda after circling the globe for 186 orbits atlantis landed on september 19 2000 at runway 15 ksc the mission lasted 11 days 19 hours and 12 minutes expedition 7edit malenchenko with astronaut edward lu lifted on board the soyuz tma-2 spacecraft from the baikonur cosmodrome on april 26 2003 to the iss the spacecraft docked with the iss on april 28 2003 malenchenko served as the soyuz commander and after docking with the iss they exchanged with the resident crew on board iss and became the seventh station crew expedition 7.8 he was the commander of the expedition 7 and during his stay on the station malenchenko became the first person to get married in space soyuz tma-2 returned to earth on october 28 with both the expedition 7 crew as well as pedro duque on board the spacecraft landed at 02:40 utc near arkalyk aboard soyuz tma-2 and the iss malenchenko spent 184 days 22 hours and 46 minutes in space expedition 16edit he accumulated 191 days 19 hours and 8 minutes time in space during soyuz tma-11 and iss expedition 16 missions expedition 32/33edit spacewalksedit malenchenko conducted his first and second career spacewalks during the mir-16 mission he and musabayev performed two spacewalks on september 9 1994 5h 06m and september 14 1994 in which the station's external insulation was repaired the first and second spacewalks lasted 5 hours and 6 minutes and 6 hours and 1 minute respectively malenchenko performed his third career spacewalk during the sts-106 mission to the iss.11 on flight day three malenchenko and nasa astronaut ed lu conducted a 6-hour and 14 minute space walk the spacewalk started at 04:55 gmt on september 11 when the two spacewalkers exited the shuttle's airlock.12 the spacewalk's objective focused on routing and connecting nine power data and communications cables between the zvezda module and the zarya module as well as installing the six-foot-long magnetometer to the iss to serve as a compass showing the space station in respect to the earth this spacewalk marked the sixth spacewalk in support of the iss assembly and the 50th spacewalk in space shuttle history.13 on november 9 2007 malenchenko performed his fourth career spacewalk.14 he and expedition 16 commander peggy whitson in us emus ventured into space from the station's quest airlock at 09:54 utc.15 malenchenko's suit was all white and the purpose of the spacewalk was to prepare for the relocation of pressurized mating adapter pma-2 and the subsequent move of the harmony node to its permanent location as the first task the two spacewalkers disconnected the station to shuttle power transfer system sspts cables between the destiny laboratory and pma-2 next they disconnected eight other cables between pma-2 and the destiny malenchenko removed and replaced a failed electrical circuit box and together with whitson removed the active common berthing mechanism cover that was located at the outboard end of harmony next malenchenko moved back behind the z1 truss to reconfigure a power system removing an electrical jumper the spacewalk ended at 16.49 utc when the two spacewalkers returned to the iss the spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 55 minutes on 20 august 2012 malenchenko together with cosmonaut gennady padalka participated in his fifth career spacewalk.16 tasks assigned to the two cosmonauts included hardware relocations installations retrievals and deployments for the spacewalk malenchenko donned an orlan spacesuit with the blue stripe the duration of the spacewalk was 5 hours and 51 minutes the spacewalk was delayed for about an hour due to a small leak between space station modules the spacewalk started from the pirs docking compartment module at 15:37 gmt the first task for padalka and malenchenko was to relocate the strela-2 boom from the pirs module to the forward end of the zarya module the relocation was needed since pirs module will be detached from the space station in the future for the arrival of the new multi-purpose laboratory module mlm nauka the next task completed by padalka and malenchenko was to deploy a 21-inch diameter spherical satellite the two cosmonauts also retrieved five debris shields from the pirs module prior to installing them on the zvezda module they also completed several get-ahead tasks since the both opted not to take rests during the night passes as the duo were about an hour ahead of the timeline they retrieved an external experiment called biorisk from the pirs module for return to earth and for added stability installed two structural support struts between the pirs module and the eva ladder padalka and malenchenko then both ingress the pirs module prior to closing the hatch and beginning the re-pressurisation procedure to end a highly successful spacewalk expedition 46/47edit malenchenko arrived at the iss soyuz tma-19m to join the expedition 46 crew he performed a manual docking due to a malfunction in the automatic docking system progress ms-1 was then scheduled for launch to the iss atop a soyuz 2.1a on 21 december planned for a launch date of no earlier than 7 february 201617 the spacex crs-8 mission provided the iss with the bigelow expandable activity module two evas were performed during expedition 46.18 he returned to earth on soyuz tma-19m and landed on 18 june 2016 09:15 utc19 after spending additional 186 days in space.20 referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

bar unit the bar and the millibar were introduced by the norwegian meteorologist vilhelm bjerknes who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting.3 use of the bar is deprecated by professional bodies in some fields the international bureau of weights and measures bipm lists the bar as one of the non-si units that authors should have the freedom to use but declines to include it among the non-si units accepted for use with the si.1 the us national institute of standards and technology nist deprecates its use except for limited use in meteorology and lists it as one of several units that must not be introduced in fields where they are not presently used.4 the international astronomical union iau also lists it under non-si units and symbols whose continued use is deprecated.5 as of 2004 the bar is legally recognized in countries of the european union.2 units derived from the bar include the megabar symbol mbar kilobar symbol kbar decibar symbol dbar centibar symbol cbar and millibar symbol mbar or mb the notation barg though deprecated by various bodies2 represents gauge pressure i.e. pressure in bars above ambient or atmospheric pressure  contents  definition and conversionedit and 1 bar is approximately equal to notes originedit usageedit many engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because in much of their work using pascals would involve using very large numbers engineers that specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities would be expected to exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bar or bars a bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapor cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studies in the automotive field turbocharger boost is often described in bars outside the usa tire pressure is often specified in bar bara and bara are sometimes used to indicate absolute pressures and barg and barg for gauge pressures this usage is deprecated and fuller descriptions such as gauge pressure of 2 bar or 2 bar gauge are recommended.210 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

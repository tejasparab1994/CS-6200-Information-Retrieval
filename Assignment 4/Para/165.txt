joule in terms firstly of base si units and then in terms of other si units where kg is the kilogram m is the metre s is the second n is the newton pa is the pascal w is the watt c is the coulomb and v is the volt one joule can also be defined as  contents  usageedit confusion with newton metreedit in mechanics the concept of force in some direction has a close analog in the concept of torque about some angle the distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar  the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement by contrast torque is a vector  the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector torque and energy are related to one another by the equation practical examplesedit one joule in everyday life represents approximately multiplesedit zeptojouleedit nanojouleedit microjouleedit millijouleedit kilojouleedit the kilojoule kj is equal to one thousand 103 joules nutritional food labels in most countries express energy in kilojoules kj.11 one square metre of the earth receives about 1.4 kilojoules of solar radiation every second in full daylight.12 megajouleedit one kilowatt hour of electricity is 3.6 megajoules gigajouleedit terajouleedit petajouleedit exajouleedit zettajouleedit the zettajoule zj is equal to one sextillion 1021 joules the human annual global energy consumption is approximately 0.5 zj yottajouleedit conversionsedit 1 joule is equal to units defined exactly in terms of the joule include see alsoedit notes and referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

departed early to avoid the hurricane.21 local insurance companies on bermuda experienced a great increase in business as residents renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck.23 the arrival of fabian forced the cancellation or delay of several sports events including a cricket match a

several landmark buildings including the house of assembly and the city hall22 both in hamilton and the former military headquarters in st george's the storm surge from the hurricane stranded one vehicle with three police officers and another with a resident on the causeway between st george's parish and st david's island after a fire truck failed in its attempt to rescue them powerful waves washed the vehicles into castle harbour the united states coast guard and bermuda police divers mounted a full-scale search for the missing people during the worst of the storm the strong winds and emotional issues of searching for colleagues made the search difficult.43 ultimately the vehicles22 and one dead body were recovered17 with the others remaining missing presumably dead.22 another vehicle was on the causeway as the two cars became stranded though the driver was able to safely cross.43 high winds and surf tore off the causeway's side walls and greatly damaged the structure22 temporarily closing it to automobile traffic.30 atlantic coastedit aftermathedit initially the time for the destroyed vegetation on bermuda to regrow was estimated to take decades to help the south carolina maritime heritage foundation with support from a boy scout troop and nearby nurseries delivered 1000 boxwood plants to the island.40 following the damage to the bermuda petrel's habitat bermuda's department of conservation carried out a translocation program which involved moving the habitat to nonsuch island that island a long-standing nature preserve was much higher and safer for the birds and by two years after the hurricane the population numbers were higher than before the storm.52 shortly after the hurricane the american home improvement franchise this old house unaware of the limited extent of damage decided to do a hurricane repair story upon realising that there would be little to nothing available for the ask this old house to repair it was decided instead to do a renovation of an 1805 home in st george's it was only the second time that the franchise had worked outside of the united states.53 a memorial to the four bermudians whose lives were claimed by hurricane fabian was subsequently erected near the causeway's east end by the airport where the 10th anniversary of their deaths was remembered by government officials in september 2013.54 the onslaught of hurricane gonzalo in october 2014 prompted a catastrophe modeller to revisit fabian's destruction concluding that had it struck in 2014 it would have caused around $650 million in damage.55 retirementedit due to the damage and deaths on bermuda the name fabian was retired in the spring of 2004 and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane as a result the bermuda weather service allowed residents to suggest a replacement name with the only rule being the name had to be a male name beginning with the letter f able to be easily pronounced and not currently in use the service received a list of over 30 names including forrest and frodo after the character in the lord of the rings.56 the bermuda weather service sent three names to the world meteorological organization fred ford and flynn.57 the world meteorological organization ultimately replaced fabian with fred to be on the list for the 2009 season.25 fabian is one of only two tropical cyclones to have its name retired without making landfall anywhere with the other being klaus in 1990 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more

hurdat the national hurricane centers hurricane databases hurdat are two separate databases that contain details on tropical cyclones that have occurred within the atlantic ocean and eastern pacific ocean since either 1851 or 1949 the eastern pacific database was originally compiled at the nhc during 1976 to help with the initialization with two tropical cyclone forecast models initially tracks for the central pacific region and tracks for tropical depressions that did not develop into tropical storms or hurricanes were not included within the database over the next few years tracks were archived best track data from the eastern pacific hurricane center ephc were archived by the nhc on an annual basis during 1982 the nhc started to include data on central pacific tropical storms and hurricanes within the database before they took over the responsibility for issuing advisories during 1988 the format of the eastern pacific database was subsequently significantly changed during 2013 to include non-synoptic best track times and non-developing tropical depressions  contents  the atlantic hurricane databaseedit during the 1990s jose fernandez-partagas led efforts to document previously undocumented tropical cyclones from the mid 1800s until the early 1900s by using lists of previous hurricanes books and newspapers.78 after his death in 1997 the results of his efforts were built upon by the atlantic reanalysis team before being checked by nhc's best track committee and added in to the atlantic hurdat in 2001 and 2003.91011 in 2013 the archives format was significantly changed to include non-synoptic best track times non-developing tropical depressions and wind radii.12 the eastern and central pacific hurricane databaseedit the eastern pacific best track database was initially compiled on magnetic tape in 1976 for the seasons between 1949 and 1975 at the nhc to help with the development of two tropical cyclone forecast models which required tracks of past cyclones as a base for its predictions.1314 the database was based on records held by the united states navy and were interpolated from 12 hourly intervals to 6 hourly intervals based on a scheme devised by hiroshi akima in 1970.1516 initially tracks for the central pacific region and tracks for tropical depressions that did not develop into tropical storms or hurricanes were not included within the database.16 after the database had been created arthur pike of the nhc made some internal adjustments while in 1980 a review was made by arnold court under contract from the united states national weather service and resulted in additions and/or modifications to 81 tracks in the database.1517 between 1976  1987 the nhc archived best track data from the eastern pacific hurricane center ephc and in 1982 started including information on central pacific tropical storms and hurricanes started to be included in the database based on data from the joint typhoon warning center and research done by samuel shaw of the central pacific hurricane center cphc in 1981.1315 the format of the database was completely revised by the nhc during 1984 so that the format could resemble the atlantic database before they took over the warning responsibility from the ephc for the eastern pacific during 1988.151718 during 2008 and 2013 several revisions were made to the database to extend tracks in land based on reports in the mariners weather log and extrapolation of the tracks since the ephc stopped issuing advisories on systems before they made landfall.19 the archives format was significantly changed during 2013 to include non-synoptic best track times non-developing tropical depressions and wind radii.20 during february 2016 the nhc released the 1959 mexico hurricane's reanalysis which was the first system to be reassessed using methods developed for the atlantic reanalysis process.21 reanalysis projectsedit after the hurdat databases were created it became obvious over the next couple of decades that hurdat needed to be revised because it was incomplete contained significant errors or did not reflect the latest scientific understanding regarding the interpretation of past data.22 in 2013 the archives format was significantly changed to include non-synoptic best track times non-developing tropical depressions and wind radii.12 during march 2014 the atlantic hurdat was updated with the results of the reanalysis for the seasons between 1946 and 1950 with nine tropical storms added to the database.2324 hurricane camille's reanalysis was expedited and published during april 2014 after the national hurricane center management realised a need to answer the question which is the strongest hurricane to have struck the united states?2526 during 2015 and 2016 hurdat was revised with the results of the reanalysis for the seasons between 1951 and 1955 with 12 new tropical storms added to the database.2327 referencesedit navigation menu

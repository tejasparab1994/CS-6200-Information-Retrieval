enthalpy of vaporization the heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for reduced temperaturetrdisplaystyle t_r1displaystyle ll 1 the heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at a certain point called the critical temperature tr1displaystyle t_r=1 above the critical temperature the liquid and vapor phases are indistinguishable and the substance is called a supercritical fluid  contents  unitsedit values are usually quoted in j/mol or kj/mol molar enthalpy of vaporization although kj/kg or j/g specific heat of vaporization and older units like kcal/mol cal/g and btu/lb are sometimes still used among others enthalpy of condensationedit the enthalpy of condensation or heat of condensation is by definition equal to the enthalpy of vaporization with the opposite sign enthalpy changes of vaporization are always positive heat is absorbed by the substance whereas enthalpy changes of condensation are always negative heat is released by the substance thermodynamic backgroundedit the enthalpy of vaporization can be written as the gibbs free energy change falls with increasing temperature gases are favored at higher temperatures as is observed in practice vaporization enthalpy of electrolyte solutionsedit estimation of the enthalpy of vaporization of electrolyte solutions can be simply carried out using equations based on the chemical thermodynamic models such as pitzer model1 or tcpc model.2 selected valuesedit elementsedit the vaporization of metals is a key step in metal vapor synthesis which exploits the increased reactivity of metal atoms or small particles relative to the bulk elements other common substancesedit enthalpies of vaporization of common substances measured at their respective standard boiling points see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

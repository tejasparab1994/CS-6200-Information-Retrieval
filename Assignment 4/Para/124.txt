list of historic tropical cyclone names the official practice of naming tropical cyclones started in 1945 within the western pacific naming continued through the next few years before in 1950 names also started to be assigned to tropical storms forming in the north atlantic ocean in the atlantic names were originally taken from the world war two version of the phonetic alphabet but this was changed in 1953 to use lists of women names which were created yearly around this time naming of tropical cyclones also began within the southern and central parts of the pacific however naming didn't begin in the eastern pacific until 1960 with the original naming lists designed to be used year after year in sequence in 1960 naming also began in the southwest indian ocean and in 1963 the philippine meteorological service started assigning names to tropical cyclones that moved into or formed in their area of responsibility later in 1963 warning centers within the australian region also commenced naming tropical cyclones in 2011 the brazilian navy hydrographic center started using naming list to name tropical cyclones over the south atlantic basin contents north atlanticedit by 1950 tropical cyclones that were judged by the us weather bureau to have intensified into a tropical storm started to be assigned names.12 storms were originally named in alphabetical order using the world war two version of the phonetic alphabet.1 by 1952 a new phonetic alphabet had been developed and this led to confusion as some parties wanted to use the newer phonetic alphabet.1 in 1953 to alleviate any confusion forecasters decided to use a set of 23 feminine names.12 after the 1953 atlantic hurricane season public reception to the idea seemed favorable so the same list was adopted for the next year with one change gilda for gail.1 however after storms like carol and hazel got a lot of publicity during the 1953 season forecasters agreed to develop a new set of names for 1955.1 however before this could happen a tropical storm was declared significant on january 2 1955 and was named as alice.1 the new set of names were developed and used in 1955 beginning with brenda continuing through the alphabet to zelda.1 for each season before 1960 a new set of names were developed.1 in 1960 forecasters decided to begin rotating names in a regular sequence and thus four alphabetical lists were established to be repeated every four years.3 the sets followed the example of the western pacific typhoon naming lists and excluded names beginning with the letters q u x y and z.3 these four lists were used until 1972 when the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa replaced them with 9 lists designed to be used from 1972.3 in 1977 noaa made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the world meteorological organization to select the new sets of names which would contain male names and some spanish and french names in order to reflect all the cultures and languages within the atlantic ocean.23 the world meteorological organization decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1979.23 since 1979 the same lists have been used with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names.2 in 2002 subtropical cyclones started to be assigned names from the main list of names set up for that year in 2005 as all the names preselected for the season were exhausted the contingency plan of using greek letters for names had to be used.4 since then there have been a few attempts to get rid of the greek names as they are seen to be inconsistent with the standard naming convention used for tropical cyclones and are considered generally unknown and confusing to the public.5 however the lists of preselected names for the year are not expected to be used up frequently enough to warrant any change in the existing naming procedure and thus the greek alphabet will be used if the list of pre selected names should ever be used up again.567 eastern pacificedit in 1977 after protests by various women's rights groups noaa made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the world meteorological organization wmo to select new sets of names.3 the wmo selected six lists of names which contained male names and rotated every six years.3 they also decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the atlantic.36 since 1978 the same lists of names have been used with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names.34 as in the atlantic basin should the names preselected for the season be exhausted the contingency plan of using greek letters for names would be used.3437 however unlike in the atlantic basin the contingency plan has never had to be used although in 1985 to avoid using the contingency plan the letters x y and z were added to the lists.37 since the contingency plan had to be used in the north atlantic during 2005 there have been a few attempts to get rid of the greek names as they are seen to be inconsistent with the standard naming convention used for tropical cyclones and are generally unknown and confusing to the public.56 however none of the attempts have succeeded and thus the greek letters will be used should the lists be used up.56 western north pacificedit in the western north pacific ocean there are two sets of names generally used the first are the international names assigned to a tropical cyclone by the japan meteorological agency jma or the joint typhoon warning center jtwc the second set of names are local names assigned to a tropical cyclone by the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration this system often ends up with a tropical cyclone being assigned two names should a tropical storm threaten the philippines on january 1 2000 the japan meteorological agency as the official regional specialized meteorological center took over the naming of tropical storms the names selected by the world meteorological organization's typhoon committee were from a pool of names submitted by the various countries that make up the typhoon committee philippinesedit north indian oceanedit during its annual session in 2000 the wmo/escap panel on north indian tropical cyclones agreed in principle to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the north indian ocean.6364 as a result the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur by the end of the year 2000.64 at the 2001 session of the panel the rapporteur reported that seven of the eight countries had submitted their names.64 however india had refused to submit a list of names as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones due to the regional cultural and linguistic diversity of the panel members.64 the panel subsequently studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and requested that members submit new lists of names.64 at the following years session the rapporteur reported that there had been a poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names.64 in response the panel felt that it was important that the work continued and urged the members to copperate and submit their names to the rapporteur.64 the names were subsequently submitted in time for the 2004 session however india had still not submitted their names despite promising to do so.64 the rapporteur presented the 4 lists of names that would be used with a gap left for india's names and recommended that the india meteorological department's regional specialised meteorological centre in new delhi name the systems.64 the rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists were used on an experimental basis during the season starting in may or june 2004 and that the lists should only be used until 2009 when a new list would be drawn up for the following ten years.64 the naming lists were then completed in may 2004 after india submitted their names however the lists were not used until september 2004 when the first tropical cyclone was named onil by india meteorological department.6365 south-west indian

intertropical convergence zone the intertropical convergence zone itcz known by sailors as the doldrums is the area encircling earth near the equator where the northeast and southeast trade winds converge the itcz was originally identified from the 1920s to the 1940s as the intertropical front itf but after the recognition in the 1940s and 1950s of the significance of wind field convergence in tropical weather production the term itcz was then applied.1 when it lies near the equator it is called the near-equatorial trough where the itcz is drawn into and merges with a monsoonal circulation it is sometimes referred to as a monsoon trough a usage more common in australia and parts of asia in the seamen's speech the zone is referred to as the doldrums because of its erratic weather patterns with stagnant calms and violent thunderstorms the itcz appears as a band of clouds usually thunderstorms that encircle the globe near the equator in the northern hemisphere the trade winds move in a southwestward direction from the northeast while in the southern hemisphere they move northwestward from the southeast when the itcz is positioned north or south of the equator these directions change according to the coriolis effect imparted by earth's rotation for instance when the itcz is situated north of the equator the southeast trade wind changes to a southwest wind as it crosses the equator the itcz is formed by vertical motion largely appearing as convective activity of thunderstorms driven by solar heating which effectively draw air in these are the trade winds.2 the itcz is effectively a tracer of the ascending branch of the hadley cell and is wet the dry descending branch is the horse latitudes the location of the itcz gradually varies with the seasons over land it moves back and forth across the equator following the sun's zenith point at high noon over the oceans where the convergence zone is better defined the seasonal cycle is more subtle as the convection is constrained by the distribution of ocean temperatures sometimes a double itcz forms with one located north and another south of the equator one of which is usually stronger than the other when this occurs a narrow ridge of high pressure forms between the two convergence zones  contents  south pacific convergence zoneedit effects on weatheredit variation in the location of the intertropical convergence zone drastically affects rainfall in many equatorial nations resulting in the wet and dry seasons of the tropics rather than the cold and warm seasons of higher latitudes longer term changes in the intertropical convergence zone can result in severe droughts or flooding in nearby areas within the itcz the average winds are slight unlike the zones north and south of the equator where the trade winds feed early sailors named this belt of calm the doldrums because of the inactivity and stagnation they found themselves in after days of no wind to find oneself becalmed in this region in a hot and muggy climate could mean death in an era when wind was the only effective way to propel ships across the ocean even today leisure and competitive sailors attempt to cross the zone as quickly as possible as the erratic weather and wind patterns may cause unexpected delays role in tropical cyclone formationedit hazardsedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

trade winds the trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics within the lower portion of the earth's atmosphere in the lower section of the troposphere near the earth's equator the trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the northern hemisphere and from the southeast in the southern hemisphere strengthening during the winter and when the arctic oscillation is in its warm phase trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world's oceans for centuries and enabled european empire expansion into the americas and trade routes to become established across the atlantic and pacific oceans in meteorology the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the atlantic pacific and southern indian oceans and make landfall in north america southeast asia and madagascar and eastern africa respectively trade winds also transport african dust westward across the atlantic ocean into the caribbean sea as well as portions of southeastern north america shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge the weaker the trade winds become the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses  contents  historyedit the captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel.4 during the age of sail the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access and therefore had a direct effect on european empire-building and thus on modern political geography for example manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.3 by the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to england's merchant fleet for crossing the atlantic ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of 'trade' foreign commerce.5 between 1847 and 1849 matthew fontaine maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world's oceans.6 causeedit as part of the hadley cell circulation surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles a low-pressure area of calm light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums7 near-equatorial trough8 intertropical front or the intertropical convergence zone.9 when located within a monsoon region this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough.10 around 30 in both hemispheres air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high-pressure belts known as subtropical ridges the subsident sinking air is relatively dry because as it descends the temperature increases but the absolute humidity remains constant which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass this warm dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical warm and moist air mass an increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion when it occurs within a trade wind regime it is known as a trade wind inversion.11 the surface air that flows from these subtropical high-pressure belts toward the equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the coriolis effect.12 these winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the northern hemisphere and from the southeast in the southern hemisphere.13 because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is blowing14 these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the northern hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the southern hemisphere the trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums.7 as they blow across tropical regions air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more direct sunlight those that develop over land continental are drier and hotter than those that develop over oceans maritime and travel northward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge.15 maritime tropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses.16 the one region of the earth which has an absence of trade winds is the north indian ocean.17 weather effectsedit during mid-summer in the northern hemisphere july the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the caribbean sea into southeastern north america florida and gulf coast when dust from the sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge travels over land rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates.23 although the southeast usa has some of the cleanest air in north america much of the african dust that reaches the united states affects florida.24 since 1970 dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in africa there is a large variability in the dust transport to the caribbean and florida from year to year.25 dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the caribbean and florida primarily since the 1970s.26 see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation

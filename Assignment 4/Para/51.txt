waterspout a waterspout is an intense columnar vortex usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud that occurs over a body of water some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud.1 in the common form it is a non-supercell tornado over water.123 while it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur.45 most waterspouts do not suck up water they are small and weak rotating columns of air over water.16 while waterspouts form mostly in the tropics and subtropical areas1 other areas also report waterspouts including europe new zealand the great lakes antarctica78 and on rare occasions the great salt lake.9 although rare waterspouts have been observed in connection with lake-effect snow precipitation bands waterspouts have a five-part life cycle formation of a dark spot on the water surface spiral pattern on the water surface formation of a spray ring development of the visible condensation funnel and ultimately decay  contents  formationedit waterspouts exist on a microscale where their environment is less than two kilometers in width the cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus or as great as a supercell while some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics they normally develop in moisture-laden environments as their parent clouds are in the process of development and it is theorized they spin as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm weak tornadoes known as landspouts have been shown to develop in a similar manner.10 more than one waterspout can occur in the same vicinity at the same time as many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on lake michigan.7 the illustration on the left by james pollard espy in 1841 shows the manner in which one spout while forming tends to generate others in its neighborhood typesedit non-tornadicedit they are most frequently seen in tropical and sub-tropical climates with upwards of 400 per year observed in the florida keys.12 they typically move slowly if at all since the cloud to which they are attached is horizontally static being formed by vertical convective action instead of the subduction/adduction interaction between colliding fronts.1213 fair-weather waterspouts are very similar in both appearance and mechanics to landspouts and largely behave as such if they move ashore.12 tornadicedit tornadic waterspouts also accurately referred to as tornadoes over water are formed from mesocyclonic action in a manner essentially identical to traditional land-based tornadoes in connection with severe thunderstorms but simply occurring over water.14 a tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout.15 since the vast majority of mesocyclonic thunderstorms occur in land-locked areas of the united states true tornadic waterspouts are correspondingly rarer than their fair-weather counterparts in that country however in some areas such as the adriatic aegean and ionian seas tornadic waterspouts can make up half of the total number.16 snowspoutedit a winter waterspout also known as a snow devil an icespout an ice devil a snownado or a snowspout is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a snow squall.1718 the term winter waterspout is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date four of which were taken in ontario canada there are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce fog resembling steam above the water's surface like the more efficient lake-effect snow events winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development.19 climatologyedit life cycleedit there are five stages to the waterspout life cycle initially a prominent circular light-colored disk appears on the surface of the water surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape after the formation of these colored disks on the water a pattern of light and dark-colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface then a dense annulus of sea spray called a cascade appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an eye eventually the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud the spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves eventually the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens ending the waterspout's life cycle.13 marine hazardedit waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft aircraft and people.26 it is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena and to always be on alert through weather reports the united states national weather service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore.27 incidents of waterspouts causing severe damage and casualties are rare however there have been several notable examples the malta tornado in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly waterspout it struck the grand harbour of valletta sinking four galleys numerous boats and claiming hundreds of lives.28 the 1851 sicily tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western sicily ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea a waterspout has been proposed as a possible reason for the inexplicable abandonment of the mary celeste threat to marine animalsedit on september 28 2017 according to the associated press rain in tampico on northeastern mexico's gulf coast included fish.30 research and

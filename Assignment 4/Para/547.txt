carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer expected by many fans to become the world's greatest boxing champion when three victims specifically the club's bartender and a male and a female customer were shot to death in a bar in paterson new jersey carter and his friend john artis driving home from another club in paterson were stopped and interrogated by the police although the police asserted

basis of bello's testimony carter and artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club carter was given three consecutive life sentences throughout the trial carter proclaimed his innocence

constitutional violations and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts as a result carter was finally freed and he summed up his story by saying hate got me into this place love got me out.2 castedit productionedit backgroundedit norman jewison got interested in a hurricane carter biopic in 1992.3 armyan bernstein purchased the filming rights through beacon pictures and went on to write the first scripts while establishing a financing partnership with irving azoff.4 at first jewison felt the story was so extensive that it would fit better as a television miniseries.3 once denzel washington signed to play the title character he went through long boxing training and worked closely with rubin carter washington said he went through pots and pots of coffee and packs of cigarettes i'd drink a little coffee it's interesting and challenging when the person is there alive and in the room.5 filming began in november 1998 with locations in both new jersey  east jersey state prison in trenton and the cities of avenel and paterson  and toronto.6 soundtrackedit releaseedit premiereedit the hurricane premiered on september 17 1999 at the toronto international film

circulation sixteen weeks.9 critical responseedit reviews were positive with much praise to denzel washington's performance the film has an 83 approval rating at rotten tomatoes based on 113 reviews the consensus reads thanks in large part to one of denzel washington's most powerful on-screen performances the hurricane is a moving inspirational sports drama even if it takes few risks in telling its story.10 roger ebert film critic for the chicago sun times liked the film and the acting and wrote this is one of denzel washington's great performances on a par with his work in malcolm x....washington as hurricane carter is spare focused filled with anger and pride... this is strong stuff and i was amazed after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts until at the end i was blinking at tears what affects me emotionally at the movies is never sadness but goodness.11 regarding the fictionalized aspects of the film ebert discussed why that is often the case in films several people have told me dubiously that they heard the movie was 'fictionalized' well of course it was those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother most biopics like most grandmothers see the good in a man and demonize his enemies they pass silently over his imprudent romances in dramatizing his victories they simplify them and they provide the best roles to the most interesting characters if they didn't we wouldn't pay to see them. he added the hurricane is not a documentary but a parable in which two lives are saved by the power of the written word.11 film critic stephen holden writing for the new york times had mixed views of the film but did like the acting he wrote in telling the story of mr carter's protracted and ultimately successful fight for freedom and justice the hurricane rides to glory on an astonishing performance by denzel washington....that is to say mr washington leans into an otherwise schlocky movie and slams it out of the ballpark if his hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his character's forcefully articulate surface.12 holden was forthright about the veracity of the film writing the film is so eager to stir us up that it thinks little of bending the facts for dramatic effect among its most egregious distortions is its depiction of mr carter's 1964 middleweight title match with joey giardello the movie which has fine naturalistic boxing sequences inaccurately portrays the fight as lost by carter solely because of the judges racism the taking of such license of course adds an extra jolt of drama but when these and other distortions and exaggerations are added up it's worth wondering if that self-congratulatory glow the movie leaves us with has been gotten far too easily and at what cost.12 jewison considers the hurricane his best work.13 accoladesedit winsedit nominationsedit noteworthy mentionsedit the film is recognized by american film institute in these lists controversyedit film

the pittsburgh post-gazette lona manning;19 the new york times reporter robert lipsyte;20 paul mulshine of the star-ledger and jack newfield of the new york post who stated i knew rubin carter attended his fights covered his retrial and i didn't see much reality on the screen.citation needed the new yorker film critic david denby called it false evasive and factually very thin  a liberal fairytale.21 lawsuitedit eventually the case was settled out of court with the producers paying the retired champion damages and with jewison agreeing to make a statement on the dvd version that giardello no doubt was a great fighter.24 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export

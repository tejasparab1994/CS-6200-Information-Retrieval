2010 census its population was 449226 with just under 8 percent of marylanders living in the region the term eastern shore distinguishes a territorial part of the state of maryland from the western shore of maryland land west of the chesapeake bay  contents  geographyedit in 1668 philip calvert obtained virginia recognition of maryland's claims to present-day somerset county surveying a dividing line between the two colonies with surveyor general of virginia edmund scarborough meanwhile he negotiated treaties with lower eastern shore indian tribes harassing english settlers these treaties defined standards of conduct for indian-english relations establishing an overall peace in the region.1 like new castle county delaware cecil county is crossed by the fall line a geologic division where the rockier highlands of the piedmont region meet the atlantic coastal plain a flat sandy area that forms the coast the coastal plain includes the delmarva peninsula and hence the eastern shore of maryland the geology of delmarva is an inseparable part of the eastern shore which has few rocky outcrops south of kent county the chesapeake and delaware canal crosses from back creek on the elk river to port penn delaware while it was a shallow canal with locks after its construction in 1829 it was deepened in the early 20th century to sea level and physically separates the delmarva peninsula from the rest of the united states maryland south of the canal is considered the eastern shore by residents the term western shore is used by eastern shore residents to describe all the counties of maryland west of the chesapeake bay but especially those of the baltimore-washington metropolitan area and southern maryland finally although this has received less attention than other parts of eastern shore culture commercial east-west ties between delaware towns and maryland towns were culturally significant in colonial and early american periods despite the border line which largely cut through woods and swamps trade with philadelphia was conducted by overland routes to delaware towns like odessa then called cantwell's bridge and smyrna then called duck creek agricultural products and milled grain were taken up the delaware river by shallop men in small vessels called shallops these cultural connections continue to this day ocean city is a modern resort on what was once called the seaside or seaboard side. it is on a long north-south sandspit that is essentially a barrier island.2 historyedit early historyedit william claiborne was granted land part of the colony of virginia in 1629 and named the land kent county in 1631 he sailed north up the chesapeake bay from its south and west side to the area known today as kent island there he made a fortified

well south of ocean city the ocean city inlet was not formed until a hurricane in august 1933 cut across the south end of the town although the inlet was cut not by waves sweeping inland but by 4 or 5 days worth of freshwater runoff from the coastal creeks running seaward by 1935 government money had built jetties to make the inlet permanent dividing fenwick island north from assateague island south early transportation to the island was by train until the 1820s travel and commerce between the eastern shore and baltimore were less important than the connections between it and philadelphia water travel by sailboat and steamer linked the eastern shore to baltimore more tightly beginning about 1813 when the first steamboat traveled the bay by the 1880s railroad lines linked the eastern shore to philadelphia and later norfolk virginia by way of a railroad line straight south from wilmington to dover delmar salisbury and cape charles maryland's eastern shore was served by branch lines running generally southwest from the main route see list of railroad lines in the delmarva peninsula the eastern shore's many branchlines were built after the civil war by local companies eventually all were controlled by the pennsylvania railroad which also bought control of the steamboat and ferry routes then conrail and norfolk southern today the remaining active railroad tracks on the eastern shore are operated by short-line railroads bay coast railroad delmarva central railroad and the maryland and delaware railroad an east-west rail route ran from a ferry terminal at claiborne west of st

microsoft powerpoint powerpoint became a component of the microsoft office suite first offered in 1989 for macintosh8 and in 1990 for windows9 which bundled several microsoft apps beginning with powerpoint 4.0 1994 powerpoint was integrated into microsoft office development and adopted shared common components and a converged user interface.10 powerpoint was originally designed to provide visuals for group presentations within business organizations but has come to be very widely used in many other communication situations both in business and beyond.13 the impact of this much wider use of powerpoint has been experienced as a powerful change throughout society14 with strong reactions including advice that it should be used less15 should be used differently16 or should be used better.17 the first powerpoint version macintosh 1987 was used to produce overhead transparencies18 the second macintosh 1988 windows 1990 could also produce color 35mm slides.18 the third version windows and macintosh 1992 introduced video output of virtual slideshows to digital projectors which would over time completely replace physical transparencies and slides.18 a dozen major versions since then have added many additional features and modes of operation10 and have made powerpoint available beyond apple macintosh and microsoft windows adding versions for ios android and web access.19  contents  historyedit powerpoint was created by robert gaskins and dennis austin at a software startup in silicon valley named forethought inc.20 forethought had been founded in 1983 to create an integrated environment and applications for future personal computers that would provide a graphical user interface but it had run into difficulties requiring a restart and new plan.21 on july 5 1984 forethought hired robert gaskins as its vice president of product development22p51 to create a new application that would be especially suited to the new graphical personal computers such as microsoft windows and apple macintosh.23 gaskins produced his initial description of powerpoint about a month later august 14 1984 in the form of a 2-page document titled presentation graphics for overhead projection.24 by october 1984 gaskins had selected dennis austin to be the developer for powerpoint.25 gaskins and austin worked together on the definition and design of the new product for nearly a year and produced the first specification document dated august 21 1985.26 this first design document showed a product as it would look in microsoft windows 1.027 which at that time had not been released.28 development from that spec was begun by austin in november 1985 for macintosh first.22p104 about six months later on may 1 1986 gaskins and austin chose a second developer to join the project thomas rudkin.22p149 gaskins prepared two final product specification marketing documents in june 1986 these described a product for both macintosh and windows.2930 at about the same time austin rudkin and gaskins produced a second and final major design specification document this time showing a macintosh look.31 throughout this development period the product was called presenter. then just before release there was a last-minute check with forethought's lawyers to register the name as a trademark and presenter was unexpectedly rejected because it had already been used by someone else gaskins says that he thought of powerpoint based on the product's goal of empowering individual presenters and sent that name to the lawyers for clearance while all the documentation was hastily revised.32 powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh shipped from manufacturing on april 20 1987 and the first production run of 10000 units was sold out.35 by early 1987 microsoft was starting to plan a new application to create presentations an activity led by jeff raikes who was head of marketing for the applications division.36 microsoft assigned an internal group to write a specification and plan for a new presentation product.37 they contemplated an acquisition to speed up development and in early 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire dave winer's product called more an outlining program that could print its outlines as bullet charts.38 during this preparatory activity raikes discovered that a program specifically to make overhead presentations was already being developed by forethought inc. and that it was nearly completed.36 raikes and others visited forethought on february 6 1987 for a confidential demonstration.22p173 raikes later recounted his reaction to seeing powerpoint and his report about it to bill gates who was initially skeptical:36 when powerpoint was released by forethought its initial press was favorable the wall street journal reported on early reactions 'i see about one product a year i get this excited about says amy wohl a consultant in bala cynwyd pa 'people will buy a macintosh just to get access to this product.'39 on april 28 1987 a week after shipment a group of microsoft's senior executives spent another day at forethought to hear about initial powerpoint sales on macintosh and plans for windows.22p191 the following day microsoft sent a letter to dave winer withdrawing its earlier letter of intent to acquire his company40 and in mid-may 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire forethought.41 as requested in that letter of intent robert gaskins from forethought went to redmond for a one-on-one meeting with bill gates in early june 198722p197 and by the end of july an agreement was concluded for an acquisition the new york times reported:42 microsoft's president jon shirley offered microsoft's motivation for the acquisition 'we made this deal primarily because of our belief in desktop presentations as a product category .. forethought was first to market with a product in this category.'44 microsoft set up within its applications division an independent graphics business unit to develop and to market powerpoint the first microsoft application group distant from the main redmond location.44 all the powerpoint people from forethought joined microsoft and the new location was headed by robert gaskins with dennis austin and thomas rudkin leading development.45 powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh was modified to indicate the new microsoft ownership and continued to be sold.45 a new powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh adding color 35mm slides appeared by mid-198845 and again won good reviews.46 the same powerpoint 2.0 product re-developed for windows was shipped two years later in mid-1990 at the same time as windows 3.0.47 much of the color technology was the fruit of a joint development partnership with genigraphics at that time the dominant presentation services company.48 powerpoint 3.0 which was shipped in 1992 for both windows and mac added live video for projectors and monitors with the result that powerpoint was thereafter used for delivering presentations as well as for preparing them this was at first an alternative to overhead transparencies and 35mm slides but over time would come to replace them.49 part of microsoft office since 1993edit powerpoint had been included in microsoft office from the beginning powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh was part of the first office bundle for macintosh which was offered in mid-1989.50 when powerpoint 2.0 for windows appeared a year later it was part of a similar office bundle for windows which was offered in late 1990.51 both of these were bundling promotions in which the independent applications were packaged together and offered for a lower total price.5051 powerpoint 3.0 1992 was again separately specified and developed52 and was prominently advertised and sold separately from office.53 it was as before included in microsoft office 3.0 both for windows and the corresponding version for macintosh.54 a plan to integrate the applications themselves more tightly had been indicated as early as february 1991 toward the end of powerpoint 3.0 development in an internal memo by bill gates:55 when it was released the computer press reported on the change approvingly powerpoint 4.0 has been re-engineered from the ground up to resemble and work with the latest applications in office word 6.0 excel 5.0 and access 2.0 the integration is so good you'll have to look twice to make sure you're running powerpoint and not word or excel.57 office integration was further underscored in the following version powerpoint 95 which was given the version number powerpoint 7.0 skipping 5.0 and 6.0 so that all the components of office would share the same major version number.58 although powerpoint by this point had become part of the integrated microsoft office product its development remained in silicon valley succeeding versions of powerpoint introduced important changes particularly version 12.0 2007 which had a very different shared office ribbon user interface and a new shared office xml-based file format.59 this marked the 20th anniversary of powerpoint and microsoft held an event to commemorate that anniversary at its silicon valley campus for the powerpoint team there special guests were robert gaskins dennis austin and thomas rudkin and the featured speaker was jeff raikes all from powerpoint 1.0 days 20 years before.60 since then major development of powerpoint as part of office has continued new development techniques61 shared across office for powerpoint 2016 have made it possible to ship versions of powerpoint 2016 for windows mac ios android and web access nearly simultaneously19 and to release new features on a nearly-monthly schedule.62 powerpoint development is still located in silicon valley as of 2017update.63 sales and market shareedit powerpoint's initial sales were about 40000 copies sold in 1987 nine months about 85000 copies in 1988 and about 100000 copies in 1989 all for macintosh.65 powerpoint's market share in its first three years was a tiny part of the total presentation market which was very heavily dominated by ms-dos applications on pcs.66 the market leaders on ms-dos in 1988-198967 were harvard graphics introduced by software publishing in 198668 in first place and lotus freelance plus also introduced in 198669 as a strong second.70 they were competing with more than a dozen other ms-dos presentation products71 and microsoft did not develop a powerpoint version for ms-dos.72 after three years powerpoint sales were disappointing jeff raikes who had bought powerpoint for microsoft later recalled by 1990 it looked like it wasn't a very smart idea for microsoft to have acquired powerpoint because not very many people were using powerpoint.36 since the late 1990s powerpoint's market share of total world presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent by both industry and academic sources.76 operationedit .. in the business lexicon powerpoint presentation had come to refer to a presentation made using a powerpoint slideshow projected from a computer although the powerpoint software had been used to generate transparencies for over a decade this usage was not typically encompassed by common understanding of the term in contemporary operation powerpoint is used to create a file called a presentation or deck81 containing a sequence of pages called slides in the app which usually have a consistent style from template masters and which may contain information imported from other apps or created in powerpoint including text bullet lists tables charts drawn shapes images audio clips video clips animations of elements and animated transitions between slides plus attached notes for each slide.82 after such a file is created typical operation is to present it as a slide show using a portable computer where the presentation file is stored on the computer or available from a network and the computer's screen shows a presenter view with current slide next slide speaker's notes for the current slide and other information.83 video is sent from the computer to one or more external digital projectors or monitors showing only the current slide to the audience with sequencing controlled by the speaker at the computer a smartphone remote control built in to powerpoint for ios optionally controlled from apple watch84 and for android85 allows the presenter to control the show from elsewhere in the room in addition to a computer slide show projected to a live audience by a speaker powerpoint can be used to deliver a presentation in a number of other ways some of these ways of using powerpoint have been studied by joanne yates and wanda orlikowski of the mit sloan school of management:80 the standard form of such presentations involves a single person standing before a group of people talking and using the powerpoint slideshow to project visual aids onto a screen .. in practice however presentations are not always delivered in this mode in our studies we often found that the presenter sat at a table with a small group of people and walked them through a deck composed of paper copies of the slides in some cases decks were simply distributed to individuals without even a walk-through or discussion .. other variations in form included sending the powerpoint file electronically to another site and talking through the slides over an audio or video channel e.g. telephone or video conference as both parties viewed the slides .. another common variation was placing a powerpoint file on a web site for people to view at different times they found that some of these ways of using powerpoint could influence the content of presentations for example when the slides themselves have to carry more of the substance of the presentation and thus need considerably more content than they would have if they were intended for projection by a speaker who would orally provide additional details and nuance about content and context.80 cultural impactedit powerpoint more than most other personal computer applications has been experienced as a powerful force producing change throughout all of society in 2016 an analyst summed up the real mystery is .. 'how come almost every organisation in the world is using powerpoint to communicate almost everything to almost everybody?' that's the real question how come powerpoint is everywhere?14 business usesedit powerpoint use in business grew over its first five years 1987-1992 to sales of about 1 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 63 percent.96 over the following five years 1992-1997 powerpoint sales accelerated to a rate of about 4 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 85 percent.97 the increase in business use has been attributed to network effects whereby additional users of powerpoint in a company or an industry increased its salience and value to other users.98 not everyone immediately approved of the greater use of powerpoint for presentations even in business ceos who very early were reported to discourage or ban powerpoint presentations at internal business meetings included lou gerstner at ibm in 199399 scott mcnealy at sun microsystems in 1996100 and steve jobs at apple in 1997.101 but even so rich gold a scholar who studied corporate presentation use at xerox parc could write in 1999 within today's corporation if you want to communicate an idea .. you use powerpoint.102 uses beyond businessedit at the same time that powerpoint was becoming dominant in business settings it was also being adopted for uses beyond business personal computing .. scaled up the production of presentations .. the result has been the rise of presentation culture in an information society nearly everyone presents.103 in 1998 at about the same time that gold was pronouncing powerpoint's ubiquity in business the influential bell labs engineer robert w lucky could already write about broader uses:104 .. the world has run amok with the giddy power of presentation graphics a new language is in the air and it is codified in powerpoint .. in a family discussion about what to do on a given evening for example i feel like pulling out my laptop and giving a vugraph presentation ..  in church i am surprised that the preachers haven't caught on yet .. how have we gotten on so long without powerpoint over a decade or so beginning in the mid 1990s powerpoint began to be used in many communication situations well beyond its original business presentation uses to include teaching in schools105 and in universities106 lecturing in scientific meetings107 and preparing their related poster sessions108 worshipping in churches109 making legal arguments in courtrooms110 displaying supertitles in theaters111 driving helmet-mounted displays in spacesuits for nasa astronauts112 giving military briefings113 issuing governmental reports114 undertaking diplomatic negotiations115116 writing novels117 giving architectural demonstrations118 prototyping website designs119 creating animated video games120 creating art projects121 and even as a substitute for writing engineering technical reports122 and as an organizing tool for writing general business documents.123 by 2003 it seemed that powerpoint was being used everywhere julia keller reported for the chicago tribune:124 powerpoint .. is one of the most pervasive and ubiquitous technological tools ever concocted in less than a decade it has revolutionized the worlds of business education science and communications swiftly becoming the standard for just about anybody who wants to explain just about anything to just about anybody else from corporate middle managers reporting on production goals to 4th-graders fashioning a show-and-tell on the french and indian war to church pastors explicating the seven deadly sins .. powerpoint seems poised for world domination cultural reactionsedit as uses broadened cultural awareness of powerpoint grew and commentary about it began to appear with the widespread adoption of powerpoint came complaints .. often very general statements reflecting dissatisfaction with modern media and communication practices as well as the dysfunctions of organizational culture.125 indications of this awaremess included increasing mentions of powerpoint use in the dilbert comic strips of scott adams126 comic parodies of poor or inappropriate use such as the gettysburg address in powerpoint127128 or summaries of shakespeare's hamlet and nabokov's lolita in powerpoint129 and a vast number of publications on the general subject of powerpoint especially about how to use it.130 out of all the analyses of powerpoint over a quarter of a century at least three general themes emerged as categories of reaction to its broader use 1 use it less avoid powerpoint in favor of alternatives such as using more-complex graphics and written prose or using nothing;15 2 use it differently make a major change to a powerpoint style that is simpler and pictorial turning the presentation toward a performance more like a steve jobs keynote;16 and 3 use it better retain much of the conventional powerpoint style but learn to avoid making many kinds of mistakes that can interfere with communication.17 use it lessedit in 2003 he published a widely-read booklet titled the cognitive style of powerpoint revised in 2006.15 tufte found a number of problems with the cognitive style of powerpoint many of which he attributed to the standard default style templates:15 powerpoint's convenience for some presenters is costly to the content and the audience these costs arise from the cognitive style characteristics of the standard default pp presentation foreshortening of evidence and thought low spatial resolution an intensely hierarchical single-path structure as the model for organizing every type of content breaking up narratives and data into slides and minimal fragments rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis conspicuous chartjunk and pp phluff branding of slides with logotypes a preoccupation with format not content incompetent designs for data graphics and tables and a smirky commercialism that turns information into a sales pitch and presenters into marketeers italics in original much of the early commentary on all sides was informal and anecdotal because empirical research had been limited.136 use it differentlyedit tufte had argued his judgment that the information density of text on powerpoint slides was too low perhaps only 40 words on a slide leading to over-simplified messages;138 mayer responded that his empirical research showed exactly the opposite that the amount of text on powerpoint slides was usually too high and that even fewer than 40 words on a slide resulted in powerpoint overload that impeded understanding during presentations.139 mayer suggested a few major changes from traditional powerpoint formats:16 consistent with its association with steve jobs's keynotes a response to this style has been that it is particularly effective for ballroom-style presentations as often given in conference center ballrooms where a celebrated and practiced speaker addresses a large passive audience but less appropriate for conference room-style presentations which are often recurring internal business meetings for in-depth discussion with motivated counterparts.142 use it betteredit a third reaction to powerpoint use was to conclude that the standard style is capable of being used well but that many small points need to be executed carefully to avoid impeding understanding this kind of analysis is particularly associated with stephen kosslyn a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in the psychology of learning and visual communication and who has been head of the department of psychology at harvard has been director of stanford's center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences and has published some 300 papers and 14 books.143 kosslyn presented a set of psychological principles of human perception memory and comprehension that appears to capture the major points of agreement among researchers.144 he reports that his experiments support the idea that that it is not intuitive or obvious how to create effective powerpoint presentations that conform to those agreed principles and that even small differences that might not seem significant to a presenter can produce very different results in audiences understanding for this reason kosslyn says users need specific education to be able to identify best ways to avoid flaws and failures:144 specifically we hypothesized and found that the psychological principles are often violated in powerpoint slideshows across different fields ..  that some types of presentation flaws are noticeable and annoying to audience members ..  and that observers have difficulty identifying many violations in graphical displays in individual slides ..  these studies converge in painting the following picture powerpoint presentations are commonly flawed some types of flaws are more common than others flaws are not isolated to one domain or context and although some types of flaws annoy the audience flaws at the level of slide design are not always obvious to an untrained observer ..  the many flaws and failures identified were those likely to disrupt the comprehension or memory of the material. among the most common examples were bulleted items are not presented individually growing the list from the top to the bottom more than four bulleted items appear in a single list more than two lines are used per bulleted sentence and words are not large enough i.e. greater than 20 point to be easily seen. among audience reactions common problems reported were speakers read word-for-word from notes or from the slides themselves the slides contained too much material to absorb before the next slide was presented and the main point was obscured by lots of irrelevant detail.144 kosslyn observes that these findings could help to explain why the many studies of instructional effectiveness of powerpoint have been inconclusive and conflicting if there were differences in the quality of the presentations tested in different studies that went unobserved because many may feel that 'good design is intuitively clear.144 .. there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the powerpoint program as a medium rather i claim that the problem lies in how it is used .. in fact this medium is a remarkably versatile tool that can be extraordinarily effective .. for many purposes powerpoint presentations are a superior medium of communication which is why they have become standard in so many fields u.s military excessedit use of powerpoint by the u.s military services began slowly because they were invested in mainframe computers ms-dos pcs and specialized military-specification graphic output devices all of which powerpoint did not support.148 but because of the strong military tradition of presenting briefings as soon as they acquired the computers needed to run it powerpoint became part of the u.s military.149 by 2000 ten years after powerpoint for windows appeared it was already identified as an important feature of u.s armed forces culture in a front-page story in the wall street journal:150 old-fashioned slide briefings designed to update generals on troop movements have been a staple of the military since world war ii but in only a few short years powerpoint has altered the landscape just as word processing made it easier to produce long meandering memos the spread of powerpoint has unleashed a blizzard of jazzy but often incoherent visuals instead of drawing up a dozen slides on a legal pad and running them over to the graphics department captains and colonels now can create hundreds of slides in a few hours without ever leaving their desks if the spirit moves them they can build in gunfire sound effects and images that explode like land mines .. powerpoint has become such an ingrained part of the defense culture that it has seeped into the military lexicon powerpoint ranger is a derogatory term for a desk-bound bureaucrat more adept at making slides than tossing grenades u.s military use of powerpoint may have influenced its use by armed forces of other countries foreign armed services also are beginning to get in on the act 'you can't speak with the u.s military without knowing powerpoint says margaret hayes an instructor at national defense university in washington d.c. who teaches latin american military officers how to use the software.150 after another 10 years in 2010 and again on its front page the new york times reported that powerpoint use in the military was then a military tool that has spun out of control:151 like an insurgency powerpoint has crept into the daily lives of military commanders and reached the level of near obsession the amount of time expended on powerpoint the microsoft presentation program of computer-generated charts graphs and bullet points has made it a running joke in the pentagon and in iraq and afghanistan .. commanders say that behind all the powerpoint jokes are serious concerns that the program stifles discussion critical thinking and thoughtful decision-making not least it ties up junior officers .. in the daily preparation of slides be it for a joint staff meeting in washington or for a platoon leader's pre-mission combat briefing in a remote pocket of afghanistan the new york times account went on to say that as a result some u.s generals had banned the use of powerpoint in their operations:151 powerpoint makes us stupid gen james n mattis of the marine corps the joint forces commander said this month at a military conference in north carolina he spoke without powerpoint. brig gen h r mcmaster who banned powerpoint presentations when he led the successful effort to secure the northern iraqi city of tal afar in 2005 followed up at the same conference by likening powerpoint to an internal threat it's dangerous because it can create the illusion of understanding and the illusion of control general mcmaster said in a telephone interview afterward some problems in the world are not bullet-izable. the two generals who had been mentioned in 2010 as opposing the institutional culture of excessive powerpoint use were both in the news again in 2017 when james n mattis became u.s secretary of defense156 and h r mcmaster was appointed as u.s national security advisor.157 artistic mediumedit musician david byrne has been using powerpoint as a medium for art for years producing a book and dvd and showing at galleries his powerpoint-based artwork.121 byrne has written i have been working with powerpoint the ubiquitous presentation software as an art medium for a number of years it started off as a joke this software is a symbol of corporate salesmanship or lack thereof but then the work took on a life of its own as i realized i could create pieces that were moving despite the limitations of the 'medium.'158 the expressions powerpoint art or pptart are used to define a contemporary italian artistic movement which believes that the corporate world can be a unique and exceptional source of inspiration for the artist.161162 they say the pptart name refers to powerpoint the symbolic and abstract language developed by the corporate world which has become a universal and highly symbolic communication system beyond cultures and borders.163 the wide use of powerpoint had by 2010 given rise to  .. a subculture of powerpoint enthusiasts that is teaching the old application new tricks and may even be turning a dry presentation format into a full-fledged artistic medium164 by using powerpoint animation to create games artworks anime and movies.165 powerpoint vieweredit powerpoint viewer is the name for a series of small free application programs to be used on computers without powerpoint installed to view project or print but not create or edit presentations.166 the first version was introduced with powerpoint 3.0 in 1992 to enable electronic presentations to be projected using conference-room computers and to be freely distributed on windows it took advantage of the new feature of embedding truetype fonts within powerpoint presentation files to make such distribution easier.167 the same kind of viewer app was shipped with powerpoint 3.0 for macintosh also in 1992.168 beginning with powerpoint 2003 a feature called package for cd automatically managed all linked video and audio files plus needed fonts when exporting a presentation to a disk or flash drive or network location169 and also included a copy of a revised powerpoint viewer application so that the result could be presented on other pcs without installing anything.170 the latest version that runs on windows was created in conjunction with powerpoint 2010 but it can also be used to view newer presentations created in powerpoint 2013 and powerpoint 2016 .. all transitions videos and effects appear and behave the same when viewed using powerpoint viewer as they do when viewed in powerpoint 2010. it supports presentations created using powerpoint 97 and later.166 the latest version that runs on macintosh is powerpoint 98 viewer for the classic mac os and classic environment for macs supporting system 7.5 to mac os x tiger 10.4.171 it can open presentations only from powerpoint 3.0 4.0 and 8.0 powerpoint 98 although presentations created on mac can be opened in powerpoint viewer on windows.172 as of 2017update the latest versions of powerpoint viewer for windows 2010173 and for macintosh 1998174 remain available for download since powerpoint 2013 the recommended replacement for powerpoint viewer has been to use any computer with a browser and network access to display any accessible powerpoint presentation by using the free web app powerpoint online.175 versionsedit file formatsedit early versions of powerpoint from 1987 through 1995 versions 1.0 through 7.0 evolved through a sequence of binary file formats different in each version as functionality was added.250 that resulted in a stable binary format called a .ppt file like all earlier binary formats that was shared as the default in powerpoint 97 through powerpoint 2003 for windows and in powerpoint 98 through powerpoint 2004 for mac that is in powerpoint versions 8.0 through 11.0.251252 the specification document is actively maintained and can be freely downloaded251 because although no longer the default that binary format can be read and written by some later versions of powerpoint including the current powerpoint 2016.247 after the stable binary format was adopted versions of powerpoint continued to be able to read and write differing file formats from earlier versions.250 but beginning with powerpoint 2007 and powerpoint 2008 for mac powerpoint version 12.0 this was the only binary format available for saving powerpoint 2007 version 12.0 no longer supported saving to binary file formats used earlier than powerpoint 97 version 8.0 ten years before.253 binary filename extensions247 binary media types248 office open xml since 2007edit xml filename extensions247 xml media types248 the specification for the new format was published as an open standard ecma-376256 through ecma international technical committee 45 tc45.257 the ecma 376 stardard was approved in december 2006 and was submitted for standardization through iso/iec jtc 1/sc 34 wg4 in early 2007 the standardization process was contentious.258 it was approved as iso/iec 29500 in early 2008.259 copies of the iso/iec standard specification are freely available in two parts.260261 these define two related standards known as transitional and strict. the two standards were progressively adopted by powerpoint powerpoint version 12.0 2007 2008 for mac could read and write transitional format but could neither read nor write strict format powerpoint version 14.0 2010 2011 for mac could read and write transitional and also read but not write strict powerpoint version 15.0 and later beginning 2013 2016 for mac can read and write both transitional and strict formats the reason for the two variants was explained by microsoft:262 powerpoint 2013 and powerpoint 2016 provide options to set default saving to iso/iec 29500 strict format but the initial default setting remains transitional for compatibility with legacy features incorporating binary data in existing documents.267 powerpoint 2013 or powerpoint 2016 will both open and save files in the former binary format .ppt for compatibility with older versions of the program but not versions older than powerpoint 97.247268 in saving to older formats these versions of powerpoint will check to assure that no features have been introduced into the presentation which are incompatible with the older formats.254 powerpoint 2013 and 2016 will also save a presentation in many other file formats including pdf format mpeg-4 or wmv video as a sequence of single-picture files using image formats including gif jpeg png tiff and some older formats and as a single presentation file in which all slides are replaced with pictures powerpoint will both open and save files in opendocument presentation format odp for compatibility.247 see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation

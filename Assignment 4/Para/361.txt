china china emerged as one of the world's earliest civilizations in the fertile basin of the yellow river in the north china plain for millennia china's political system was based on hereditary monarchies or dynasties beginning with the semi-legendary xia dynasty since then china has expanded fractured and re-unified numerous times in 1912 the republic of china roc replaced the last dynasty and ruled the chinese mainland until 1949 when it was defeated by the communist people's liberation army in the chinese civil war the communist party established the people's republic of china in beijing on 21 september 1949 while the roc government retreated to taiwan with its present de facto capital in taipei both the roc and prc continue to claim to be the legitimate government of all china though the latter has more recognition in the world and controls more territory since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978 china's economy has been one of the world's fastest-growing as of 2016update it is the world's second-largest economy by nominal gdp and largest by purchasing power parity ppp china is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods.20 china is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army and second-largest defense budget.2122 the prc is a member of the united nations as it replaced the roc as a permanent member of the u.n security council in 1971 china is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations including the wto apec brics the shanghai cooperation organization sco the bcim and the g20 china is a great power and a major regional power within asia and has been characterized as a potential superpower.2324 contents names history prehistory early dynastic rule imperial china after the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed72 whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally-disabled emperor the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states the xianbei unified them as the northern wei whose emperor xiaowen reversed his predecessors apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into chinese culture in the south the general liu yu secured the abdication of the jin in favor of the liu song the various successors of these states became known as the northern and southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the sui in 581 the sui restored the han to power through china reformed its agriculture and economy constructed the grand canal and patronized buddhism however they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war with korea provoked widespread unrest.7374 the 13th century brought the mongol conquest of china in 1271 the mongol leader kublai khan established the yuan dynasty the yuan conquered the last remnant of the song dynasty in 1279 before the mongol invasion the population of song china was 120 million citizens this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.83 a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan in 1368 and founded the ming dynasty as the hongwu emperor under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture it was during this period that zheng he led treasure voyages throughout the world reaching as far as africa.84 in 1644 beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by li zicheng the chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui overthrew li's short-lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynasty end of dynastic rule on 1 january 1912 the republic of china was established and sun yat-sen of the kuomintang the kmt or nationalist party was proclaimed provisional president.94 however the presidency was later given to yuan shikai a former qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself emperor of china in the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own beiyang army he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic.95 after yuan shikai's death in 1916 china was politically fragmented its beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory.9697 in the late 1920s the kuomintang under chiang kai-shek the then principal of the republic of china military academy was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings known collectively as the northern expedition.9899 the kuomintang moved the nation's capital to nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in sun yat-sen's san-min program for transforming china into a modern democratic state.100101 the political division in china made it difficult for chiang to battle the communist people's liberation army pla against whom the kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the chinese civil war this war continued successfully for the kuomintang especially after the pla retreated in the long march until japanese aggression and the 1936 xi'an incident forced chiang to confront imperial japan.102 major combat in the chinese civil war ended in 1949 with the communist party in control of most of mainland china and the kuomintang retreating offshore reducing the roc's territory to only taiwan hainan and their surrounding islands on 21 september 1949 communist party chairman mao zedong proclaimed the establishment of the people's republic of china.789 this was followed by a mass celebration in tiananmen square on 1 october which became the new country's first national day in 1950 the people's liberation army succeeded in capturing hainan from the roc111 and incorporating tibet.112 however remaining kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western china throughout the 1950s.113 in modern us history studies the founding of prc china is often termed as the loss of china as reflected in us state policy documents of the time which thinkers such as chomsky call the beginning of mccarthyism.114 after mao's death the gang of four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping took power in 1978 and instituted significant economic reforms the communist party loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of private land leases this marked china's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment.120 china adopted its current constitution on 4 december 1982 in 1989 the violent suppression of student protests in tiananmen square brought condemnation and sanctions against the chinese government from various countries.121 geography political geography landscape and climate china's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer in the winter northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.145 the climate in china differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex topography biodiversity china is one of 17 megadiverse countries150 lying in two of the world's major ecozones the palearctic and the indomalaya by one measure china has over 34687 species of animals and vascular plants making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world after brazil and colombia.151 the country signed the rio de janeiro convention on biological diversity on 11 june 1992 and became a party to the convention on 5 january 1993.152 it later produced a national biodiversity strategy and action plan with one revision that was received by the convention on 21 september 2010.153 china is home to at least 551 species of mammals the third-highest such number in the world154 1221 species of birds eighth155 424 species of reptiles seventh156 and 333 species of amphibians seventh.157 china is the most biodiverse country in each category outside the tropics wildlife in china share habitat with and bear acute pressure from the world's largest population of homo sapiens at least 840 animal species are threatened vulnerable or in danger of local extinction in china due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction pollution and poaching for food fur and ingredients for traditional chinese medicine.158 endangered wildlife is protected by law and as of 2005update the country has over 2349 nature reserves covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares 15 percent of china's total land area.159 china has over 32000 species of vascular plants160 and is home to a variety of forest types cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country supporting animal species such as moose and asian black bear along with over 120 bird species.161 the understorey of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo in higher montane stands of juniper and yew the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons subtropical forests which are predominate in central and southern china support as many as 146000 species of flora.161 tropical and seasonal rainforests though confined to yunnan and hainan island contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in china.161 china has over 10000 recorded species of fungi162 and of them nearly 6000 are higher fungi.163 environmental issues in recent decades china has suffered from severe environmental deterioration and pollution.164165 while regulations such as the 1979 environmental protection law are fairly stringent they are poorly enforced as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development.166 urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country the world bank estimated in 2013 that 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities are located in china.167 china is the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter.168 the country also has significant water pollution problems 40 of china's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011.169 in 2014 the internal freshwater resources per capita of china reduced to 2062m3 and it was below 500m3 in the north china plain while 5920m3 in the world.170171172 politics china's constitution states that the people's republic of china is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants and that the state organs apply the principle of democratic centralism.184 the prc is one of the world's few remaining socialist states openly endorsing communism see ideology of the communist party of china the chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist but also as authoritarian and corporatist185 with heavy restrictions in many areas most notably against free access to the internet freedom of the press freedom of assembly the right to have children free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion.186 its current political ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as the people's democratic dictatorship socialism with chinese characteristics which is marxism adapted to chinese circumstances and the socialist market economy respectively.187 communist party china's constitution declares that the country is ruled under the leadership of the communist party of china cpc.188 as china is a de facto one-party state the general secretary party leader holds ultimate power and authority over state and government serving as the paramount leader.189 the electoral system is pyramidal local people's congresses are directly elected and higher levels of people's congresses up to the national people's congress npc are indirectly elected by the people's congress of the level immediately below.190 the political system is decentralized and provincial and sub-provincial leaders have a significant amount of autonomy.191 another eight political parties have representatives in the npc and the chinese people's political consultative conference cppcc.192 china supports the leninist principle of democratic centralism193 but critics describe the elected national people's congress as a rubber stamp body.194 government the president of china is the titular head of state serving as the ceremonial figurehead under national people's congress the premier of china is the head of government presiding over the state council composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions the incumbent president is xi jinping who is also the general secretary of the communist party of china and the chairman of the central military commission making him china's paramount leader.195 the incumbent premier is li keqiang who is also a senior member of the cpc politburo standing committee china's de facto top decision-making body.196130 administrative divisions the people's republic of china is divided into 22 provinces five autonomous regions each with a designated minority group four municipalities and two special administrative regions sars which enjoy a degree of political autonomy these 31 provincial-level divisions can be collectively referred to as mainland china a term which usually excludes two sars of hong kong and macau geographically all 31 provincial divisions can be grouped into six regions including north china northeast china east china south central china southwest china and northwest china china considers taiwan to be its 23rd province although taiwan is governed by the republic of china which disputes the prc's claim.202 none of the divisions are recognized by the roc government which claims the entirety of the prc's territory foreign relations the prc has diplomatic relations with 175 countries and maintains embassies in 162 its legitimacy is disputed by the republic of china and a few other countries it is thus the largest and most populous state with limited recognition in 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china as the sole representative of china in the united nations and as one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council.203 china was also a former member and leader of the non-aligned movement and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries.204 along with brazil russia india and south africa china is a member of the brics group of emerging major economies and hosted the group's third official summit at sanya hainan in april 2011.205 under its interpretation of the one-china policy beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the republic of china chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to taiwan206 especially in the matter of armament sales.207 much of current chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on premier zhou enlai's five principles of peaceful coexistence and is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.208 this policy may have led china to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by western nations such as zimbabwe north korea and iran.209 china has a close economic and military relationship with russia210 and the two states often vote in unison in the un security council.211212213 trade relations in recent decades china has played an increasing role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its asia-pacific neighbours china became a member of the world trade organization wto on 11 december 2001 in 2004 it proposed an entirely new east asia summit eas framework as a forum for regional security issues.214 the eas which includes asean plus three india australia and new zealand held its inaugural summit in 2005 china is also a founding member of the shanghai cooperation organization sco along with russia and the central asian republics in 2000 the united states congress approved permanent normal trade relations pntr with china allowing chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.215 china has a significant trade surplus with the united states its most important export market.216 in the early 2010s us politicians argued that the chinese yuan was significantly undervalued giving china an unfair trade advantage.217218219 in recent decades china has followed a policy of engaging with african nations for trade and bilateral co-operation;220221222 in 2012 sino-african trade totalled over us$160 billion.223 china has furthermore strengthened its ties with major south american economies becoming the largest trading partner of brazil and building strategic links with argentina.224225 territorial disputes ever since its establishment after the second chinese civil war the prc has claimed the territories governed by the republic of china roc a separate political entity today commonly known as taiwan as a part of its territory it regards the island of taiwan as its taiwan province kinmen and matsu as a part of fujian province and islands the roc controls in the south china sea as a part of hainan province and guangdong province these claims are controversial because of the complicated cross-strait relations with the prc treating the one-china policy as one of its most important diplomatic principles.226 in addition to taiwan china is also involved in other international territorial disputes since the 1990s china has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders including a disputed border with india and an undefined border with bhutan china is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the east and south china seas such as the senkaku islands and the scarborough shoal.227228 on 21 may 2014 xi jinping speaking at a conference in shanghai pledged to settle china's territorial disputes peacefully china stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests he said.229 emerging superpower status china is regularly hailed as a potential new superpower with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress growing military might very large population and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century.24230 others however warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt china's growth as the century progresses.231232 some authors also question the definition of superpower arguing that china's large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower and noting that it lacks the military power and cultural influence of the united states.233 sociopolitical issues human rights and reform the chinese democracy movement social activists and some members of the communist party of china have all identified the need for social and political reform while economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in china since the 1970s political freedom is still tightly restricted the constitution of the people's republic of china states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights however in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.234235 although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling communist party are tolerated censorship of political speech and information most notably on the internet236237 are routinely used to prevent collective action.238 in 2005 reporters without borders ranked china 159th out of 167 states in its annual world press freedom index indicating a very low level of press freedom.239 in 2014 china ranked 175th out of 180 countries.240 rural migrants to china's cities often find themselves treated as second-class citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits.241242 property rights are often poorly protected241 and taxation disproportionately affects poorer citizens.242 however a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s and additional social services provided to rural dwellers.243244 a number of foreign governments foreign press agencies and ngos also routinely criticize china's human rights record alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial forced abortions245 forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights186246 and excessive use of the death penalty.247248 the government has suppressed popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to social stability as was the case with the tiananmen square protests of 1989 falun gong was first taught publicly in 1992 in 1999 when there were 70 million practitioners249 the persecution of falun gong began resulting in mass arrests extralegal detention and reports of torture and deaths in custody.250251 the chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in tibet and xinjiang including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression.252253 the chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present level of economic development.254 it emphasizes the rise in the chinese standard of living literacy rate and average life expectancy since the 1970s as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial yangtze river floods.254255256 furthermore some chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization although others remain more conservative.257 some major reform efforts have been conducted for an instance in november 2013 the government announced plans to relax the one-child policy and abolish the much-criticized re-education through labour program138 though human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic.250 during the 2000s and early 2010s the chinese government was increasingly tolerant of ngos that offer practical efficient solutions to social problems but such third sector activity remained heavily regulated.258259 military with 2.3 million active troops the people's liberation army pla is the largest standing military force in the world commanded by the central military commission cmc.260 the pla consists of the ground force plagf the navy plan the air force plaaf and the people's liberation army rocket force plarf according to the chinese government china's military budget for 2014 totalled us$132 billion constituting the world's second-largest military budget although the military expenditures-gdp ratio is below world average.22 however many authorities  including sipri and the u.s office of the secretary of defense  argue that china does not report its real level of military spending which is allegedly much higher than the official budget.22261 as a recognized nuclear weapons state china is considered both a major regional military power and a potential military superpower.262 according to a 2013 report by the us department of defense china fields between 50 and 75 nuclear icbms along with a number of srbms.21 however compared with the other four un security council permanent members china has relatively limited power projection capabilities.263 to offset this it has developed numerous power projection assets since the early 2000s  its first aircraft carrier entered service in 2012264265266 and it maintains a substantial fleet of submarines including several nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines.267 china has furthermore established a network of foreign military relationships along critical sea lanes.268 economy china had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.284285 as of 2014update china has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal gdp totalling approximately us$10.380 trillion according to the international monetary fund.16 in terms of purchasing power parity ppp gdp china's economy is the largest in the world with a 2014 ppp gdp of us$17.617 trillion.16 in 2013 its ppp gdp per capita was us$12880 while its nominal gdp per capita was us$7589 both cases put china behind around eighty countries out of 183 countries on the imf list in global gdp per capita rankings.286 economic history and growth since economic liberalization began in 1978 china has been among the world's fastest-growing economies294 relying largely on investment and export-led growth.295 according to the imf china's annual average gdp growth between 2001 and 2010 was 10.5% between 2007 and 2011 china's economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the g7 countries growth combined.296 according to the global growth generators index announced by citigroup in february 2011 china has a very high 3g growth rating.297 its high productivity low labor costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing however the chinese economy is highly energy-intensive and inefficient;298 china became the world's largest energy consumer in 2010299 relies on coal to supply over 70 of its energy needs and surpassed the us to become the world's largest oil importer in september 2013.300301 in the early 2010s china's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles weakening international demand for chinese exports and fragility in the global economy.302303304 in the online realm china's e-commerce industry has grown more slowly than the eu and the us with a significant period of development occurring from around 2009 onwards according to credit suisse the total value of online transactions in china grew from an insignificant size in 2008 to around rmb 4 trillion us$660 billion in 2012 the chinese online payment market is dominated by major firms such as alipay tenpay and china unionpay.305 china in the global economy china ranked 29th in the global competitiveness index in 2009321 although it is only ranked 136th among the 179 countries measured in the 2011 index of economic freedom.322 in 2014 fortune's global 500 list of the world's largest corporations included 95 chinese companies with combined revenues of us$5.8 trillion.323 the same year forbes reported that five of the world's ten largest public companies were chinese including the world's largest bank by total assets the industrial and commercial bank of china.324 class and income inequality internationalization of the renminbi following the 2008 global financial crisis china realized the dependency on the us dollar and the weakness of the international monetary system.338 the rmb internationalization accelerated in 2009 when china established dim sum bond market and expanded the cross-border trade rmb settlement pilot project which helps establish pools of offshore rmb liquidity.339340 in november 2010 russia began using the chinese renminbi in its bilateral trade with china.341 this was soon followed by japan342 australia343 singapore344 the united kingdom345 and canada.346 as a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world in 2013.347 science and technology historical china was once a world leader in science and technology until the ming dynasty ancient chinese discoveries and inventions such as papermaking printing the compass and gunpowder the four great inventions became widespread in asia and later to the europe chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers.348349 by the 17th century the western world had surpassed china in scientific and technological development.350 the causes of this great divergence continue to be debated.351 after repeated military defeats by western nations in the 19th century chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the self-strengthening movement after the communists came to power in 1949 efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the soviet union in which scientific research was part of central planning.352 after mao's death in 1976 science and technology was established as one of the four modernizations353 and the soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.354 modern era since the end of the cultural revolution china has made significant investments in scientific research355 with $163 billion spent on scientific research and development in 2012.356 science and technology are seen as vital for achieving china's economic and political goals and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as techno-nationalism.357 nonetheless china's investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the united states and japan.355356 chinese-born scientists have won the nobel prize in physics four times the nobel prize in chemistry and physiology or medicine once respectively though most of these scientists conducted their nobel-winning research in western nations.s china is developing its education system with an emphasis on science mathematics and engineering in 2009 china graduated over 10000 ph.d engineers and as many as 500000 bsc graduates more than any other country.363 china is also the world's second-largest publisher of scientific papers producing 121500 in 2010 alone including 5200 in leading international scientific journals.364 chinese technology companies such as huawei and lenovo have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing365366367 and chinese supercomputers are consistently ranked among the world's most powerful.368369 china is also expanding its use of industrial robots from 2008 to 2011 the installation of multi-role robots in chinese factories rose by 136 percent.370 the chinese space program is one of the world's most active and is a major source of national pride.371372 in 1970 china launched its first satellite dong fang hong i becoming the fifth country to do so independently.373 in 2003 china became the third country to independently send humans into space with yang liwei's spaceflight aboard shenzhou 5 as of 2015update ten chinese nationals have journeyed into space including two women in 2011 china's first space station module tiangong-1 was launched marking the first step in a project to assemble a large manned station by the early 2020s.374 in 2013 china successfully landed the chang'e 3 lander and yutu rover onto the lunar surface china plans to collect lunar soil samples by 2017.375 infrastructure telecommunications china currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country in the world with over 1 billion users by february 2012.376 it also has the world's largest number of internet and broadband users377 with over 688 million internet users as of 2016update equivalent to around half of its population.378 the national average broadband connection speed is 9.46 mbit/s ranking china 91st in the world in terms of internet speed.378 as of july 2013 china accounts for 24 of the world's internet-connected devices.379 since 2011 china is the nation with the most installed telecommunication bandwidth in the world by 2014 china hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential than the u.s. the historical leader in terms of installed telecommunication bandwidth china 29 versus us:13 of the global total.380 china telecom and china unicom the world's two largest broadband providers accounted for 20 of global broadband subscribers china telecom alone serves more than 50 million broadband subscribers while china unicom serves more than 40 million.381 several chinese telecommunications companies most notably huawei and zte have been accused of spying for the chinese military.382 china is developing its own satellite navigation system dubbed beidou which began offering commercial navigation services across asia in 2012383 and is planned to offer global coverage by 2020.384 transport since 2000 the growth of rapid transit systems in chinese cities has accelerated as of january 2016 26 chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation and 39 more have metro systems approved400 with a dozen more to join them by 2020.401 the shanghai metro beijing subway guangzhou metro hong kong mtr and shenzhen metro are among the longest and busiest in the world there were 182 commercial airports in china in 2012 with 82 new airports planned to open by 2015 more than two-thirds of the airports under construction worldwide in 2013 were in china402 and boeing expects that china's fleet of active commercial aircraft in china will grow from 1910 in 2011 to 5980 in 2031.402 with rapid expansion in civil aviation the largest airports in china have also joined the ranks of the busiest in the world in 2013 beijing's capital airport ranked second in the world by passenger traffic it was 26th in 2002 since 2010 the hong kong international airport and shanghai pudong international airport have ranked first and third in air cargo tonnage some 80 of china's airspace remains restricted for military use and chinese airlines made up eight of the 10 worst-performing asian airlines in terms of delays.403 china has over 2000 river and seaports about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping in 2012 the ports of shanghai hong kong shenzhen ningbo-zhoushan guangzhou qingdao tianjin dalian ranked in the top in the world in container traffic and cargo tonnage.404 water supply and sanitation demographics the national census of 2010 recorded the population of the people's republic of china as approximately 1370536875 about 16.60 of the population were 14 years old or younger 70.14 were between 15 and 59 years old and 13.26 were over 60 years old.409 the population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.410 although a middle-income country by western standards china's rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty since 1978 today about 10 of the chinese population lives below the poverty line of us$1 per day down from 64 in 1978 in 2014 the urban unemployment rate of china was about 4.1%.411412 with a population of around 1.4 billion and dwindling natural resources the government of china is very concerned about its population growth rate and has attempted since 1979 with mixed results413 to implement a strict family planning policy known as the one-child policy. before 2013 this policy sought to restrict families to one child each with exceptions for ethnic minorities

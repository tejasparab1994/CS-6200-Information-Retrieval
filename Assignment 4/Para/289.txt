arabic during the middle ages literary arabic was a major vehicle of culture in europe especially in science mathematics and philosophy as a result many european languages have also borrowed many words from it arabic influence mainly in vocabulary is seen in european languages mainly spanish and to a lesser extent portuguese valencian and catalan owing to both the proximity of christian european and muslim arab civilizations and 800 years of arabic culture and language in the iberian peninsula referred to in arabic as al-andalus sicilian has about 500 arabic words as result of sicily being progressively conquered by saracens from north africa from the mid 9th to mid 10th centuries many of these words relate to agriculture and related activities hull and ruffino balkan languages including greek and bulgarian have also acquired a significant number of arabic words through contact with ottoman turkish arabic has influenced many languages around the globe throughout its history some of the most influenced languages are persian turkish spanish maltese urdu kashmiri kurdish bosnian kazakh bengali hindi malay maldivian indonesian pashto punjabi tagalog sindhi and hausa and some languages in parts of africa conversely arabic has borrowed words from other languages including greek and persian in medieval times and contemporary european languages such as english and french in modern times classical arabic is the liturgical language of 1.7 billion muslims and modern standard arabic is one of six official languages of the united nations.6789 it is spoken by perhaps as many as 422 million speakers native and non-native in the arab world2 making it the fifth most spoken language in the world arabic is written with the arabic alphabet which is an abjad script and is written from right to left although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ascii latin from left to right with no standardized orthography  contents  classificationedit there are several features which classical arabic the modern arabic varieties as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hijaz these features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor proto-arabic the following features can be reconstructed with confidence for proto-arabic:10 historyedit old arabicedit arabia boasted a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity in the southwest various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside of the ancient south arabian family e.g southern thamudic were spoken it is also believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages non-central semitic languages were also spoken in southern arabia at this time to the north in the oases of northern hijaz dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages in najd and parts of western arabia a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested in eastern arabia inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as hasaitic finally on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic b thamudic d safaitic and hismaic are attested the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are in fact early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old arabic.11 beginning in the 1st century ce fragments of northern old arabic are attested in the nabataean script across northern arabia by the 4th century ce the nabataean aramaic writing system had come to express varieties of arabic other than that of the nabataeans old hijazi and classical arabicedit neo-arabicedit charles ferguson's koine theory ferguson 1959 claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests this view has been challenged in recent times ahmad al-jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests northern and central al-jallad 2009 the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories.13 according to veersteegh and bickerton colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and msa.1415 classical modern standard and spoken arabicedit some of the differences between classical arabic ca and modern standard arabic msa are as follows colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties which constitute the everyday spoken language and evolved from classical arabic colloquial arabic has many regional variants geographically distant varieties usually differ enough to be mutually unintelligible and some linguists consider them distinct languages.17 the varieties are typically unwritten they are often used in informal spoken media such as soap operas and talk shows18 as well as occasionally in certain forms of written media such as poetry and printed advertising the only variety of modern arabic to have acquired official language status is maltese which is spoken in predominately catholic malta and written with the latin script it is descended from classical arabic through siculo-arabic but is not mutually intelligible with any other variety of arabic most linguists list it as a separate language rather than as a dialect of arabic language and dialectedit the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia which is the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught standard arabic as well as their native mutually unintelligible dialects;1920212223 these dialects linguistically constitute separate languages which may have dialects of their own.24 when educated arabs of different dialects engage in conversation for example a moroccan speaking with a lebanese many speakers code-switch back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film the issue of whether arabic is one language or many languages is politically charged in the same way it is for the varieties of chinese hindi and urdu serbian and croatian scots and english etc in contrast to speakers of hindi and urdu who claim they cannot understand each other even when they can speakers of the varieties of arabic will claim they can all understand each other even when they cannot.25 the issue of diglossia between spoken and written language is a significant complicating factor a single written form significantly different from any of the spoken varieties learned natively unites a number of sometimes divergent spoken forms for political reasons arabs mostly assert that they all speak a single language despite significant issues of mutual incomprehensibility among differing spoken versions.26 influence of arabic on other languagesedit the influence of arabic has been most important in islamic countries because it is the language of the islamic sacred book the quran arabic is also an important source of vocabulary for languages such as baluchi bengali berber bosnian catalan chechen dagestani english french german gujarati hausa hindustani italian indonesian kazakh kurdish kutchi malay pashto persian portuguese punjabi rohingya saraiki sicilian sindhi somali spanish swahili tagalog turkish uzbek and wolof as well as other languages in countries where these languages are spoken.citation needed in addition english has many arabic loanwords some directly but most via other mediterranean languages examples of such words include admiral adobe alchemy alcohol algebra algorithm alkaline almanac amber arsenal assassin candy carat cipher coffee cotton ghoul hazard jar kismet lemon loofah magazine mattress sherbet sofa sumac tariff and many other words.citation needed other languages such as maltese28 and kinubi derive ultimately from arabic rather than merely borrowing vocabulary or grammatical rules in languages not directly in contact with the arab world arabic loanwords are often transferred indirectly via other languages rather than being transferred directly from arabic for example most arabic loanwords in hindustani and turkish entered through persian though persian is an indo-iranian language older arabic loanwords in hausa were borrowed from kanuri since throughout the islamic world arabic occupied a position similar to that of latin in europe many of the arabic concepts in the fields of science philosophy commerce etc were coined from arabic roots by non-native arabic speakers notably by aramaic and persian translators and then found their way into other languages this process of using arabic roots especially in kurdish and persian to translate foreign concepts continued through to the 18th and 19th centuries when swaths of arab-inhabited lands were under ottoman rule influence of other languages on arabicedit arabic alphabet and nationalismedit there have been many instances of national movements to convert arabic script into latin script or to romanize the language currently the only arabic language to use latin script is maltese lebanonedit the beirut newspaper la syrie pushed for the change from arabic script to latin letters in 1922 the major head of this movement was louis massignon a french orientalist who brought his concern before the arabic language academy in damacus in 1928 massignon's attempt at romanization failed as the academy and population viewed the proposal as an attempt from the western world to take over their country sa'id afghani a member of the academy mentioned that the movement to romanize the script was a zionist plan to dominate lebanon.3233 egyptedit after the period of colonialism in egypt egyptians were looking for a way to reclaim and re-emphasize egyptian culture as a result some egyptians pushed for an egyptianization of the arabic language in which the formal arabic and the colloquial arabic would be combined into one language and the latin alphabet would be used.3233 there was also the idea of finding a way to use hieroglyphics instead of the latin alphabet but this was seen as too complicated to use.3233 a scholar salama musa agreed with the idea of applying a latin alphabet to arabic as he believed that would allow egypt to have a closer relationship with the west he also believed that latin script was key to the success of egypt as it would allow for more advances in science and technology this change in alphabet he believed would solve the problems inherent with arabic such as a lack of written vowels and difficulties writing foreign words that made it difficult for non-native speakers to learn.3233 ahmad lutfi as sayid and muhammad azmi two egyptian intellectuals agreed with musa and supported the push for romanization.3234 the idea that romanization was necessary for modernization and growth in egypt continued with abd al-aziz fahmi in 1944 he was the chairman for the writing and grammar committee for the arabic language academy of cairo.3234 however this effort failed as the egyptian people felt a strong cultural tie to the arabic alphabet.3234 in particular the older egyptian generations believed that the arabic alphabet had strong connections to arab values and history which is easy to believe due to the long history of the arabic alphabet shrivtiel 189 in muslim societies the language of the quran and its influence on poetryedit the quran introduced a new way of writing to the world people began studying applying the unique styles they learned from the quran into not only their own writing but also their culture the deep level on which the quran addresses the reader creates a strong bond and connection to the reader's soul writers studied the unique structure and format of the quran in order to identify and apply the figurative devices and their impact on the reader quran's figurative devicesedit the quran inspired musicality in poetry through the internal rhythm of the verses the arrangement of words how certain sounds create harmony and the agreement of rhymes create the sense of rhythm within each verse at times the chapters of the quran only have the rhythm in common.35 the repetition in the quran introduced the true power and impact repetition can have in poetry the repetition of certain words and phrases made them appear more firm and explicit in the quran the quran uses constant metaphors of blindness and deafness to imply unbelief metaphors were not a new concept to poetry however the strength of extended metaphors was the explicit imagery in the quran inspired many poets to include and focus on the feature in their own work the poet ibn al mu'tazz wrote a book regarding the figures of speech inspired by his study of the quran opoets such as badr shakir al sayyab expresses his political opinion in his work through imagery inspired by the forms of more harsher imagery used in the quran.36 the quran uses figurative devices in order to express the meaning in the most beautiful form possible the study of the pauses in the quran as well as other rhetoric allow it to be approached in a multiple ways.37 structureedit although the quran is known for its fluency and harmony the structure can be best described as chaotic the suras also known as verses of the quran are not placed in chronological order the only constant in their structure is that the longest are placed first and shorter ones follow the topics discussed in the chapter often have no relation to each other and only share their sense of rhyme the quran introduces to poetry the idea of abandoning order and scattering narratives throughout the text harmony is also present in the sound of the quran the elongations and accents present in the quran create a harmonious flow within the writing unique sound of the quran recited due to the accents create a deeper level of understanding through a deeper emotional connection.36 the quran is written in a language that is simple and understandable by people the simplicity of the writing inspired later poets to write in a more clear and clear-cut style.36 the words of the quran although unchanged are to this day understandable and frequently used in both formal and informal arabic the simplicity of the language makes memorizing and reciting the quran a slightly easier task culture and the quranedit the writer al-khattabi explains how culture is a required element to create a sense of art in work as well as understand it he believes that fluency and harmony the quran possess are not the only elements that make it beautiful and create a bond between the reader and the text while a lot of poetry was deemed comparable to the quran in that it is equal to or better than the composition of the quran a debate rose that such statements are not possible because humans are incapable of composing work comparable to the quran.37 because the structure of the quran made it difficult for a clear timeline to be seen hadith were the main source of chronological order the hadith were passed down from generation to generation and this tradition became a large resource for understanding the context poetry after the quran began possessing this element of tradition by including ambiguity and background information to be required to understand the meaning.35 after the quran came down to the people the tradition of memorizing the verses became present it is believed that the larger amount of the quran memorized is a sign of a stronger faith as technology improved overtime hearing recitations of quran became more available as well as more tools to help memorize the versus the tradition of love poetry served as a symbolic representation of a muslim's desire for a closer contact with their lord while the influence of the quran on arabic poetry is explained and defended by numerous writers some writers such as al baqillani believe that poetry and the quran are in no conceivable way related due to the uniqueness of the quran poetry's imperfections prove his points that that they cannot be compared with the fluency the quran holds arabic and islamedit classical arabic is the language of poetry and literature including news it is also mainly the language of the quran at present modern standard arabic msa is also used in modernized versions of literary forms of the quran arabic is closely associated with the religion of islam because the quran was written in arabic but it is nevertheless also spoken by other religious groups such as arab christians mizrahi jews druze and iraqi mandaeans most of the world's muslims do not speak classical arabic as their native language but many can read the quranic script and recite the quran among non-arab muslims translations of the quran are most often accompanied by the original text some muslims present a monogenesis of languages and claim that the arabic language was the language revealed by god for the benefit of mankind and the original language as a prototype system of symbolic communication based upon its system of triconsonantal roots spoken by man from which all other languages were derived having first been corrupted.3839 judaism has a similar account with the tower of babel dialects and descendantsedit colloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken dialects of arabic used throughout the arab world which differ radically from the literary language the main dialectal division is between the varieties within and outside of the arabian peninsula followed by that between sedentary varieties and the much more conservative bedouin varieties all of the varieties outside of the arabian peninsula which include the large majority of speakers have a large number of features in common with each other that are not found in classical arabic this has led researchers to postulate the existence of a prestige koine dialect in the one or two centuries immediately following the arab conquest whose features eventually spread to all of the newly conquered areas these features are present to varying degrees inside the arabian peninsula generally the arabian peninsula varieties have much more diversity than the non-peninsula varieties but have been understudied. within the non-peninsula varieties the largest difference is between the non-egyptian north african dialects especially moroccan arabic and the others moroccan arabic in particular is hardly comprehensible to arabic speakers east of libya although the converse is not true in part due to the popularity of egyptian films and other media examplesedit transcription is a broad ipa transcription so minor differences were ignored for easier comparison also the pronunciation of modern standard arabic differs significantly from region to region koineedit according to charles a ferguson40 the following are some of the characteristic features of the koine that underlies all of the modern dialects outside the arabian peninsula although many other features are common to most or all of these varieties ferguson believes that these features in particular are unlikely to have evolved independently more than once or twice and together suggest the existence of the koine dialect groupsedit phonologyedit historyedit other changes may also have happened classical arabic pronunciation is not thoroughly recorded and different reconstructions of the sound system of proto-semitic propose different phonetic values one example is the emphatic consonants which are pharyngealized in modern pronunciations but may have been velarized in the eighth century and glottalized in proto-semitic.47 reduction of /j and /w between vowels occurs in a number of circumstances and is responsible for much of the complexity of third-weak defective verbs early akkadian transcriptions of arabic names shows that this reduction had not yet occurred as of the early part of the 1st millennium bc literary arabicedit the colloquial spoken varieties of arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of arabic speakers formal literary arabic usually specifically modern standard arabic is learned at school although many speakers have a native-like command of the language it is technically not the native language of any speakers both varieties can be both written and spoken although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances e.g. in radio broadcasts formal lectures parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial varieties even when the literary language is spoken however it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud when speaking extemporaneously i.e making up the language on the spot as in a normal discussion among people speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties in fact there is a continuous range of in-between spoken varieties from nearly pure modern standard arabic msa to a form that still uses msa grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in msa to a form that is close to pure colloquial but with the rough edges the most noticeably vulgar or non-classical aspects smoothed out to pure colloquial the particular variant or register used depends on the social class and education level of the speakers involved and the level of formality of the speech situation often it will vary within a single encounter e.g. moving from nearly pure msa to a more mixed language in the process of a radio interview as the interviewee becomes more comfortable with the interviewer this type of variation is characteristic of the diglossia that exists throughout the arabic-speaking world vowelsedit consonantsedit syllable structureedit stressedit word stress is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic it bears a strong relationship to vowel length the basic rules for modern standard arabic are these rules may result in differently stressed syllables when final case endings are pronounced vs the normal situation where they are not pronounced as in the above example of mak-ta-ba-tun 'library in full pronunciation but mak-ta-ba-tun 'library in short pronunciation the restriction on final long vowels does not apply to the spoken dialects where original final long vowels have been shortened and secondary final long vowels have arisen from loss of original final -hu/hi levels of pronunciationedit the final short vowels e.g. the case endings -a -i -u and mood endings -u -a are often not pronounced in this language despite forming part of the formal paradigm of nouns and verbs the following levels of pronunciation exist this is the most formal level actually used in speech all endings are pronounced as written except at the end of an utterance where the following changes occur this is a formal level of pronunciation sometimes seen it is somewhat like pronouncing all words as if they were in pausal position with influence from the colloquial varieties the following changes occur this is the pronunciation used by speakers of modern standard arabic in extemporaneous speech i.e when producing new sentences rather than simply reading a prepared text it is similar to formal short pronunciation except that the rules for dropping final vowels apply even when a clitic suffix is added basically short-vowel case and mood endings are never pronounced and certain other changes occur that echo the corresponding colloquial pronunciations specifically colloquial varietiesedit vowelsedit consonantsedit grammaredit literary arabicedit from a single root k-t-b numerous words can be formed by applying different patterns nouns and adjectivesedit adjectives in literary arabic are marked for case number gender and state as for nouns however the plural of all non-human nouns is always combined with a singular feminine adjective which takes the /-ah or /-at suffix nouns verbs pronouns and adjectives agree with each other in all respects however non-human plural nouns are grammatically considered to be feminine singular furthermore a verb in a verb-initial sentence is marked as singular regardless of its semantic number when the subject of the verb is explicitly mentioned as a noun numerals between three and ten show chiasmic agreement in that grammatically masculine numerals have feminine marking and vice versa verbsedit verbs in literary arabic are marked for person first second or third gender and number they are conjugated in two major paradigms past and non-past two voices active and passive and six moods indicative imperative subjunctive jussive shorter energetic and longer energetic the fifth and sixth moods the energetics exist only in classical arabic but not in msa.54 there are also two participles active and passive and a verbal noun but no infinitive the past and non-past paradigms are sometimes also termed perfective and imperfective indicating the fact that they actually represent a combination of tense and aspect the moods other than the indicative occur only in the non-past and the future tense is signaled by prefixing sa or sawfa onto the non-past the past and non-past differ in the form of the stem e.g. past katab vs non-past -ktub- and also use completely different sets of affixes for indicating person number and gender in the past the person number and gender are fused into a single suffixal morpheme while in the non-past a combination of prefixes primarily encoding person and suffixes primarily encoding gender and number are used the passive voice uses the same person/number/gender affixes but changes the vowels of the stem the following shows a paradigm of a regular arabic verb kataba 'to write' note that in modern standard the energetic mood in either long or short form which have the same meaning is almost never used derivationedit like other semitic languages and unlike most other languages arabic makes much more use of nonconcatenative morphology applying a large number of templates applied roots to derive words than adding prefixes or suffixes to words for verbs a given root can occur in many different derived verb stems of which there are about fifteen each with one or more characteristic meanings and each with its own templates for the past and non-past stems active and passive participles and verbal noun these are referred to by western scholars as form i form ii and so on through form xv although forms xi to xv are rare these stems encode grammatical functions such as the causative intensive and reflexive stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs albeit often semantically related and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm as a result these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology not part of the inflectional system form ii is sometimes used to create transitive denominative verbs verbs built from nouns form v is the equivalent used for intransitive denominatives the only three genuine suffixes are as follows colloquial varietiesedit the spoken dialects have lost the case distinctions and make only limited use of the dual it occurs only on nouns and its use is no longer required in all circumstances they have lost the mood distinctions other than imperative but many have since gained new moods through the use of prefixes most often /bi- for indicative vs unmarked subjunctive they have also mostly lost the indefinite nunation and the internal passive the following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in egyptian arabic writing system edit calligraphyedit after khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi finally fixed the arabic script around 786 many styles were developed both for the writing down of the quran and other books and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration arabic calligraphy has not fallen out of use as calligraphy has in the western world and is still considered by arabs as a major art form calligraphers are held in great esteem being cursive by nature unlike the latin script arabic script is used to write down a verse of the quran a hadith or simply a proverb the composition is often abstract but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal one of the current masters of the genre is hassan massoudy in modern times the intrinsically calligraphic nature of the written arabic form is haunted by the thought that a typographic approach to the language necessary for digitized unification will not always accurately maintain meanings conveyed through calligraphy.56 romanizationedit during the last few decades and especially since the 1990s western-invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as personal computers the world wide web email bulletin board systems irc instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin script only and some of them still do not have the arabic script as an optional feature as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script sometimes known as im arabic numeralsedit language-standards regulatorsedit academy of the arabic language is the name of a number of language-regulation bodies formed in the arab league the most active are in damascus and cairo they review language development monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries they also publish old and historical arabic manuscripts as a foreign languageedit arabic has been taught worldwide in many elementary and secondary schools especially muslim schools universities around the world have classes that teach arabic as part of their foreign languages middle eastern studies and religious studies courses arabic language schools exist to assist students to learn arabic outside the academic world there are many arabic language schools in the arab world and other muslim countries because the quran is written in arabic and all islamic terms are in arabic millionscitation needed of muslims both arab and non-arab study the language software and books with tapes are also important part of arabic learning as many of arabic learners may live in places where there are no academic or arabic language school classes available radio series of arabic language classes are also provided from some radio stations.citation needed a number of websites on the internet provide online classes for all levels as a means of distance education most teach modern standard arabic but some teach regional varieties from numerous countries.58 arabic speakers and other languagesedit historically arab linguists considered the arabic language to be superior to all other languages and took almost no interest in learning any language other than arabiccitation needed with the sole example of medieval linguist abu hayyan al-gharnati  who while a scholar of the arabic language was not ethnically arab  scholars of the arabic language made no efforts at studying comparative linguistics considering all other languages inferior.59 see alsoedit referencesedit notes bibliography external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces

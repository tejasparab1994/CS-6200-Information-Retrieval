named after then duke of york and future king of england james ii james had been named by his older brother charles ii as proprietor of the former territory of new netherlands and its main city of new amsterdam which had recently been seized from the dutch early history in the precolonial era the area of present-day new york city was inhabited by algonquian native americans including the lenape whose homeland known as lenapehoking included staten island the western portion of long island including the area that would become brooklyn and queens manhattan the bronx and the lower hudson valley.81 in 1609 the english explorer henry hudson rediscovered the new york harbor while searching for the northwest passage to the orient for the dutch east india company he proceeded to sail up what the dutch would name the north river now the hudson river named first by hudson as the mauritius after maurice prince of orange hudson's first mate described the harbor as a very good harbour for all windes and the river as a mile broad and full of fish.84 hudson sailed roughly 150 miles north85 past the site of present-day albany in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue.84 he made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for the dutch east india company in 1614 the area between cape cod and delaware bay would be claimed by the netherlands and called nieuw-nederland new netherland dutch rule a permanent european presence in new netherland began in 1624  making new york the 12th oldest continuously occupied european-established settlement in the continental united states88  with the founding of a dutch fur trading settlement on governors island in 1625 construction was started on a citadel and fort amsterdam on manhattan island later called nieuw amsterdam new amsterdam.8990 the colony of new amsterdam was centered at the site which would eventually become lower manhattan in 1626 the dutch colonial director-general peter minuit acting as charged by the dutch west india company purchased the island of manhattan from the canarsie a small lenape band91 for 60 guilders92 about $1000 in 2006.93 a disproved legend claims that manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.9495 following the purchase new amsterdam grew slowly.96 to attract settlers the dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628 whereby wealthy dutchmen patroons or patrons who brought 50 colonists to new netherland would be awarded swathes of land along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade this program had little success.97 in 1647 peter stuyvesant began his tenure as the last director-general of new netherland during his tenure the population of new amsterdam grew from 2000 to 8000 stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony however he also earned a reputation as a despotic leader he instituted regulations on liquor sales attempted to assert control over the dutch reformed church and blocked other religious groups including quakers jews and lutherans from establishing houses of worship.99 the dutch west india company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between stuyvesant and residents of new amsterdam.100 english rule in 1664 unable to summon any significant resistance stuyvesant surrendered new amsterdam to english troops led by colonel richard nicolls without bloodshed.99100 the terms of the surrender permitted dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.101 the english promptly renamed the fledgling city new york after the duke of york the future king james ii of england.102 the transfer was confirmed in 1667 by the treaty of breda which

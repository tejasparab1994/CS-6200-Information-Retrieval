populous and the most densely populated of the 50 u.s states new jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of new york city and philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest state by median household income as of 2016.20 new jersey was inhabited by native americans for more than 2800 years with historical tribes such as the lenape along the coast in the early 17th century the dutch and the swedes made the first european settlements in the state.21 the english later seized control of the region22 naming it the province of new jersey after the largest of the channel islands jersey23 and granting it as a colony to sir george carteret and john berkeley 1st baron berkeley of stratton new jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the american revolutionary war in the 18th century in the 19th century factories in cities known as the big six24 camden paterson newark trenton jersey city and elizabeth helped to drive the industrial revolution new jersey's geographic location at the center of the northeast megalopolis between boston and new york city to the northeast and philadelphia baltimore and washington d.c. to the southwest fueled its rapid growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century in the first decades of the 21st century this suburbanization began reverting with the consolidation of new jersey's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings within the state2526 with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008.27  contents  history around 180 million years ago during the jurassic period new jersey bordered north africa the pressure of the collision between north america and africa gave rise to the appalachian mountains around 18000 years ago the ice age resulted in glaciers that reached new jersey as the glaciers retreated they left behind lake passaic as well as many rivers swamps and gorges.28 new jersey was originally settled by native americans with the lenni-lenape being dominant at the time of contact scheyichbi is the lenape name for the land that is now new jersey.29 the lenape were several autonomous groups that practiced maize agriculture in order to supplement their hunting and gathering in the region surrounding the delaware river the lower hudson river and western long island sound the lenape society was divided into matrilinear clans that were based upon common female ancestors these clans were organized into three distinct phratries identified by their animal sign turtle turkey and wolf they first encountered the dutch in the early 17th century and their primary relationship with the europeans was through fur trade colonial era the dutch became the first europeans to lay claim to lands in new jersey the dutch colony of new netherland consisted of parts of modern middle atlantic states although the european principle of land ownership was not recognized by the lenape dutch west india company policy required its colonists to purchase the land that they settled the first to do so was michiel pauw who established a patronship called pavonia in 1630 along the north river which eventually became the bergen peter minuit's purchase of lands along the delaware river established the colony of new sweden the entire region became a territory of england on june 24 1664 after an english fleet under the command of colonel richard nicolls sailed into what is today new york harbor and took control of fort amsterdam annexing the entire province during the english civil war the channel island of jersey remained loyal to the british crown and gave sanctuary to the king it was from the royal square in st helier that charles ii of england was proclaimed king in 1649 following the execution of his father charles i the north american lands were divided by charles ii who gave his brother the duke of york later king james ii the region between new england and maryland as a proprietary colony as opposed to a royal colony james then granted the land between the hudson river and the delaware river the land that would become new jersey to two friends who had remained loyal through the english civil war sir george carteret and lord berkeley of stratton.30 the area was named the province of new jersey settlement for the first 10 years of english rule took place along hackensack river and arthur kill  settlers came primarily from new york and new england on march 18 1673 berkeley sold his half of the colony to quakers in england who settled the delaware valley region as a quaker colony william penn acted as trustee for the lands for a time. new jersey was governed very briefly as two distinct provinces east and west jersey for 28 years between 1674 and 1702 at times part of the province of new york or dominion of new england in 1702 the two provinces were reunited under a royal governor rather than a proprietary one edward hyde lord cornbury became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony britain believed that he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler taking bribes and speculating on land in 1708 he was recalled to england new jersey was then ruled by the governors of new york but this infuriated the settlers of new jersey who accused those governors of favoritism to new york judge lewis morris led the case for a separate governor and was appointed governor by king george ii in 1738.31 revolutionary war era new jersey was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution the new jersey constitution of 1776 was passed july 2 1776 just two days before the second continental congress declared american independence from great britain it was an act of the provincial congress which made itself into the state legislature to reassure neutrals it provided that it would become void if new jersey reached reconciliation with great britain new jersey representatives richard stockton john witherspoon francis hopkinson john hart and abraham clark were among those who signed the united states declaration of independence during the american revolutionary war british and american armies crossed new jersey numerous times and several pivotal battles took place in the state because of this new jersey today is often referred to as the crossroads of the american revolution.32 the winter quarters of the continental army were established there twice by general george washington in morristown which has been called the military capital of the american revolution.33 american forces under washington met the forces under general henry clinton at the battle of monmouth in an indecisive engagement in june 1778 washington attempted to take the british column by surprise when the british army attempted to flank the americans the americans retreated in disorder the ranks were later reorganized and withstood the british charges in the summer of 1783 the continental congress met in nassau hall at princeton university making princeton the nation's capital for four months it was there that the continental congress learned of the signing of the treaty of paris 1783 which ended the war on december 18 1787 new jersey became the third state to ratify the united states constitution which was overwhelmingly popular in new jersey as it prevented new york and pennsylvania from charging tariffs on goods imported from europe on november 20 1789 the state became the first in the newly formed union to ratify the bill of rights the 1776 new jersey state constitution gave the vote to all inhabitants who had a certain level of wealth this included women and blacks but not married women because they could not own property separately from their husbands both sides in several elections claimed that the other side had had unqualified women vote and mocked them for use of petticoat electors whether entitled to vote or not on the other hand both parties passed voting rights acts in 1807 the legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal white male suffrage excluding paupers the constitution was itself an act of the legislature and not enshrined as the modern constitution.34 19th century on february 15 1804 new jersey became the last northern state to abolish new slavery and enacted legislation that slowly phased out existing slavery this led to a gradual decrease of the slave population by the close of the civil war about a dozen african americans in new jersey were still held in bondage.35 new jersey voters initially refused to ratify the constitutional amendments banning slavery and granting rights to the united states black population industrialization accelerated in the northern part of the state following completion of the morris canal in 1831 the canal allowed for coal to be brought from eastern pennsylvania's lehigh valley to northern new jersey's growing industries in paterson newark and jersey city in 1844 the second state constitution was ratified and brought into effect counties thereby became districts for the state senate and some realignment of boundaries including the creation of mercer county immediately followed this provision was retained in the 1947 constitution but was overturned by the supreme court of the united states in 1962 by the decision baker v carr while the governorship was stronger than under the 1776 constitution the constitution of 1844 created many offices that were not responsible to him or to the people and it gave him a three-year term but he could not succeed himself in the industrial revolution cities like paterson grew and prospered previously the economy had been largely agrarian which was problematically subject to crop failures and poor soil this caused a shift to a more industrialized economy one based on manufactured commodities such as textiles and silk inventor thomas edison also became an important figure of the industrial revolution

directing half of the legislative and all of the executive process in 2002 and 2007 president of the state senate richard codey held the position of acting governor for a short time and from 2004 to

lawsuits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is damages while the chancery division hears family cases civil suits where the plaintiff's primary remedy is equitable relief and probate trials the

the number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum and must consist of three five seven or nine members depending on the county the executive and legislative functions may be

series of six modern forms of government was implemented this began with the walsh act enacted in 1911 by the new jersey legislature which provided for a three or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis this was followed by the 1923 municipal manager law which offered a non-partisan council provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council and introduced a council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairs the faulkner act originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981 offers four basic plans mayor-council council-manager small municipality and mayor-council-administrator the act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government the number of seats on the council seats selected at-large by wards or through a combination of both staggered or concurrent terms of office and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters most large municipalities and a majority of new jersey's residents are governed by municipalities with faulkner act charters municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a special charter with the approval of the new jersey legislature.citation needed while municipalities retain their names derived from types of government they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public for example though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type loch arbour is the only one remaining with the village form of government the other three villages  ridgefield park now with a walsh act form ridgewood now with a faulkner act council-manager charter and south orange now operates under a special charter  have all migrated to other non-village forms.citation needed politics social attitudes and issues new jersey

democratic south including paterson the state's third-largest city and a rural republican north with the swing township of wayne in the middle other swing counties like monmouth county somerset county

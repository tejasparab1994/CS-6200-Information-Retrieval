infrared infrared was discovered in 1800 by astronomer sir william herschel who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light by means of its effect on a thermometer.6 slightly more than half of the total energy from the sun was eventually found to arrive on earth in the form of infrared the balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on earth's climate infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements it excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.7 infrared radiation is used in industrial scientific and medical applications night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds detect objects such as planets and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe.8 infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems to observe changing blood flow in the skin and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus  contents  definition and relationship to the electromagnetic spectrumedit natural infrarededit on the surface of earth at far lower temperatures than the surface of the sun almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in mid-infrared region much longer than in sunlight of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light energy regions within the infrarededit in general objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object in accordance with wien's displacement law therefore the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections commonly used sub-division schemeedit a commonly used sub-division scheme is:11  temperatures of black bodies for which spectral peaks fall at the given wavelengths according to wien's displacement law13 nir and swir is sometimes called reflected infrared whereas mwir and lwir is sometimes referred to as thermal infrared due to the nature of the blackbody radiation curves typical hot objects such as exhaust pipes often appear brighter in the mw compared to the same object viewed in the lw cie division schemeedit the international commission on illumination cie recommended the division of infrared radiation into the following three bands:14 iso 20473 schemeedit iso 20473 specifies the following scheme:15 astronomy division schemeedit astronomers typically divide the infrared spectrum as follows:16 these divisions are not precise and can vary depending on the publication the three regions are used for observation of different temperature ranges and hence different environments in space the most common photometric system used in astronomy allocates capital letters to different spectral regions according to filters used i j h and k cover the near-infrared wavelengths l m n and q refer to the mid-infrared region these letters are commonly understood in reference to atmospheric windows and appear for instance in the titles of many papers sensor response division schemeedit a third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various detectors:17 telecommunication bands in the infrarededit in optical communications the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting/absorbing materials fibers and detectors:19 the c-band is the dominant band for long-distance telecommunication networks the s and l bands are based on less well established technology and are not as widely deployed heatedit heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared extending into visible ultraviolet and even x-ray regions e.g the solar corona thus the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical comparatively low temperatures often found near the surface of planet earth the concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects this is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body to further explain two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity for example for any pre-set emissivity value objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler for that reason incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers applicationsedit night visionedit infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see.22 night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light.22 infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source.22 the use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with thermal imaging which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation heat that emanates from objects and their surrounding environment.23 thermographyedit infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects if the emissivity is known this is termed thermography or in the case of very hot objects in the nir or visible it is termed pyrometry thermography thermal imaging is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs hyperspectral imagingedit a hyperspectral image is a picture containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range at each pixel hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with nir swir mwir and lwir spectral regions typical applications include biological mineralogical defence and industrial measurements thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a thermographic camera with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full lwir spectrum consequently chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the moon such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements outdoor surveillance and uav applications.25 other imagingedit in infrared photography infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum digital cameras often use infrared blockers cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can see intense near-infrared appearing as a bright purple-white color this is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near ir-bright areas such as near a lamp where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image there is also a technique called 't-ray imaging which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques recently t-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy trackingedit infrared tracking also known as infrared homing refers to a passive missile guidance system which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as heat-seekers since infrared ir is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies many objects such as people vehicle engines and aircraft generate and retain heat and as such are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.26 heatingedit infrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source for example it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants it may also be used in other heating applications such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft de-icing.27 infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque absorbent objects rather than the air around them infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes e.g curing of coatings forming of plastics annealing plastic welding and print drying in these applications infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating efficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material coolingedit communicationsedit ir data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants these devices usually conform to standards published by irda the infrared data association remote controls and irda devices use infrared light-emitting diodes leds to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam the beam is modulated i.e switched on and off to prevent interference from other sources of infrared like sunlight or artificial lighting the receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current it responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density ir does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances infrared remote control protocols like rc-5 sirc are used to communicate with infrared free space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable except for the radiation damage since the eye cannot detect ir blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.28 ir data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the rias remote infrared audible signage project transmitting ir data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as beaming spectroscopyedit thin film metrologyedit in the semiconductor industry infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures by measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer the index of refraction n and the extinction coefficient k can be determined via the forouhi-bloomer dispersion equations the reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension depth and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures meteorologyedit climatologyedit in the field of climatology atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere these trends provide information on long-term changes in earth's climate it is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global warming together with solar radiation astronomyedit astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components including mirrors lenses and solid state digital detectors for this reason it is classified as part of optical astronomy to form an image the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources and the detectors are chilled using liquid helium the sensitivity of earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows this limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy the infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers cold dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected in the visible light spectrum the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet. infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies which are often cloaked in gas and dust distant galaxies with a high redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths so they are more readily observed in the infrared.8 infrared cleaningedit infrared cleaning is a technique used by some motion picture film scanners film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan it works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels red green and blue the infrared channel in combination with the other channels is used to detect the location of scratches and dust once located those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.29 art conservation and analysisedit among many other changes in the arnolfini portrait of 1434 left the man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye the woman's was higher and her eyes looked more to the front each of his feet was underdrawn in one position painted in another and then overpainted in a third these alterations are seen in infrared reflectograms.32 recent progress in the design of infrared sensitive cameras made it possible to discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti but entire paintings which were later overpainted by the artist.33 notable examples are picasso's woman ironing and blue room where in both cases a portrait of a man has been made visible under the painting as it is known today similar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various types of objects especially very old written documents such as the dead sea scrolls the roman works in the villa of the papyri and the silk road texts found in the dunhuang caves.34 carbon black used in ink can show up extremely well biological systemsedit the pit viper has a pair of infrared sensory pits on its head there is uncertainty regarding the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological infrared detection system.3536 other organisms that have thermoreceptive organs are pythons family pythonidae some boas family boidae the common vampire bat desmodus rotundus a variety of jewel beetles melanophila acuminata37 darkly pigmented butterflies pachliopta aristolochiae and troides rhadamantus plateni and possibly blood-sucking bugs triatoma infestans.38 photobiomodulationedit near-infrared light or photobiomodulation is used for treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral ulceration as well as wound healing there is some work relating to anti-herpes virus treatment.44 research projects include work on central nervous system healing effects via cytochrome c oxidase upregulation and other possible mechanisms.45 health hazardedit strong infrared radiation in certain industry high-heat settings may be hazardous to the eyes resulting in damage or blindness to the user since the radiation is invisible special ir-proof goggles must be worn in such places.46 history of infrared scienceedit the discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to william herschel the astronomer in the early 19th century herschel published his results in 1800 before the royal society of london herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared beyond the red part of the spectrum through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer he was surprised at the result and called them calorific rays the term 'infrared did not appear until late in the 19th century.4748

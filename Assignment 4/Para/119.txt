tropical cyclone forecasting tropical cyclone forecasting is the science of forecasting where a tropical cyclone's center and its effects are expected to be at some point in the future there are several elements to tropical cyclone forecasting track forecasting intensity forecasting rainfall forecasting storm surge tornado and seasonal forecasting while skill is increasing in regard to track forecasting intensity forecasting skill remains nearly unchanged over the past several years seasonal forecasting began in the 1980s in the atlantic basin and has spread into other basins in the years since  contents  historyedit short termedit the launch of the first weather satellite tiros-i in 1960 introduced new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present in the 1970s buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements which until that point were not available at all over sea surfaces.1 long termedit trackedit the large-scale synoptic flow determines 70 to 90 percent of a tropical cyclone's motion the deep-layer mean flow is considered to be the best tool in determining track direction and speed if storms are significantly sheared use of a lower-level wind is a better predictor knowledge of the beta effect can be used to steer a tropical cyclone since it leads to a more northwest heading for tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere it is also best to smooth out short term wobbles of the storm center in order to determine a more accurate trajectory.7 because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high and low-pressure areas and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones and a wealth of data from earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.8 an accurate track forecast is important because if the track forecast is incorrect forecasts for intensity rainfall storm surge and tornado threat will also be incorrect 1-2-3 ruleedit intensityedit forecasters say they are less skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones than cyclone track.11 they attribute the lack of improvement in intensity forecasting to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development maximum potential intensityedit dr kerry emanuel created a mathematical model around 1988 called the maximum potential intensity or mpi to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the latest global model runs maps created from this equation show values of the maximum achievable intensity due to the thermodynamics of the atmosphere at the time of the last model run either 0000 or 1200 utc however mpi does not take vertical wind shear into account.13 mpi is computed using the following formula vabectt0displaystyle v=a+bcdot e^ct-t_0 rainfalledit operational methodsedit historically tropical cyclone tracking charts were used to include the past track and prepare future forecasts at regional specialized meteorological centers and tropical cyclone warning centers the need for a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent to operational weather forecasters by the mid-1980s at that time the united states department of defense was using paper maps acetate grease pencils and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones.19 the automated tropical cyclone forecasting system atcf software was developed by the naval research laboratory for the joint typhoon warning center jtwc beginning in 198620 and used since 1988 during 1990 the system was adapted by the national hurricane center nhc for use at the nhc national centers for environmental prediction and the central pacific hurricane center.2021 this provided the nhc with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25 or 1 hour.21 atcf was originally developed for use within dos before later being adapted to unix and linux.20 storm surgeedit the main storm surge forecast model in the atlantic basin is slosh which stands for sea lake overland surge from hurricanes.22 it uses the size of a storm its intensity its forward motion and the topography of the coastal plain to estimate the depth of a storm surge at any individual grid point across the united states an accurate forecast track is required in order to produce accurate storm surge forecasts however if the landfall point is uncertain a maximum envelope of water meow map can be generated based on the direction of approach if the forecast track itself is also uncertain a maximum of maximums mom map can be generated which will show the worst possible scenario for a hurricane of a specific strength.23 tornadoedit the location of most tropical cyclone-related tornadoes is their northeast quadrant in the northern hemisphere and southeast quadrant in the southern hemisphere.24 like most of the other forecasts for tropical cyclone effects an accurate track forecast is required in order to produce an accurate tornado threat forecast seasonal forecastedit see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export

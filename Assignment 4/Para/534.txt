gwr 3031 class the dean single 3031 class or achilles class was a type of steam locomotive built by the british great western railway between 1891 and 1899 they were designed by william dean for passenger work the first 30 members of the class were built as 2-2-2s of the 3001 class in the 3001 class the steam chest was located underneath the cylinders and contained two slide valves the inverted placement of the valves allowed them to drop away from the face of the steam ports when steam was shut off thus reducing wear.4 the steam chest and valves lay above the front carrying axle and there was sufficient clearance to allow the steam chest cover to be removed over the axle for maintenance replacing the axle with a bogie of conventional design would have obstructed access to the port faces dean instead used a suspension bogie in which the weight of the locomotive was transferred upwards to the bogie by four bolts mounted on the inside frames the centre pin of the bogie rotated in a spring-centred block mounted beneath the steam chest on cross beams this setup gave sufficient clearance so that when the bolts were undone the front end of the locomotive raised and the bogie was run out from underneath the steam chest cover could be removed without hindrance.2 in 1900 george jackson churchward replaced the boiler on number 3027 worcester with a parallel standard 2 boiler twelve further engines were similarly converted in 1905 and 1906  contents  notable members of the classedit 3065 duke of connaught made a record-breaking run with the ocean mail on 9 may 1904 covering the distance from bristol pylle hill to paddington in 99 minutes 46 seconds10 as part of a run from plymouth to paddington in 227 minutes 3041 the queen originally named james mason was an example of this class allocated to royal train duties number 3046 lord of the isles has enjoyed a certain amount of celebrity having been chosen as the prototype for a tri-ang model locomotive since then the engine has also been modelled by brio and matchbox in 2006 hornby also produced a limited edition of the same model this time bearing the name lorna doone replicaedit none of the original class survive but a static replica of the queen was commissioned by tussauds for the railways and royalty exhibition at windsor and eton central railway station the replica loco was completed in december 1982 and displayed outside steamtown in january 1983 where it was constructed before being transported by road to windsor on 12 january 1983 and arriving on 14 january the main frames footplate 'boiler' smokebox cab and splashers were fabricated by babcock's of tipton the tender was modified from an lbscr c2x tender parts from a gwr tender that came from the dumbleton hall preservation society were used to provide the wheels for the front bogie and the real wheels the top halves of the driving wheels do not exist and were cast from 2 quarters being bolted together to make a half and the driving wheels also don't sit on the rail so the loco could be wheeled into position on its front bogie and rear wheels some boiler fittings were obtained from the great western society and sandblasted and the dome and safety valve bonnet were made by newcastle metal spinners tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators so steam was emitted from the cab whistles safety valves and smoke from the chimney a sound unit was also fitted.11 the engine remains there but the tender was scrapped to make more space for the shopping centre occupying that station building the bluebell railway atlantic group purchased the axleboxes springs and the complete wheel sets from the tender for use in their newbuild atlantic project numberingedit modelsedit hornby railways manufacture a model of the 3031 class in oo gauge civic heraldryedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

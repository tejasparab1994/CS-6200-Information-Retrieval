eye cyclone  contents  structureedit while normally quite symmetric eyes can be oblong and irregular especially in weakening storms a large ragged eye is a non-circular eye which appears fragmented and is an indicator of a weak or weakening tropical cyclone an open eye is an eye which can be circular but the eyewall does not completely encircle the eye also indicating a weakening moisture-deprived cyclone both of these observations are used to estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones via dvorak analysis.5 eyewalls are typically circular however distinctly polygonal shapes ranging from triangles to hexagons occasionally occur.6 while typical mature storms have eyes that are a few dozen miles across rapidly intensifying storms can develop an extremely small clear and circular eye sometimes referred to as a pinhole eye storms with pinhole eyes are prone to large fluctuations in intensity and provide difficulties and frustrations for forecasters.7 formation and detectionedit tropical cyclones typically form from large disorganized areas of disturbed weather in tropical regions as more thunderstorms form and gather the storm develops rainbands which start rotating around a common center as the storm gains strength a ring of stronger convection forms at a certain distance from the rotational center of the developing storm since stronger thunderstorms and heavier rain mark areas of stronger updrafts the barometric pressure at the surface begins to drop and air begins to build up in the upper levels of the cyclone.12 this results in the formation of an upper level anticyclone or an area of high atmospheric pressure above the central dense overcast consequently most of this built up air flows outward anticyclonically above the tropical cyclone outside the forming eye the anticyclone at the upper levels of the atmosphere enhances the flow towards the center of the cyclone pushing air towards the eyewall and causing a positive feedback loop.12 there are many aspects of this process which remain a mystery scientists do not know why a ring of convection forms around the center of circulation instead of on top of it or why the upper-level anticyclone only ejects a portion of the excess air above the storm many theories exist as to the exact process by which the eye forms all that is known for sure is that the eye is necessary for tropical cyclones to achieve high wind speeds.12 the formation of an eye is almost always an indicator of increasing tropical cyclone organisation and strength because of this forecasters watch developing storms closely for signs of eye formation for storms with a clear eye detection of the eye is as simple as looking at pictures from a weather satellite however for storms with a filled eye or an eye completely covered by the central dense overcast other detection methods must be used observations from ships and hurricane hunters can pinpoint an eye visually by looking for a drop in wind speed or lack of rainfall in the storm's center in the united states south korea and a few other countries a network of nexrad doppler weather radar stations can detect eyes near the coast weather satellites also carry equipment for measuring atmospheric water vapor and cloud temperatures which can be used to spot a forming eye in addition scientists have recently discovered that the amount of ozone in the eye is much higher than the amount in the eyewall due to air sinking from the ozone-rich stratosphere instruments sensitive to ozone perform measurements which are used to observe rising and sinking columns of air and provide indication of the formation of an eye even before satellite imagery can determine its formation.13 associated phenomenaedit eyewall replacement cyclesedit the discovery of this process was partially responsible for the end of the u.s government's hurricane modification experiment project stormfury this project set out to seed clouds outside the eyewall causing a new eyewall to form and weakening the storm when it was discovered that this was a natural process due to hurricane dynamics the project was quickly abandoned.8 moatsedit eyewall mesovorticesedit eyewall mesovortices are small scale rotational features found in the eyewalls of intense tropical cyclones they are similar in principle to small suction vortices often observed in multiple-vortex tornadoes.16 in these vortices wind speeds may be greater than anywhere else in the eyewall.17 eyewall mesovortices are most common during periods of intensification in tropical cyclones.16 eyewall mesovortices often exhibit unusual behavior in tropical cyclones they usually rotate around the low pressure center but sometimes they remain stationary eyewall mesovortices have even been documented to cross the eye of a storm these phenomena have been documented observationally18 experimentally16 and theoretically.19 eyewall mesovortices are a significant factor in the formation of tornadoes after tropical cyclone landfall mesovortices can spawn rotation in individual thunderstorms a mesocyclone which leads to tornadic activity at landfall friction is generated between the circulation of the tropical cyclone and land this can allow the mesovortices to descend to the surface causing tornadoes.20 stadium effectedit the stadium effect is a phenomenon observed in strong tropical cyclones it is a fairly common event where the clouds of the eyewall curve outward from the surface with height this gives the eye an appearance resembling an open dome from the air akin to a sports stadium an eye is always larger at the top of the storm and smallest at the bottom of the storm because the rising air in the eyewall follows isolines of equal angular momentum which also slope outward with height.212223 in tropical cyclones with very small eyes the sloping phenomenon is much more pronounced eye-like featuresedit hazardsedit a common mistake especially in areas where hurricanes are uncommon is for residents to exit their homes to inspect the damage while the calm eye passes over only to be caught off guard by the violent winds in the opposite eyewall.29 other cyclonesedit though only tropical cyclones have structures officially termed eyes there are other weather systems that can exhibit eye-like features.130 polar lowsedit extratropical cyclonesedit extratropical cyclones are areas of low pressure which exist at the boundary of different air masses almost all storms found at mid-latitudes are extratropical in nature including classic north american nor'easters and european windstorms the most severe of these can have a clear eye at the site of lowest barometric pressure though it is usually surrounded by lower non-convective clouds and is found near the back end of the storm.32 subtropical cyclonesedit subtropical cyclones are low-pressure systems with some extratropical characteristics and some tropical characteristics as such they may have an eye while not being truly tropical in nature subtropical cyclones can be very hazardous generating high winds and seas and often evolve into fully tropical cyclones for this reason the national hurricane center began including subtropical storms in its naming scheme in 2002.33 tornadoesedit extraterrestrial vorticesedit nasa reported in november 2006 that the cassini spacecraft observed a hurricane-like storm locked to the south pole of saturn with a clearly defined eyewall the observation was particularly notable as eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than earth including a failure to observe an eyewall in the great red spot of jupiter by the galileo spacecraft.36 in 2007 very large vortices on both poles of venus were observed by the venus express mission of the european space agency to have a dipole eye structure.37 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

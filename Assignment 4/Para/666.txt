historyedit colonial eraedit after the first permanent english-speaking settlement was established in april 1607 at jamestown virginia captain christopher newport led explorers northwest up the james river to an area that was inhabited by powhatan native americans.7 in 1737 planter william byrd ii commissioned major william mayo to lay out the original town grid byrd named the city richmond after the english town of richmond near and now part of london because the view of the james river was strikingly similar to the view of the river thames from richmond hill in england where he had spent time during his youth the settlement was laid out in april 1737 and was incorporated as a town in 1742.8 revolutionedit in 1775 patrick henry delivered his famous give me liberty or give me death speech in st john's church in richmond crucial for deciding virginia's participation in the first continental congress and setting the course for revolution and independence.9 on april 18 1780 the state capital was moved from the colonial capital of williamsburg to richmond to provide a more centralized location for virginia's increasing westerly population as well as to isolate the capital from british attack.10 the latter motive proved to be in vain and in 1781 under the command of benedict arnold richmond was burned by british troops causing governor thomas jefferson to flee as the virginia militia led by sampson mathews defended the city.11 early united statesedit after the american revolutionary war 1775-1783 richmond emerged as an important industrial center to facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed james river bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below an enterprising george washington helped design the james river and kanawha canal from westham east to richmond in the 18th century to bypass richmond's rapids on the upper james river with the intent of providing a water route across the appalachian mountains to the kanawha river flowing westward into the ohio then eventually to the mississippi river the legacy of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag as a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the falls richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities in the country including iron works and flour mills the largest facilities of their kind in the south the resistance to the slave trade was growing by the mid-nineteenth century in one famous case in 1848 henry box brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from richmond through baltimore's president street station northward on the philadelphia wilmington and baltimore railroad a well-used underground railroad route for escaping disguised slaves to abolitionists in philadelphia in the free state of pennsylvania escaping slavery.14 by 1850 richmond was connected by the richmond and petersburg railroad to port walthall where ships carrying over 200 tonnes of cargo could connect to baltimore or philadelphia or passenger liners could reach norfolk virginia through the hampton roads harbor.15 civil waredit in addition to virginia and confederate government offices and hospitals a railroad hub and one of the largest slave markets richmond had the largest iron foundry and arms factory during the war the tredegar iron works which turned out artillery and other munitions including the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the css virginia former raised uss merrimac steam frigate the world's first ironclad warship used in war as well as much of the confederates heavy ordnance machinery.17 the confederate states congress shared quarters with the virginia general assembly in jefferson's designed virginia state capitol with the confederacy's executive mansion known as the white house of the confederacy located two blocks away on clay street the seven days battles followed in late june and early july 1862 during which commanding union general-in-chief george b mcclellan threatened to take richmond in the peninsula campaign but ultimately failed three years later as march 1865 ended richmond became indefensible after nearby petersburg and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken on march 25 confederate general john b gordon's desperate attack on fort stedman east of petersburg failed on april 1 federal cavalry general philip sheridan assigned to interdict the southside railroad met brigades commanded by southern gen george pickett at the five forks junction smashing them taking thousands of prisoners and encouraging union general-in-chief ulysses s grant to order a general advance when the union sixth corps broke through confederate lines on the boydton plank road south of petersburg confederate casualties exceeded 5000 or about a tenth of general lee's defending army lee then informed president jefferson davis that he was about to evacuate richmond.18 davis and his cabinet along with the government archives and treasury gold left the city by train that night as government officials burned documents and departing confederate troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny their contents to the victors on april 2 1865 general godfrey weitzel commander of the 25th corps of the united states colored troops accepted the city's surrender from the mayor and a group of leading citizens who remained.19 the union troops eventually managed to stop the raging fires but about 25 of the city's buildings were destroyed.20 president abraham lincoln visited general grant at petersburg on april 3 and took a launch to richmond up the james river the next day while jefferson davis attempted to organize his remaining confederate government further southwest at danville lincoln met confederate assistant secretary of war john a campbell and handed him a note inviting virginia's state legislature to end their rebellion after campbell spun the note to confederate legislators as a possible end to the emancipation proclamation lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered general weitzel to prevent the former confederate state legislature from meeting union forces killed wounded or captured 8000 confederate troops at sayler's creek southwest of petersburg on april 6 as the southerners continued a general retreat southwestward general lee continued to reject general grant's surrender suggestions until sheridan's infantry and cavalry moved around the shrinking army of northern virginia and appeared in front of his withdrawing forces on april 8 cutting off the line of further retreat southwest he surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops at appomattox court house meeting general grant the following morning at the mclean home.21 davis was captured on may 10th near irwinville georgia and taken back to virginia where he was imprisoned for two years at fort monroe until freed on bail.22 postbellumedit richmond emerged a decade after the smoldering rubble of the civil war to resume its position as an economic powerhouse with iron front buildings and massive brick factories canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads allowing richmond to become a major railroad crossroads eventually including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing.23 tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine invented by james albert bonsack of roanoke in 1880/81 contributing to richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the united states the richmond union passenger railway designed by electric power pioneer frank j sprague the trolley system opened its first line in 1888 and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country.24 sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current with electric motors on the car's trucks.25 in richmond the transition from streetcars to buses began in may 1947 and was completed on november 25 1949.26 20th centuryedit several major performing arts venues were

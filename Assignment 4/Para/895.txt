european space agency esa's space flight programme includes human spaceflight mainly through participation in the international space station programme the launch and operation of unmanned exploration missions to other planets and the moon earth observation science and telecommunication designing launch vehicles and maintaining a major spaceport the guiana space centre at kourou french guiana the main european launch vehicle ariane 5 is operated through arianespace with esa sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle the agency's facilities are distributed among the following centres  contents  historyedit foundationedit after world war ii many european scientists left western europe in order to work with the united states although the 1950s boom made it possible for western european countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities western european scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers in 1958 only months after the sputnik shock edoardo amaldi italy and pierre auger france two prominent members of the western european scientific community met to discuss the foundation of a common western european space agency the meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries including harrie massey united kingdom the western european nations decided to have two agencies one concerned with developing a launch system eldo european launch development organization and the other the precursor of the european space agency esro european space research organisation the latter was established on 20 march 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 june 1962 from 1968 to 1972 esro launched seven research satellites esa in its current form was founded with the esa convention in 1975 when esro was merged with eldo esa had ten founding member states belgium denmark france germany italy the netherlands spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom.9 these signed the esa convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980 when the convention came into force during this interval the agency functioned in a de facto fashion esa launched its first major scientific mission in 1975 cos-b a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe which was first worked on by esro later activitiesedit as the successor of eldo esa has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads ariane 1 launched in 1979 carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward the next two versions of the ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system the ariane 4 which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established esa as the world leadercitation needed in commercial space launches in the 1990s although the succeeding ariane 5 experienced a failure on its first flight it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 56 successful launches as of september 2011 the successor launch vehicle of ariane 5 the ariane 6 is under development and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s the beginning of the new millennium saw esa become along with agencies like nasa jaxa isro csa and roscosmos one of the major participants in scientific space research although esa had relied on co-operation with nasa in previous decades especially the 1990s changed circumstances such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the united states military led to decisions to rely more on itself and on co-operation with russia a 2011 press issue thus stated:10 russia is esa's first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space there is a framework agreement between esa and the government of the russian federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and cooperation is already under way in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners notable outcomes are esa's include smart-1 a probe testing cutting-edge new space propulsion technology the mars express and venus express missions as well as the development of the ariane 5 rocket and its role in the iss partnership esa maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for astronomy-space missions such as corot launched on 27 december 2006 a milestone in the search for extra-solar planets missionedit the treaty establishing the european space agency reads:11 esa's purpose shall be to provide for and to promote for exclusively peaceful purposes cooperation among european states in space research and technology and their space applications with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems esa is responsible for setting a unified space and related industrial policy recommending space objectives to the member states and integrating national programs like satellite development into the european program as much as possible.11 jean-jacques dordain  esa's director general 2003-2015  outlined the european space agency's mission in a 2003 interview:12 today space activities are pursued for the benefit of citizens and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on earth they want greater security and economic wealth but they also want to pursue their dreams to increase their knowledge and they want younger people to be attracted to the pursuit of science and technology i think that space can do all of this it can produce a higher quality of life better security more economic wealth and also fulfill our citizens dreams and thirst for knowledge and attract the young generation this is the reason space exploration is an integral part of overall space activities it has always been so and it will be even more important in the future activities and programmesedit esa describes its work in two overlapping ways activitiesedit according to the esa website the activities are programmesedit mandatoryedit every member country must contribute to these programmes listed according to:13 optionaledit depending on their individual choices the countries can contribute to the following programmes listed according to:14 member states funding and budgetedit membership and contribution to esaedit the following table lists all the member states and adjunct members their esa convention ratification dates and their contributions in 2016:22 associate membersedit currently the only associated member of esa is canada.32 previously associated members were austria norway and finland all of which later joined esa as full members canadaedit budget appropriation and allocationedit esa is funded from annual contributions by national governments as well as from an annual contribution by the european union eu.40 enlargementedit after the decision of the esa council of 21/22 march 2001 the procedure for accession of the european states was detailed as described the document titled the plan for european co-operating states pecs.42 nations that want to become a full member of esa do so in 3 stages first a cooperation agreement is signed between the country and esa in this stage the country has very limited financial responsibilities if a country wants to co-operate more fully with esa it signs a european cooperating state ecs agreement the ecs agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in esa procurements the country can also participate in all esa programmes except for the basic technology research programme while the financial contribution of the country concerned increases it is still much lower than that of a full member state the agreement is normally followed by a plan for european cooperating state or pecs charter this is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation's space industry capacity at the end of the 5-year period the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new pecs charter.43 many countries most of which joined the eu in both 2004 and 2007 have started to co-operate with esa on various levels during the ministerial meeting in december 2014 esa ministers approved a resolution calling for discussions to begin with israel australia and south africa on future association agreements the ministers noted that concrete cooperation is at an advanced stage with these nations and that prospects for mutual benefits are existing.64 a separate space exploration strategy resolution calls for further co-operation with the united states russia and china on leo exploration including a continuation of iss cooperation and the development of a robust plan for the coordinated use of space transportation vehicles and systems for exploration purposes participation in robotic missions for the exploration of the moon the robotic exploration of mars leading to a broad mars sample return mission in which europe should be involved as a full partner and human missions beyond leo in the longer term.64 eu and the european space agencyedit the political perspective of the european union eu was to make esa an agency of the eu by 201465 although this date was not met the eu is already the largest single donor to esa's budget and non-esa eu states are observers at esa the only current eu member state that has not signed an esa cooperation agreement is croatia in december 2014 the esa ministerial council authorised officials to begin discussions to establish formal co-operation with croatia.66 launch vehicle fleetedit ariane 5edit the ariane 5 rocket is esa's primary launcher it has been in service since 1997 and replaced ariane 4 two different variants are currently in use the heaviest and most used version the ariane 5 eca delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into gto it failed during its first test flight in 2002 but has since made 71 consecutive successful flights as of march 2016 the other version ariane 5 es was used to launch the automated transfer vehicle atv to the international space station iss and will be used to launch four galileo navigational satellites at a time.6768 in november 2012 esa agreed to build an upgraded variant called ariane 5 me mid-life evolution which will increase payload capacity to 11.5 tonnes to gto and feature a restartable second stage to allow more complex missions ariane 5 me is scheduled to fly in 2018.69 some of its new features will also be adopted by the next-generation launcher ariane 6 planned to replace ariane 5 in the 2020s esa's ariane 1 2 3 and 4 launchers the last of which was esa's long-time workhorse have been retired soyuzedit soyuz first launched from kourou on 21 october 2011 and successfully placed two galileo satellites into orbit 23222 kilometres above earth.70 vegaedit the rocket has three solid propulsion stages and a liquid propulsion upper stage the avum for accurate orbital insertion and the ability to place multiple payloads into different orbits.7374 ariane launch vehicle development fundingedit historically the ariane family rockets have been funded primarily with money contributed by esa governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids this has meant that governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90 return on investment in the form of industrial workshare. esa is proposing changes to this scheme by moving to competitive bids for the development of the ariane 6.75 human space flightedit historyedit during the latter half of the 1980s european human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore in 1990 the european astronaut centre in cologne germany was established it selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners especially with regard to the international space station as of 2006 the esa astronaut corps officially included twelve members including nationals from most large european countries except the united kingdom in the summer of 2008 esa started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009 almost 10000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in june 2008 8413 fulfilled the initial application criteria of the applicants 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing which narrowed down the field to 192 after two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009 as well as formal interviews six new members of the european astronaut corps were selected  five men and one woman.76 astronaut namesedit the astronauts of the european space agency are crew vehiclesedit in the 1980s france pressed for an independent european crew launch vehicle around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in november 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of hermes was introduced the craft was comparable to early proposals for the space shuttle and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments with a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the ariane 5 rocket which was being developed at that time it was planned solely for use in low-earth orbit space flights the planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991 the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly with the fall of the soviet union esa looked forward to co-operation with russia to build a next-generation space vehicle thus the hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent the columbus space station programme had a similar fate in november 2012 esa decided to join nasa's orion programme the atv would form the basis of a propulsion unit for nasa's new manned spacecraft esa may also seek to work with nasa on orion's launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.83 in september 2014 esa signed an agreement with sierra nevada corporation for co-operation in dream chaser project further studies on the dream chaser for european utilization or dc4eu project were funded including the feasibility of launching a europeanized dream chaser onboard ariane 5.8485 cooperation with other countries and organisationsedit esa has signed co-operation agreements with the following states that currently neither plan to integrate as tightly with esa institutions as canada nor envision future membership of esa argentina86 brazil87 china88 india89 for the chandrayan mission russia90 and turkey.91 additionally esa has joint projects with the european union nasa of the united states and is participating in the international space station together with the united states nasa russia and japan jaxa european unionedit esa is not an agency or body of the european union eu and has non-eu countries norway and switzerland as members there are however ties between the two with various agreements in place and being worked on to define the legal status of esa with regard to the eu.92 there are common goals between esa and the eu esa has an eu liaison office in brussels on certain projects the eu and esa co-operate such as the upcoming galileo satellite navigation system space policy has since december 2009 been an area for voting in the european council under the european space policy of 2007 the eu esa and its member states committed themselves to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and to organising their respective roles relating to space.93 the lisbon treaty of 2009 reinforces the case for space in europe and strengthens the role of esa as an r&d space agency article 189 of the treaty gives the eu a mandate to elaborate a european space policy and take related measures and provides that the eu should establish appropriate relations with esa former italian astronaut umberto guidoni during his tenure as a member of the european parliament from 2004 to 2009 stressed the importance of the european union as a driving force for space exploration since other players are coming up such as india and china it is becoming ever more important that europeans can have an independent access to space we have to invest more into space research and technology in order to have an industry capable of competing with other international players.94 the first eu-esa international conference on human space exploration took place in prague on 22 and 23 october 2009.95 a road map which would lead to a common vision and strategic planning in the area of space exploration was discussed ministers from all 29 eu and esa members as well as members of parliament were in attendance.96 national space organisations of member statesedit nasaedit esa has a long history of collaboration with nasa since esa's astronaut corps was formed the space shuttle has been the primary launch vehicle used by esa's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with nasa in the 1980s and 1990s the spacelab programme was an esa-nasa joint research programme that had esa develop and manufacture orbital labs for the space shuttle for several flights on which esa participate with astronauts in experiments cooperation with other space agenciesedit since china has started to invest more money into space activities the chinese space agency has sought international partnerships esa is beside the russian space agency one of its most important partners recently the two space agencies cooperated in the development of the double star mission.97 esa entered into a major joint venture with russia in the form of the csts the preparation of french guiana spaceport for launches of soyuz-2 rockets and other projects with india esa agreed to send instruments into space aboard the isro's chandrayaan-1 in 2008.98 esa is also co-operating with japan the most notable current project in collaboration with jaxa is the bepicolombo mission to mercury speaking to reporters at an air show near moscow in august 2011 esa head jean-jacques dordain said esa and russia's roskosmos space agency would carry out the first flight to mars together.99 international space stationedit as of 2013 the spacecraft establishing supply links to the iss are the russian progress and soyuz european atv japanese kounotori htv and the usa cots program vehicles dragon and cygnus european life and physical sciences research on board the international space station iss is mainly based on the european programme for life and physical sciences in space programme that was initiated in 2001 languagesedit according to annex 1 resolution no 8 of the esa convention and council rules of procedure4 english french and german may be used in all meetings of the agency with interpretation provided into these three languages all official documents are available in english and french with all documents concerning the esa council being available in german as well facilitiesedit esa and the eu institutionsedit the eu flag is the one to be flown in space during missions for example it was flown by esa's andre kuipers during delta mission the commission is increasingly working together towards common objectives some 20 per cent of the funds managed by esa now originate from the supranational budget of the european union esa maintains a liaison office in brussels to facilitate relations with the european institutions guaranteeing european access to spaceedit in may 2007 the 29 european countries expressed their support for the european space policy in a resolution of the space council unifying the approach of esa with those of the european union and their member states through this resolution the eu esa and their member states all commit to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and their respective roles relating to space.105 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more

subtropical ridge  contents  formationedit heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of convection along the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone this air mass rises to the lower stratosphere where it diverges moving away from the equator in the upper troposphere in both northerly and southerly directions as it moves towards the mid-latitudes on both sides of the equator the air cools and sinks the resulting air mass subsidence creates a subtropical ridge of high pressure near the 30th parallel in both hemispheres at the surface level the sinking air diverges again with some returning to the equator completing the hadley circulation this circulation on each side of the equator is known as the hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.1 many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure areas migrationedit the subtropical ridge starts migrating poleward in late spring reaching its zenith in early autumn before retreating equatorward during the late fall winter and early spring the equatorward migration of the subtropical ridge during the cold season is due to increasing north-south temperature differences between the poles and tropics.2 the latitudinal movement of the subtropical ridge is strongly correlated with the progression of the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone role in weather formation and air qualityedit when the subtropical ridge in the northwest pacific is stronger than normal it leads to a wet monsoon season for asia.6 the subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the united states the subtropical ridge across north america typically migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the desert southwest from july to september.7 when the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the four corners monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into arizona when the high pressure moves south its circulation cuts off the moisture and the atmosphere dries out across the desert southwest causing a break in the monsoon regime.8 on the subtropical ridges western edge eastern coast of continents the high pressure cell creates a southerly flow of tropical air toward the lower east sides of continents in the summer months in the united states the subtropical ridge bermuda high helps create the hot sultry summers with daily thunderstorms typical of the gulf and atlantic states this flow pattern also occurs on the eastern coasts of continents in other subtropical climates such as south china southern japan central-eastern south america southern queensland and kwazulu natal province in south africa.9 when surface winds become light the subsidence produced directly under the subtropical ridge can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge leading to widespread haze.10 if the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight fog can form.11 referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

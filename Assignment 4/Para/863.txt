1935 labor day hurricane on long key it struck about midway through the calm the waters quickly receded after carving new channels connecting the bay with the ocean however gale force winds and high seas persisted into tuesday preventing rescue efforts the storm continued northwest along the florida west coast weakening before its second landfall near cedar key florida on september 4  contents  meteorological historyedit the storm continued into the north atlantic ocean where off southern greenland it was lost on september 10 by merging with a cyclone of extratropical origin.2 recordsedit records of the lowest pressure were secured from three aneroid barometers the values ranging from 26.75 to 26.98 inches however none of these barometers had previously been compared to standard one of the barometers owned by ivar olson was shipped to the weather bureau in washington where it was tested in the instrument division careful laboratory tests showed it to be an exceptionally responsive and reliable instrument and that the correct reading at the position of the needle indicated by mr olson at the center of the storm was 26.35 inches this is the world's lowest record of pressure at a land station.12 preparationsedit northeast storm warnings15 were ordered displayed from fort pierce to fort myers in the september 1 9:30 am weather bureau advisory.16 upon receipt of this advisory the u.s coast guard station miami fl sent a plane along the coast to advise boaters and campers of the impending danger by dropping message blocks a second flight was made sunday afternoon all planes were placed in the hangar and its door closed at 10:00 am monday morning.1718 the 3:30 am advisory september 2 labor day predicted the disturbance will probably pass through the florida straits monday and cautioned against high tides and gales florida keys and ships in path.19 the 1:30 pm advisory ordered hurricane warnings15 for the key west district16 which extended north to key largo.20 at around 2:00 pm fred ghent assistant administrator florida emergency relief administration requested a special train to evacuate the veterans work camps located in the upper keys.21 it departed miami at 4:25 pm delayed by a draw bridge opening obstructions across the track poor visibility and the necessity to back the locomotive below homestead so it could head out on the return trip22 the train finally arrived at the islamorada station on upper matecumbe key at about 8:20 pm this coincided with an abrupt wind shift from northeast florida bay to southeast atlantic ocean and the arrival on the coast of the storm surge.2 impactedit on upper matecumbe key near islamorada an eleven-car evacuation train encountered a powerful storm surge topped by cresting waves eleven cars25 were swept from the tracks leaving only the locomotive and tender upright and still on the rails remarkably everyone on the train survived.26 the locomotive and tender were both barged back to miami several months later the united states coast guard and other federal and state agencies organized evacuation and relief efforts boats and airplanes carried injured survivors to miami the railroad was never rebuilt but temporary bridges and ferry landings were under construction as soon as materials arrived on march 29 1938 the last gap in the overseas highway linking key west to the mainland was completed the new highway incorporated the roadbed and surviving bridges of the railway aftermathedit responseedit veterans work campsedit three veterans work camps existed in the florida keys before the hurricane #1 on windley key #3 and #5 on lower matecumbe key.29 the camp payrolls for august 30 listed 695 veterans.30 they were employed in a project to complete the overseas highway connecting the mainland with key west the camps including 7 in florida and 4 in south carolina were established by harry l hopkins director of the federal emergency relief administration fera in the autumn of 1934 the problem of transient veterans in washington dc threatened  to become acute and did become acute in january.31 facilities in the capital were inadequate to handle the large numbers of veterans seeking jobs.3233 president franklin d roosevelt met with mr hopkins and robert fechner director of the civilian conservation corps ccc to discuss solutions he suggested the southern camp plan and approved the program worked out by mr hopkins for their establishment and maintenance.34 the va identified eligible veterans.35 fera offered grants to the states for their construction projects if they would accept the veterans as laborers the state emergency relief administrations were responsible for the daily management of the camps.36 in practice the state eras were very much the creatures of fera to the extent of handpicking the administrators.3738 that only two states participated was perhaps attributable to the then popular impression that the transient veterans were diseased bums and hoboes.39 it was a characterization enthusiastically fed by the media in august 1935 both time magazine40 and the new york times published sensational articles.4142 on aug 15 1935 hopkins announced the termination of the veterans work program and closure of all the camps.43 on august 26 and 27 1935 one of the veterans albert c keith wrote letters to both the president and eleanor roosevelt urging that the camps not be closed keith was editor of the weekly camp paper the key veteran news he was emphatic that the veterans were being defamed and that their work program was actually a success story rehabilitating many veterans for return to civilian life the news published occasional reports from camp #2 mullet key st petersburg florida at the entrance to tampa bay this was the colored veterans camp the keys camps were white only in early august the colored veterans were transferred to the new camp #8 in gainesville florida.44 rescueedit improved weather conditions on wednesday september 4 permitted the evacuation of survivors to begin participating in the rescue were recoveryedit the second and third orders however were almost immediately compromised at a news conference on september 5 hopkins asserted that there was no negligence traceable to fera in the failed evacuation of the camps as the weather bureau advisories had given insufficient warning he also dispatched his assistant aubrey willis williams to florida to coordinate fera efforts and to investigate the deaths.52 williams and hines assistant colonel george e ijams both arrived in miami on september 6 ijams concentrated on the dead their collection identification and proper disposition.53 this was to prove exceptionally difficult bodies were scattered throughout the keys and their rapid decomposition created ghastly conditions state and local health officials demanded a ban on all movement of bodies and their immediate burial or cremation in place the next day governor sholtz so ordered.54 this was reluctantly agreed to by hines with the understanding that those buried would be later disinterred and shipped home or to arlington when permitted by the state health authorities.55 the cremations began on saturday september 7 38 bodies were burned together at the collection point beside snake creek over the next week 136 bodies were cremated on upper matecumbe key at 12 different locations on lower matecumbe key 82 were burned at 20 sites on numerous small keys in florida bay bodies were either burned or buried where found this effort continued into november 123 bodies had been transported to miami before the embargo these were processed at a temporary morgue staffed by fingerprint experts and 8 volunteer undertakers under tents at woodlawn park cemetery 3260 sw 8th st miami the intention was to identify the remains and prepare them for burial or further shipment with the embargo in force immediate burial of all the bodies at woodlawn was mandatory fera purchased a plot in section 2a the va coordinated the ceremony with full military honors on september 8.56 109 bodies were buried in the fera plot 81 veterans 9 civilians and 19 unidentified bodies.57some records claim 259 veterans were victims of the hurricane total 108 civilians and 162 veterans crematedof the rest total 55 civilians and 97 veterans buried total 163 civilians and 259 veterans =42258 although the congressional record 59 gives a report of 485 victims of the hurricane 257 veterans and 259 civilians60 the record also breaks down 694 world war i veterans by name and their status assurvived died the florida emergency relief administration reported that as of november 19 1935 the total of dead stood at 423 259 veterans and 164 civilians these numbers are reflected on the veterans storm relief map which see by march 1 1936 62 additional bodies had been recovered bringing the total to 485 257 veterans and 228 civilians.62 the discrepancy in veterans deaths resulted from the difficulty in identifying bodies particularly those found months after the hurricane and a question of definition whether to count just those on the camp payrolls or to include others not enrolled who happened to be veteransthe veterans affairs administration va compiled its own list of veterans deaths121 dead-positive identification90 missing and 45 dead-identification tentative totaling 256five others are named in a footnote one proved to be a misidentification of a previously listed veteran two were state employees working at the camps and two were unaffiliated veterans caught in the storm this gives a total for all veterans of 260.63 adding this to the florida emergency relief administration number for civilians gives a total of 488 for all deaths 12 of the dead were listed as colored.64 ernest hemingway visited the veteran's camp by boat after weathering the hurricane at his home in key west he wrote about the devastation in a critical article titled who killed the vets? for the new masses magazine.65 hemingway implied that the fera workers and families who were unfamiliar with the risks of florida hurricane season were unwitting victims of a system that appeared to lack concern for their welfare from ernest hemingway's statement on the tragedy:66 ...wealthy people yachtsmen fishermen such as president hoover and president roosevelt do not come to the florida keys in hurricane months... there is a known danger to property but veterans especially the bonus-marching variety of veterans are not property they are only human beings unsuccessful human beings and all they have to lose is their lives they are doing coolie labor for a top wage of $45 a month and they have been put down on the florida keys where they can't make trouble it is hurricane months sure but if anything comes up you can always evacuate them can't you?...it is not necessary to go into the deaths of the civilians and their families since they were on the keys of their own free will they made their living there had property and knew the hazards involved but the veterans had been sent there they had no opportunity to leave nor any protection against hurricanes and they never had a chance for their lives who sent nearly a thousand war veterans many of them husky hard-working and simply out of luck but many of them close to the border of pathological cases to live in frame shacks on the florida keys in hurricane months investigationedit williams meanwhile rushed to complete the investigation he finished on sunday september 8 the day an elaborate memorial service and mass burial of hurricane victims both coordinated by ijams were held in miami.69 ijams who had been too busy to participate in the investigation and had not questioned any of the 12 witnesses interrogated by williams nonetheless signed the 15 page report to the president.70 that night williams released it to the miami press in a radio broadcast immediately following the memorial ceremony ijams considered the timing unfortunate after receiving several critical telephone messages.71 the report exonerated everyone involved and concluded to our mind the catastrophe must be characterized as an act of god and was by its very nature beyond the power of man or instruments at his disposal to foresee sufficiently far enough in advance to permit the taking of adequate precautions capable of preventing the death and desolation which occurred.72 early also found the publicity around the report unfortunate in a telegram to his colleague assistant presidential secretary marvin h mcintyre early wrote that he had authorized hines to proceed with a complete and exhaustive joint investigation with hopkins significantly hines was to instruct his investigator that under no circumstances will any statement be made to the press until final report has been submitted to the president.73 hopkins gave similar instructions to his investigator mcintyre also was involved in damage control on sept 10 1935 the greater miami ministerial association wrote the president an angry letter labeling the report a whitewash mcintyre forwarded it to fera for a response williams returned a draft for the president's signature on sept 25th insisting the report was only preliminary and that the final and detailed report .. will be both thorough and searching.74 on november 1 1935 the american legion completed its own report on the hurricane the legion's national commander ray murphy mailed a copy to president roosevelt it concluded that ...the blame for the loss of life can be placed on inefficiency indifference and ignorance. inefficiency in the setup of the camps indifference of someone in charge as to the safety of the men ignorance of the real danger from a tropical hurricane and these i's can be added together and they spell murder at matacombe sic the committee early in its investigation noticed a tendency on the part of some to reflect on the character of the men who were veterans in the camps several parties referred to them as bums drunkards crazy men riff-raff and the like they seem to think that they got what was coming to them. how anyone could arrive at such a conclusion is impossible for us to determine if these men were bums drunkards crazy men etc then it was all the more necessary that every precaution be taken to protect them if they fell into this category they were subnormal men and should have been treated as such if they were incapable of caring for themselves then the government should have placed them in hospitals and not have sent them to a wilderness in the high-seas on a so called rehabilitation program. williams prepared a response for the president stating a final report based upon the facts obtained in this investigation by the va and fera will be submitted to me shortly at that time i shall transmit a copy of the report to you for your information and consideration.85 memorialsedit islamoradaedit although this is a grave site not a single name appears anywhere on the monument this is not a requirement for the estimated 228 civilian dead 55 of whom were buried where found or in various cemeteries.90 a memorial with identifying information is a statutory entitlement for the veterans.91 170 were cremated or never identified the va has chosen not to memorialize them despite current federal law and president roosevelt's order that hines provide a burial with full military honors for every veteran not claimed by his family the memorial was added to the u.s national register of historic places on march 16 1995.96 a heritage monument trail plaque mounted on a coral boulder before the memorial reads the florida keys memorial known locally as the hurricane monument was built to honor hundreds of american veterans and local citizens who perished in the great hurricane on labor day september 2 1935 islamorada sustained winds of 200 miles per hour and a barometer reading of 26.35 inches for many hours on that fateful holiday most local buildings and the florida east coast railway were destroyed by what remains the most savage hurricane on record hundreds of world war i veterans who had been camped in the matecumbe area while working on the construction of u.s highway one for the works progress administration wpa were killed in 1937 the cremated remains of approximately 300 people were placed within the tiled crypt in front of the monument the monument is composed of native keystone and its striking frieze depicts coconut palm trees bending before the force of hurricane winds while the waters from an angry sea lap at the bottom of their trunks monument construction was funded by the wpa and regional veterans associations over the years the hurricane monument has been cared for by local veterans hurricane survivors and descendants of the victims.97 local residents hold ceremonies at the monument every year on labor day on the monday holiday and on memorial day to honor the veterans and the civilians who died in the hurricane.98 woodlawn park cemeteryedit on january 31 1936 harvey w seeds post no 29 american legion miami florida petitioned fera for the deed to the woodlawn plot.99 the legion would use the empty grave sites for the burial of indigent veterans and accept responsibility for care of the plot after some initial confusion as to the actual owner100 the state of florida approved the title transfer a monument was placed on the plot inscribed erected by harvey w seeds post no 29 the american legion in memory of our comrades who lost their lives on the florida keys during the 1935 hurricane lest we forget.101 one other veteran killed in the storm rests at arlington daniel c main.105 his was a special case the only veteran who died in the camps who was neither cremated in the keys nor buried at woodlawn main was the camp medical director and was killed in the collapse of the small hospital at camp #1 his body was quickly recovered by survivors and shipped to his family before the embargo.106107 veterans keyedit on february 27 2006 the u.s board on geographic names approved a proposal by jerry wilkinson president historical preservation society of the upper keys to name a small island off the southern tip of lower matecumbe key for the veterans who died in the hurricane it is near where camp #3 was located veterans key108 and several concrete

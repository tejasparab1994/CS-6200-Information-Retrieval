snow snow refers to forms of ice crystals that precipitate from the atmosphere usually from clouds and undergo changes on the earth's surface.2 it pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle starting when under suitable conditions the ice crystals form in the atmosphere increase to millimeter size precipitate and accumulate on surfaces then metamorphose in place and ultimately melt slide or sublimate away snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals snowflakes take on a variety of shapes basic among these are platelets needles columns and rime as snow accumulates into a snowpack it may blow into drifts over time accumulated snow metamorphoses by sintering sublimation and freeze-thaw where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation a glacier may form otherwise snow typically melts seasonally causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater major snow-prone areas include the polar regions the upper half of the northern hemisphere and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures in the southern hemisphere snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas apart from antarctica.3 snow affects such human activities as transportation creating the need for keeping roadways wings and windows clear agriculture providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock such sports as skiing snowboarding snowmachine travel and warfare impairing target acquisition degrading the performance of combatants and materiel and impeding mobility snow affects ecosystems as well by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.1  contents  precipitation snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather system the physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures the resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations thereof occasionally some plate-like dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.4 cloud formation snow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems the most important of which is the low pressure area which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation two additional and locally productive sources of snow are lake-effect also sea-effect storms and elevation effects especially in mountains low pressure areas mid-latitude cyclones are low pressure areas which are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild snow storms to heavy blizzards.5 during a hemisphere's fall winter and spring the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall in the northern hemisphere the northern side of the low pressure area produces the most snow.6 for the southern mid-latitudes the side of a cyclone that produces the most snow is the southern side fronts a warm front can produce snow for a period as warm moist air overrides below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary often snow transitions to rain in the warm sector behind the front.7 lake and ocean effects lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake rises up through the colder air above freezes and is deposited on the leeward downwind shores.89 the same effect also occurs over bodies of salt water when it is termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow the effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores this uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.10 the areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts these include areas east of the great lakes the west coasts of northern japan the kamchatka peninsula in russia and areas near the great salt lake black sea caspian sea baltic sea and parts of the northern atlantic ocean.11 mountain effects orographic or relief snowfall is caused when masses of air pushed by wind are forced up the side of elevated land formations such as large mountains the lifting of air up the side of a mountain or range results in adiabatic cooling and ultimately condensation and precipitation moisture is removed by orographic lift leaving drier warmer air on the descending leeward side.12 the resulting enhanced productivity of snow fall13 and the decrease in temperature with elevation14 means that snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack increases with elevation in snow-prone areas.115 cloud physics a snowflake consists of roughly 1019 water molecules which are added to its core at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground as a result snowflakes vary among themselves while following similar patterns.161718 classification of snowflakes micrography of thousands of snowflakes from 1885 onward starting with wilson alwyn bentley revealed the wide diversity of snowflakes within a classifiable set of patterns.24 closely matching snow crystals have been observed.25 nakaya developed a crystal morphology diagram relating crystal shapes to the temperature and moisture conditions under which they formed which is summarized in the following table.1 dendrites hollow prisms needles solid plates dendrites solid plates prisms magono and lee devised a classification of freshly formed snow crystals that includes 80 distinct shapes they documented each with micrographs.29 accumulation snow accumulates from a series of snow events punctuated by freezing and thawing over areas that are cold enough to retain snow seasonally or perennially major snow-prone areas include the arctic and antarctic the northern hemisphere and alpine regions the liquid equivalent of snowfall may be evaluated using a snow gauge30 or with a standard rain gauge adjusted for winter by removal of a funnel and inner cylinder.31 both types of gauges melt the accumulated snow and report the amount of water collected.32 at some automatic weather stations an ultrasonic snow depth sensor may be used to augment the precipitation gauge.33 snow events snowstorm intensity may be categorized by visibility and depth of accumulation.39 snowfall's intensity is determined by visibility as follows:40 the international classification for seasonal snow on the ground defines height of new snow as the depth of freshly fallen snow in centimeters as measured with a ruler that accumulated on a snowboard during an observation period of 24 hours or other observation interval after the measurement the snow is cleared from the board and the board is placed flush with the snow surface to provide an accurate measurement at the end of the next interval.4 melting compacting blowing and drifting contribute to the difficulty of measuring snowfall.41 distribution records the following are world records regarding snowfall and snowflakes metamorphosis after deposition snow progresses on one of two paths that determine its fate either ablation mostly by melting or transitioning from firn multi-year snow into glacier ice during this transition snow is a highly porous sintered material made up of a continuous ice structure and a continuously connected pore space forming together the snow microstructure almost always near its melting temperature a snowpack is continually transforming these properties in a process known as metamorphism wherein all three phases of water may coexist including liquid water partially filling the pore space.4 starting as a powdery deposition snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight be blown by the wind sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and refreezing water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals known as hoar frost during cold still conditions.49 seasonal snowpack firn movement there are four main mechanisms for movement of deposited snow drifting of unsintered snow avalanches of accumulated snow on steep slopes snowmelt during thaw conditions and the movement of glaciers after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice drifting when powdery snow drifts with the wind from the location where it originally fell53 forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations.54 after attaching to hillsides blown snow can evolve into a snow slab which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.55 avalanche an avalanche also called a snowslide or snowslip is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack slab avalanche when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening loose snow avalanche after initiation avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow if the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche which is a type of gravity current they occur in three major mechanisms:55 snowmelt many rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt this often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding56 during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain west of the us or most of iran and afghanistan very low flow for the rest of the year in contrast if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas the melt continues through the warm season with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.57 glaciers snow science scientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the physics of chemical bonds and clouds the distribution accumulation metamorphosis and ablation of snowpacks and the contribution of snowmelt to river hydraulics and ground hydrology in doing so they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers who adapt vehicles and structures to snow by agronomists who address the availability of snowmelt to agriculture and those who design equipment for sporting activities on snow scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack a sub-specialty is avalanches which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people alike snow science addresses how snow forms its distribution and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time scientists improve storm forecasting study global snow cover and its effect on climate glaciers and water supplies around the world the study includes physical properties of the material as it changes bulk properties of in-place snow packs and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover in doing so they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.58 measurement and classification in the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations observations can describe features caused by wind water percolation or snow unloading from trees.water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the international classification for seasonal snow on the ground includes are snow height snow water equivalent snow strength and extent of snow cover each has a designation with code and detailed description the classification extends the prior classifications of nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table:4 hexagonal or irregular in shape accretion of supercooled water droplets or milky glazed surface mostly small spheroids needles pointing into the wind thin breakable crust forms on snow surface if process continues long enough all are formed in cloud except for rime which forms on objects exposed to supercooled moisture it also has a more extensive classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow the categories include both natural and man-made snow types descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density which together define the snow type and other physical properties thus at any one time the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them physical properties include microstructure grain size and shape snow density liquid water content and temperature.4 satellite data remote sensing of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery multi-faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed the science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.1 models global climate change models gcms incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations some important aspects of snow cover include its albedo reflectivity of incident radiation including light and insulating qualities which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice as of 2011 the melt phase of gcm snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt such as vegetation cover and terrain these models typically derive snow water equivalent swe in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover.1 the international classification for seasonal snow on the ground defines swe as the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely.4 given the importance of snowmelt to agriculture hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack melting processes and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux ambient temperature wind and precipitation initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent swe more recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute qm the energy available for melt this requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to qm.1 effects on human activity snow affects human activity in four major areas transportation agriculture structures and sports most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture structures may fail under snow loads humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes transportation highway in the late 20th century an estimated $2 billion was spent annually in north america on roadway winter maintenance owing to snow and other winter weather events according to a 1994 report by kuemmel the study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 us states and nine canadian provinces it assessed the policies practices and equipment used for winter maintenance it found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in europe.60 the dominant effect of snow on vehicle contact with the road is diminished friction this can be improved with the use of snow tires which have a tread designed to compact snow in a manner that enhances traction however the key to maintaining a roadway that can accommodate traffic during and after a snow event is an effective anti-icing program that employs both chemicals and plowing.60 the fhwa manual of practice for an effective anti-icing program emphasizes anti-icing procedures that prevent the bonding of snow and ice to the road key aspects of the practice include understanding anti-icing in light of the level of service to be achieved on a given roadway the climatic conditions to be encountered and the different roles of deicing anti-icing and abrasive materials and applications and employing anti-icing toolboxes one for operations one for decision-making and another for personnel the elements to the toolboxes are:61 the manual offers matrices that address different types of snow and the rate of snowfall to tailor applications appropriately and efficiently snow fences constructed upwind of roadways control snow drifting by causing windblown drifting snow to accumulate in a desired place they are also used on railways additionally farmers and ranchers use snow fences to create drifts in basins for a ready supply of water in the spring.6263 aviation in order to keep airports open during winter storms runways and taxiways require snow removal unlike roadways where chloride chemical treatment is common to prevent snow from bonding to the pavement surface such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft consequently mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows given the width of runways on airfields that handle large aircraft vehicles with large plow blades an echelon of plow vehicles or rotary snowplows are used to clear snow on runways and taxiways terminal aprons may require 6 hectares 15 acres or more to be cleared.64 properly equipped aircraft are able to fly through snowstorms under instrument flight rules prior to takeoff during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages which may compromise the safety of the aircraft and its occupants.65 in flight aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds66 these include pulsing pneumatic boots electro-thermal areas that generate heat and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.67 rail railroads have traditionally employed two types of snow plows for clearing track the wedge plow which casts snow to both sides and the rotary snowplow which is suited for addressing heavy snowfall and casting snow far to one side or the other prior to the invention of the rotary snowplow ca 1865 it required multiple locomotives to drive a wedge plow through deep snow subsequent to clearing the track with such plows a flanger is used to clear snow from between the rails that are below the reach of the other types of plow where icing may affect the steel-to-steel contact of locomotive wheels on track abrasives typically sand have been used to provide traction on steeper uphills.68 trucks plowing snow on a highway in indiana airport snow-clearing operations include plowing and brushing swiss low-profile train-mounted snowplow snow roads and runways snow can be compacted to form a snow road and be part of a winter road route for vehicles to access isolated communities or construction projects during the winter.70 snow can also be used to provide the supporting structure and surface for a runway as with the phoenix airfield in antarctica the snow-compacted runway is designed to withstand approximately 60 wheeled flights of heavy-lift military aircraft a year.71 agriculture snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator conserving the heat of the earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring providing water for crop growth both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers which supply irrigation canals.1 the following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which irrigation depends the ganges many of whose tributaries rise in the himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast india72 the indus river which rises in tibet73 and provides irrigation water to pakistan from rapidly retreating tibetan glaciers74 and the colorado river which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the rocky mountains75 and provides irrigation water to some 4 million acres 1.6 million hectares.76 structures snow is an important consideration for loads on structures to address these european countries employ eurocode 1 actions on structures  part 1-3 general actions  snow loads.77 in north america asce minimum design loads for buildings and other structures gives guidance on snow loads.78 both standards employ method that translate maximum expected ground snow loads onto design loads for roofs roofs snow loads and icings are two principal issues for roofs snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it snow loads  the minimum design loads for buildings and other structures gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads:78 it gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby measured values the eurocode 1 uses similar methodologies starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of europe.77 icings  roofs must also be designed to avoid ice dams which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof under the insulating blanket of snow until it reaches below freezing temperature air typically at the eaves when the meltwater reaches the freezing air ice accumulates forming a dam and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam.79 ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams the melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.8081 utility lines in areas with trees utility distribution lines on poles are less susceptible to snow loads than they are subject to damage from trees falling on them felled by heavy wet snow.82 elsewhere snow can accrete on power lines as sleeves of rime ice engineers design for such loads which are measured in kg/m lb/ft and power companies have forecasting systems that anticipate types of weather that may cause such accretions rime ice may be removed manually or by creating a sufficient short circuit in the affected segment of power lines to melt the accretions.8384 sports and recreation snow figures into many winter sports and forms of recreation including skiing and sledding common examples include cross-country skiing alpine skiing snowboarding snow shoeing and snowmobiling the design of the equipment used typically relies on the bearing strength of snow as with skis or snowboards and contends with the coefficient of friction of snow to allow sliding often enhance by ski waxes increasingly ski resorts are relying on snowmaking the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes.86 snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts.87 this allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring the production of snow requires low temperatures the threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases wet bulb temperature is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption thereby limiting its use.88 warfare snow affects warfare conducted in winter alpine environments or at high latitudes the main factors are impaired visibility for acquiring targets during falling snow enhanced visibility of targets against snowy backgrounds for targeting and mobility for both mechanized and infantry troops snowfall can severely inhibit the logistics of supplying troops as well snow can also provide cover and fortification against small-arms fire.90 noted winter warfare campaigns where snow and other factors affected the operations include finnish ski troops during the invasion of finland by the soviet union army vehicles coping with snow during the battle of the bulge of world war ii norwegian military preparations during the 2009 cold response exercise navy seals training for winter warfare at mammoth mountain california effects on ecosystems both plant and animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are dormancy seasonal dieback survival of seeds and for animals are hibernation insulation anti-freeze chemistry storing food drawing on reserves from within the body and clustering for mutual heat.99 plant life snow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and conversely the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation tree branches especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun snow affects vegetation in several ways the presence of stored water can promote growth yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it furthermore avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.1 animal life extraterrestrial snow extraterrestrial snow includes

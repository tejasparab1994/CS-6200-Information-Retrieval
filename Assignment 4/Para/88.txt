pacific ocean the pacific ocean is the largest and deepest of earth's oceanic divisions it extends from the arctic ocean in the north to the southern ocean or depending on definition to antarctica in the south and is bounded by asia and australia in the west and the americas in the east  contents  historyedit early migrationsedit european explorationedit new imperialismedit in oceania france got a leading position as imperial power after making tahiti and new caledonia protectorates in 1842 and 1853 respectively.23 after navy visits to easter island in 1875 and 1887 chilean navy officer policarpo toro managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into chile with native rapanui in 1888 by occupying easter island chile joined the imperial nations.24p53 by 1900 nearly all pacific islands were in control of britain france united states germany japan and chile.23 although the united states gained control of guam and the philippines from spain in 189825 japan controlled most of the western pacific by 1914 and occupied many other islands during world war ii however by the end of that war japan was defeated and the u.s pacific fleet was the virtual master of the ocean since the end of world war ii many former colonies in the pacific have become independent states geographyedit along the pacific ocean's irregular western margins lie many seas the largest of which are the celebes sea coral sea east china sea philippine sea sea of japan south china sea sulu sea tasman sea and yellow sea the indonesian seaway including the strait of malacca and torres strait joins the pacific and the indian ocean to the west and drake passage and the strait of magellan link the pacific with the atlantic ocean on the east to the north the bering strait connects the pacific with the arctic ocean.30 as the pacific straddles the 180th meridian the west pacific or western pacific near asia is in the eastern hemisphere while the east pacific or eastern pacific near the americas is in the western hemisphere.31 the southern pacific ocean harbors the southeast indian ridge crossing from south of australia turning into the pacific-antarctic ridge north of the south pole and merges with another ridge south of south america to form the east pacific rise which also connects with another ridge south of north america which overlooks the juan de fuca ridge for most of magellan's voyage from the strait of magellan to the philippines the explorer indeed found the ocean peaceful however the pacific is not always peaceful many tropical storms batter the islands of the pacific.32 the lands around the pacific rim are full of volcanoes and often affected by earthquakes.33 tsunamis caused by underwater earthquakes have devastated many islands and in some cases destroyed entire towns.34 bordering countries and territoriesedit sovereign nationsedit 1 the status of taiwan and china is disputed for more information see political status of taiwan territoriesedit landmasses and islandsedit this ocean has most of the islands in the world there are about 25000 islands in the pacific ocean.373839 the islands entirely within the pacific ocean can be divided into three main groups known as micronesia melanesia and polynesia micronesia which lies north of the equator and west of the international date line includes the mariana islands in the northwest the caroline islands in the center the marshall islands to the west and the islands of kiribati in the southeast.4041 melanesia to the southwest includes new guinea the world's second largest island after greenland and by far the largest of the pacific islands the other main melanesian groups from north to south are the bismarck archipelago the solomon islands santa cruz vanuatu fiji and new caledonia.42 the largest area polynesia stretching from hawaii in the north to new zealand in the south also encompasses tuvalu tokelau samoa tonga and the kermadec islands to the west the cook islands society islands and austral islands in the center and the marquesas islands tuamotu mangareva islands and easter island to the east.43 islands in the pacific ocean are of four basic types continental islands high islands coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms continental islands lie outside the andesite line and include new guinea the islands of new zealand and the philippines some of these islands are structurally associated with nearby continents high islands are of volcanic origin and many contain active volcanoes among these are bougainville hawaii and the solomon islands.44 the coral reefs of the south pacific are low-lying structures that have built up on basaltic lava flows under the ocean's surface one of the most dramatic is the great barrier reef off northeastern australia with chains of reef patches a second island type formed of coral is the uplifted coral platform which is usually slightly larger than the low coral islands examples include banaba formerly ocean island and makatea in the tuamotu group of french polynesia.4546 pacific ocean up sun from the rocks point reyes headlands point reyes national seashore california tahuna maru islet french polynesia los molinos on the coast of southern chile water characteristicsedit climateedit the climate patterns of the northern and southern hemispheres generally mirror each other the trade winds in the southern and eastern pacific are remarkably steady while conditions in the north pacific are far more varied with for example cold winter temperatures on the east coast of russia contrasting with the milder weather off british columbia during the winter months due to the preferred flow of ocean currents.54 in the tropical western pacific the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the asian landmass.56 worldwide tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest however each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns on a worldwide scale may is the least active month while september is the most active month november is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active.57 the pacific hosts the two most active tropical cyclone basins which are the northwestern pacific and the eastern pacific pacific hurricanes form south of mexico sometimes striking the western mexican coast and occasionally the southwestern united states between june and october while typhoons forming in the northwestern pacific moving into southeast and east asia from may to december tropical cyclones also form in the south pacific basin where they occasionally impact island nations in the arctic icing from october to may can present a hazard for shipping while persistent fog occurs from june to december.58 a climatological low in the gulf of alaska keeps the southern coast wet and mild during the winter months the westerlies and associated jet stream within the mid-latitudes can be particularly strong especially in the southern hemisphere due to the temperature difference between the tropics and antarctica59 which records the coldest temperature readings on the planet in the southern hemisphere because of the stormy and cloudy conditions associated with extratropical cyclones riding the jet stream it is usual to refer to the westerlies as the roaring forties furious fifties and shrieking sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude.60 geologyedit the ocean was first mapped by abraham ortelius he called it maris pacifici following ferdinand magellan's description of it as a pacific sea during his circumnavigation from 1519 to 1522 to magellan it seemed much more calm pacific than the atlantic.61 the andesite line is the most significant regional distinction in the pacific a petrologic boundary it separates the deeper mafic igneous rock of the central pacific basin from the partially submerged continental areas of felsic igneous rock on its margins.62 the andesite line follows the western edge of the islands off california and passes south of the aleutian arc along the eastern edge of the kamchatka peninsula the kuril islands japan the mariana islands the solomon islands and new zealand's north island.6364 the dissimilarity continues northeastward along the western edge of the andes cordillera along south america to mexico returning then to the islands off california indonesia the philippines japan new guinea and new zealand lie outside the andesite line within the closed loop of the andesite line are most of the deep troughs submerged volcanic mountains and oceanic volcanic islands that characterize the pacific basin here basaltic lavas gently flow out of rifts to build huge dome-shaped volcanic mountains whose eroded summits form island arcs chains and clusters outside the andesite line volcanism is of the explosive type and the pacific ring of fire is the world's foremost belt of explosive volcanism.40 the ring of fire is named after the several hundred active volcanoes that sit above the various subduction zones the pacific ocean is the only ocean which is almost totally bounded by subduction zones only the antarctic and australian coasts have no nearby subduction zones geological historyedit the pacific ocean was born 750 million years ago at the breakup of rodinia although it is generally called the panthalassic ocean until the breakup of pangea about 200 million years ago.65 the oldest pacific ocean floor is only around 180 ma old with older crust subducted by now.66 seamount chainsedit economyedit the exploitation of the pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths in shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of australia and new zealand petroleum and natural gas are extracted and pearls are harvested along the coasts of australia japan papua new guinea nicaragua panama and the philippines although in sharply declining volume in some cases.67 fishingedit fish are an important economic asset in the pacific the shallower shoreline waters of the continents and the more temperate islands yield herring salmon sardines snapper swordfish and tuna as well as shellfish.68 overfishing has become a serious problem in some areas for example catches in the rich fishing grounds of the okhotsk sea off the russian coast have been reduced by at least half since the 1990s as a result of overfishing.69 environmental issuesedit the quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east pacific ocean increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.70 marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals or particles the main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their waste.71 the rivers then empty into the ocean often also bringing chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture the excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.72 marine debris also known as marine litter is human-created waste that has ended up floating in a lake sea ocean or waterway oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.71 in addition the pacific ocean has served as the crash site of satellites including mars

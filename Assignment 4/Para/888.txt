sevastopol crimea and his father yuri borisovich kaleri is deceased kaleri enjoys running reading and gardening.1 educationedit in 1979 kaleri graduated from the moscow institute of physics and technology dolgoprudny moscow region as a specialist in aircraft flight dynamics and control in 1983 he completed post-graduate studies at the same institute as a specialist in the field of mechanics of fluids and plasma experienceedit in 1979 he was hired by the energia corporation and worked on the mir space station he participated in development of design and engineering documentation full-scale tests of the mir kaleri is a skilled programmer.2 cosmonaut careeredit kaleri was selected as the energia rsc cosmonaut candidate in april 1984 between 1985 and 1986 he completed basic training and evaluation at the gagarin cosmonaut training center in 1987 he was qualified for flight assignment as a test cosmonaut kaleri took a training course for a spaceflight aboard the mir orbital station as a backup crew flight engineer of the mir-3 mission from 1 april to 9 december 1987 he took a training course for a spaceflight aboard the mir as a backup crew flight engineer of the mir-9 mission from january to april 1991 from 8 october 1991 to 25 february 1992 kaleri was training as a primary crew flight engineer for the mir-11 mission kaleri has participated in three extended missions aboard the mir space station in 1992 he participated in a 145-day flight aboard the soyuz-tm-14 spacecraft and the mir between 17 august 1996 to 2 march 1997 kaleri spent 197-days in space aboard the soyuz-tm-24 spacecraft and the mir as the mir-22 mission flight engineer in 2000 kaleri performed his third spaceflight aboard the soyuz-tm-30 spacecraft and the mir as the mir-28 mission flight engineer expedition 8edit expedition 25/26edit kaleri was a member flight engineer of the iss expedition 25/26 that was launched on 7 october 2010 from baikonur cosmodrome aboard soyuz tma-01m spacecraft together with cosmonaut oleg skripochka and nasa astronaut scott kelly.4 he served as the soyuz commander the mission marked kaleri's fifth flight into space he arrived at the iss after the soyuz spacecraft linked up with the space station at 00:01 utc on 10 october 2010.5 he remained in the iss till march 2011 during their mission kaleri and the rest of the expedition 25/26 crew participated in a wide array of research including fundamental physics biometric experiments and investigations of crystal growth in space as well as education outreach.6 spacewalksedit kaleri has participated in five spacewalks and has accumulated 23 eva hours on 8 july 1992 at 12:38 utc kaleri started his first career spacewalk during the spacewalk he and cosmonaut aleksandr viktorenko inspected some of mir's gyrodynes.7 the spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 3 minutes on 2 december 1996 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut valery korzun completed a 5 hours 57 minutes long spacewalk the main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the mir station.8 the spacewalk was kaleri's second career spacewalk on 9 december 1996 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut valery korzun completed a 6 hours 36 minutes long spacewalk the spacewalk began at 13:50 utc and ended at 20:28 utc during the spacewalk the two cosmonauts completed connecting the solar array and attached a new kurs docking antenna subsequently used to guide progress vehicles docking with mir they also repaired the transceiver system that the mir crew used to talk to amateur operators all around the world.8 on 12 may 2000 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut sergei zalyotin completed a five-hour spacewalk to inspect the exterior of mir the two spacewalkers also tested a glue which would have been useful to seal tiny cracks and applied the new airtight sealant to a special panel imitating a damaged section in mir's skin.9 the two cosmonauts also examined the exterior of the progress m1-2 cargo spacecraft on 26 february 2004 kaleri and nasa astronaut michael foale floated outside the iss from the pirs docking compartment airlock.10 the spacewalk began at 4:17 est and foale and kaleri were able to complete all but two of their planned tasks swapping out experiment packages and mounting an instrumented dummy torso on the station's hull to measure the radiation environment faced by spacewalking astronauts although the spacewalk was originally planned for 5 hours and 30 minutes it was cut short due to a cooling system malfunction in kaleri's spacesuit kaleri reported seeing drops of water on the inside of his spacesuit's visor.11 the spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 55 minutes the excursion was the fifth career spacewalk for kaleri honours and awardsedit

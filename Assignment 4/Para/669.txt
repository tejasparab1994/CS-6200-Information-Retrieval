european cultures and its growing economic development  contents  historyedit precolonial periodedit there is evidence of human activity in the area about 40000 years ago at the time europeans arrived marking the end of the pre-columbian era around 1600 there were many separate native american tribes the largest being the cherokee and the catawba and the total population being up to 20000.8 up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of siouan background along the savannah river were the apalachee yuchi and the yamasee further west were the cherokee and along the catawba river the catawba these tribes were village-dwellers relying on agriculture as their primary food source.8 the cherokee lived in wattle and daub houses made with wood and clay roofed with wood or thatched grass.9 explorationedit the spanish are the first europeans in the area exploring from june 24 to july 14 1521 a land around winyah bay named according to the captive francisco chicora in struggle with nineteen other neighboring peoples whose names have been also transmitted without it being possible to identify them with certainty they found in october 8 1526 san miguel de gualdape near what is now georgetown south carolina it is the first european settlement in what is now mainland usa established with five hundred settlers it was abandoned eight months later by one hundred and fifty survivors in 1540 hernando de soto explored the region and the maintown of cofitachequi where he captured the queen of the maskoki and the chelaque who had welcomed him colonizationedit sixty years later in 1629 king of england charles i established the province of carolina an area covering what is now south and north carolina georgia and tennessee in 1663 charles ii granted the land to eight lords proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660.10 anthony ashley cooper plans the grand model for the province of carolina and writes the fundamental constitutions of carolina.11 his utopia is inspired by john locke the major investor in the english slave-trade through the royal african company in the 1670s english planters from bermuda established themselves near what is now charleston settlers built rice plantations in the south carolina lowcountry east of the atlantic seaboard fall line settlers came from all over europe plantation labor was done by african slaves who formed the majority of the population by 1720.12 another cash crop was the indigo plant a plant source of blue dye developed by eliza lucas meanwhile in upstate south carolina west of the fall line was settled by small farmers and traders who displaced native american tribes westward colonists overthrew the proprietors absentee english landowners rule seeing more direct representation in 1719 the colony was officially made a crown colony in 1729 north carolina was split off into a separate colony southern carolina prospered from the fertility of the low country and the harbors such as that at charleston it allowed religious toleration encouraging settlements spread and trade in deerskin lumber and beef thrived rice cultivation was developed on a large scale by the second half of the 1700s south carolina was one of the richest of what were about to become the thirteen colonies.12 the american revolutionedit on march 26 1776 the colony adopted the constitution of south carolina13 electing john rutledge as the state's first president in february 1778 south carolina became the first state to ratify the articles of confederation14 the initial governing document of the united states and in may 1788 south carolina ratified the united states constitution becoming the eighth state to enter the union antebellumedit america's first census in 1790 put the state's population at nearly 250000 by the 1800 census the population had increased 38 per cent to nearly 340000 of which 146000 were slaves at that time south carolina had the largest population of jews in the 16 united states mostly based in savannah and charleston17 the latter being the country's fifth largest city.18 in the antebellum period before the civil war the state's economy and population grew cotton became an important crop after the invention of the cotton gin while nominally democratic from 1790 until 1865 wealthy male landowners were in control of south carolina for example a man was not eligible to sit in the state house of representatives unless he possessed an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 negroes or at least 150 pounds sterling.19 columbia the new state capital was founded in the center of the state and the state legislature first met there in 1790 the town grew after it was connected to charleston by the santee canal in 1800 one of the first canals in the united states as dissatisfaction with the federal government grew in the 1820s john c calhoun became a leading proponent of states rights limited government nullification of the us constitution and free trade in 1832 the ordinance of nullification declared federal tariff laws unconstitutional and not to be enforced in the state leading to the nullification crisis the federal force bill was enacted to use whatever military force necessary to enforce federal law in the state bringing south carolina back into line in the united states presidential election of 1860 voting was sharply divided with the south voting for the southern democrats and the north for abraham lincoln's republican party lincoln was anti-slavery did not acknowledge the right to secession and would not yield federal property in southern states southern secessionists believed lincoln's election meant long-term doom for their slavery-based agrarian economy and social system.20 lincoln was elected president on 6 november 1860 the state house of representatives immediately passed the resolution to call the election of abraham lincoln as u.s president a hostile act 9 november 186021 and within weeks south carolina became the first state to declare secession from the us.12 on april 12 1861 confederate southern batteries began shelling the union federal northern or us fort sumter in charleston harbor after us troops refusal to leave the fort peacefully and the american civil war began in november of that year the union attacked port royal sound and soon occupied beaufort county and the neighboring sea islands for the rest of the war this area served as a union base and staging point for other operations whites abandoned their plantations22 leaving behind about 10000 slaves several northern charities partnered with the federal government to help these people run the cotton farms themselves under the port royal experiment workers were paid by the pound harvested and thus became the first former slaves freed by the union forces to earn wages.23 at the end of the war in early 1865 the troops of general william tecumseh sherman marched across the state devastating plantations and most of columbia in texas vs white 1869 the supreme court ruled that the ordinances of secession including that of south carolina were invalid and thus those states had never left the union however south carolina did not regain representation in congress until that date until the 1868 presidential election south carolina's legislature not the voters chose the state's electors for the presidential election south carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner on october 19 1871 president ulysses s grant suspended habeas corpus in nine south carolina counties under the authority of the ku klux klan act.25 led by grant's attorney general amos t akerman hundreds of klansmen were arrested while 2000 klansmen fled the state.25 this was done in order to suppress klan violence against african-american and white voters in the south.25 in the mid to late 1870s white democrats used paramilitary groups such as the red shirts to intimidate and terrorize black voters they regained political control of the state under conservative white redeemers and pro-business bourbon democrats in 1877 the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the compromise of 1877 that ended reconstruction populist and agrarian movementsedit the state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the populist and agrarian movements of the 1890s a republican-populist biracial coalition took power away from white democrats temporarily to prevent that from happening again democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes residency and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls by 1896 only 5500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls although they constituted a majority of the state's population.26 the 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement the 782509 african american citizens comprised more than 58 of the state's population but they were essentially without any political representation in the jim crow society.27 the 1895 constitution overturned local representative government reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government effectively ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegations for each county as each county had one state senator that person had considerable power the counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975.28 governor pitchfork ben tillman a populist led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites although he controlled democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers during the constitutional convention in 1895 he supported another man's proposal that the state adopt a one-drop rule as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known african ancestry some members of the convention realized that prominent white families with some african ancestry could be affected by such legislation in terms similar to a debate in virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal which was dropped george dionysius tillman said the following in opposition if the law is made as it now stands respectable families in aiken barnwell colleton and orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified at least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge they have sent good soldiers to the confederate army and are now landowners and taxpayers those men served creditably and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way it is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded caucasian on the floor of this convention every member has in him a certain mixture of colored blood the pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose it would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation of scandal horror feud and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote perhaps obsolete trace of negro blood the doors would be open to scandal malice and greed to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that a or b had negro blood in their veins any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.29303132 the state postponed such a one-drop law for years virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924 forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white 20th centuryedit early in the 20th century south carolina developed a thriving textile industry the state also converted its agricultural base from cotton to more profitable crops attracted large military bases through its powerful democratic congressional delegation part of the one-party south following disfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century and created tourism industries during the early part of the 20th century thousands of african americans left south carolina and other southern states for jobs and better opportunities in northern midwestern and western cities in total from 1910 to 1970 6.5 million blacks left the south in the great migration by 1930 south carolina had a white majority33 for the first time since 1708 the struggle of the civil rights movement took place in south carolina as well as other places in the south south carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the nineteenth amendment 1920 giving women the right to vote the south carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on july 1 1969 21st centuryedit as of 2015 south carolina had one of the lowest percentages among all states of women in state legislature

into three geographic areas from east to west the atlantic coastal plain the piedmont and the blue ridge mountains locally the coastal plain is referred to as the low country and the other two regions as up country.39 the atlantic coastal plain makes up two-thirds of the state its eastern border is the sea islands a chain of tidal and barrier islands the border between the low country and the up country is defined by the atlantic seaboard fall line which marks the limit of navigable rivers the state's coastline contains many salt marshes and estuaries as well as natural ports such as georgetown and charleston an unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of carolina bays the origins of which are uncertain the bays tend to be oval lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation the terrain is flat and the soil is composed entirely of recent sediments such as sand silt and clay areas with better drainage make excellent farmland though some land is swampy the natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the middle atlantic coastal forests ecoregion.40 just west of the coastal plain is the sandhills region the sandhills are remnants of coastal dunes from a time when the land was sunken or the oceans were higher the upstate region contains the roots of an ancient eroded mountain chain it is generally hilly with thin stony clay soils and contains few areas suitable for farming much of the piedmont was once farmed due to the changing economics of farming much of the land is now reforested in loblolly pine for the lumber industry these forests are part of the southeastern mixed forests ecoregion.40 at the southeastern edge of the piedmont is the fall line where rivers drop to the coastal plain the fall line was an important early source of water power mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities including the capital columbia the larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line providing a trade route for mill towns the northwestern part of the piedmont is also known as the foothills the cherokee parkway is a scenic driving route through this area this is where table rock state park is located

executive legislative and judicial branches also relevant are the state constitution law enforcement agencies federal representation state finances and state taxes south carolina has historically had a weak executive branch and a strong legislature before 1865 governors in south carolina were appointed by the general assembly and held the title president of state. the 1865 constitution changed this process requiring a popular election local governments were also weak but the 1867 constitution passed during the reconstruction era extended democratization by establishing home rule for counties which were established from the former designated districts of the state the 1895 state constitution overturned this reducing the role of counties and strengthening the relative role of the state legislature essentially the counties were agents of the state and ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegation for each county.28 they are geographically comprehensive all areas of the state are included in counties as each county had one state senator that position was particularly powerful this status continued until 1973 when the state constitution was amended to provide for home rule for the counties during this time the state had changed with increasing urbanization but rural counties retained proportionally more power as the legislature was based in representatives elected from counties rather than population districts.85 the federal court case reynolds v sims 1964 established the one-man one-vote concept for electoral representation at the state level legislators were now supposed to represent more or less equal numbers of people.85 residents of urban areas had been found to be markedly underrepresented in the legislature under the county-based system reapportionment made obvious the need for other changes to county structure leading to the legislature passing the constitutional amendment the home rule act of 1975 implemented the amendment giving more power to the counties with urbanization their governments have become increasingly important in the state.85 several changes to the state constitution have affected the office of the governor and the cabinet in 1926 the governor's term was extended from two to four years in 1982 the governor was allowed to run for a second succeeding term in 1993 the state passed an

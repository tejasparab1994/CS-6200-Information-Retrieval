haiti  contents  etymologyedit the name was restored by haitian revolutionary jean-jacques dessalines as the official name of independent saint-domingue as a tribute to the amerindian predecessors.37 in french haiti's nickname is the pearl of the antilles la perle des antilles because of both its natural beauty38 and the amount of wealth it accumulated for the kingdom of france as it was considered the richest colony owned by any of the european powers at the time.39 historyedit pre-columbian historyedit the sailors carried endemic eurasian infectious diseases the natives lacked immunity to these new diseases and died in great numbers in epidemics.4445 the first recorded smallpox epidemic in the americas erupted on hispaniola in 1507.46 the encomienda system forced natives to work in gold mines and plantations.47 as a gateway to the caribbean hispaniola became a haven for pirates during the early colonial period the western part of the island was settled by french buccaneers among them was bertrand d'ogeron who succeeded in growing tobacco he recruited many french colonial families from martinique and guadeloupe european nations were competing for control in the new world in the caribbean as well as in north america france and spain settled their hostilities on the island by way of the treaty of ryswick of 1697 and divided hispaniola between them france received the western third and subsequently named it saint-domingue the french equivalent of santo domingo the spanish colony of hispaniola and the name of its patron saint saint dominic.50 to develop it into sugarcane plantations the french imported thousands of slaves from africa sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century by 1789 approximately 40000 white colonists lived in saint-domingue in contrast by 1763 the white population of french canada a vast territory had numbered 65000.51 the whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of african slaves they had imported to work on their plantations which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane in the north of the island slaves were able to retain many ties to african cultures religion and language these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported africans blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one the french-enacted code noir black code prepared by jean-baptiste colbert and ratified by louis xiv had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms saint-domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies one-third of newly imported africans died within a few years.52 many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever.53 they had low birth rates and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of slavery.citation needed as in its louisiana colony the french colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color the mixed-race descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves and later mixed-race women over time many were released from slavery they established a separate social class white french creole fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to france for their education some men of color were admitted into the military more of the free people of color lived in the south of the island near port-au-prince and many intermarried within their community they frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen and began to own some property some became slave holders the free people of color petitioned the colonial government to expand their rights slaves that made it to haiti from the trans-atlantic journey and slaves born in haiti were first documented in haiti's archives and transferred to france's ministry of defense and the ministry of foreign affairs as of 2015update these records are in the national archives of france according to the 1788 census haiti's population consisted of nearly 25000 whites 22000 free coloureds and 700000 slaves.citation needed inspired by the french revolution of 1789 and principles of the rights of man free people of color and slaves in saint-domingue and the french west indies pressed for freedom and more civil rights most important was the revolution of the slaves in saint-domingue starting in the northern plains in 1791 where africans greatly outnumbered the whites in 1792 the french government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control to build an alliance with the gens de couleur and slaves the french commissioners sonthonax and polverel abolished slavery in the colony six months later the national convention led by robespierre and the jacobins endorsed abolition and extended it to all the french colonies.54 political leaders in the united states which was a new republic itself reacted with ambivalence at times providing aid to enable planters to put down the revolt later in the revolution the us provided support to black haitian military forces with the goal of reducing french influence in north america and the caribbean.55 the independence of saint-domingue was proclaimed by dessalines on 1 january 1804.62 the exact number of deaths due to the haitian revolution is unknown dessalines was proclaimed emperor for life by his troops.63 dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others.64 once in power he ordered the massacre of most whites without regard to age or gender those who did not swear allegiance to him were slain.65 in the continuing competition for power he was assassinated by rivals on 17 october 1806.66 only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared the polish soldiers the majority of whom deserted from the french army and fought alongside the haitian rebels the little group of german colonists invited to the north-west region and a group of medical doctors and professionals.67 reportedly people with connections to officers in the haitian army were also spared as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men.68 fearful of the influence of the slaves revolution u.s president thomas jefferson refused to recognize the new republic as did most european nations the u.s did not officially recognize haiti for decades until after the start of the american civil war.69 the revolution led to a wave of emigration.70 in 1809 nearly 10000 refugees from saint-domingue settled en masse in new orleans.71 they doubled the city's population in addition the newly arrived slaves added to the city's african population.72 struggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce commodity crops boyer passed the code rural which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land enter the towns or start farms or shops of their own following the revolution many peasants wanted to have their own farms rather than work on plantations.7778 the american colonization society acs encouraged free blacks in the united states to emigrate to haiti starting in september 1824 more than 6000 african americans migrated to haiti with transportation paid by the acs.79 many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the united states in july 1825 king charles x of france during a period of restoration of the monarchy sent a fleet to reconquer the island under pressure president boyer agreed to a treaty by which france formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs by an order of 17 april 1825 the king of france renounced his rights of sovereignty over santo domingo and recognized the independence of haiti.808182 though the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838 haiti was unable to finish paying off its debt until 1947 the haitian president would have had little choice as the country unknowingly to him would have been blockaded by french ships if the exchange did not go the french way after losing the support of haiti's elite boyer was ousted in 1843 a long succession of coups followed his departure to exile.citation needed83 the enforced payment to france reduced haiti's economy for years western nations did not give haiti formal diplomatic recognition both of these problems kept the haitian economy and society isolated expatriates bankrolled and armed opposing groups.84 early 20th centuryedit in the first decades of the 20th century haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to france germany and the united states fearing possible foreign intervention president woodrow wilson sent u.s marines into haiti in december 1914 just after the outbreak of world war i they removed $500000 from the haitian national bank for safe-keeping sic in new york thus giving the united states control of the bank.85 the next 5 years witnessed numerous cases of intimidation arson torture and murder of the haitian population by u.s marines and their local enforcers the gendarmerie d'haiti the u.s marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism allowing them to behave this way mary renda writes that paternalism was an assertion of authority superiority and control expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children.86 this mindset allowed the marines to act highly authoritatively in haiti and carry out atrocious acts it has been estimated that up to 15000 haitians lost their lives at the hands of the occupying forces either through armed opposition or through the 'corvee system of forced labor this system allowed the occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms at gunpoint if necessary to build roads bridges etc many resisted and were killed on the spot while others died working or due to disease and malnutrition while living in squalid work camps.87 this chapter in the two nations histories reflects the oppressive foreign policy of the united states toward its neighbors in central america and the caribbean that is often characterized as gunboat diplomacy or one of many banana wars that plagued the region in the early 20th century u.s marines were stationed in the country until 1934 a period of nineteen years and were finally ordered from the island by franklin d roosevelt as a demonstration of his good neighbor policy however the united states controlled the economy of the island and heavily influenced elections in haiti up through the 1980s.citation needed sisal was introduced to haiti and sugarcane and cotton became significant exports.88 haitian traditionalists based in rural areas were highly resistant to american-backed changes while the urban elites wanted more control together they helped secure an end to the occupation in 1934.89 the debts were still outstanding and the american financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941.90 recognition of the distinctive traditionalism of the haitian people had an influence on united states writers including eugene o'neill james weldon johnson langston hughes zora neale hurston and orson welles.91 after us forces left in 1934 dominican dictator rafael trujillo used anti-haitian sentiment as a nationalist tool in an event that became known as the parsley massacre he ordered his army to kill haitians living on the dominican side of the border.9293 between 10000 and 20000 haitians were killed.92 though he was one-quarter haitian himself trujillo continued policies against the neighboring population for some time on 27 september 194594 haiti became a founding member of the united nations successor to the league of nations in which haiti was also a founding member.9596 in the 1950s american and european tourists started to visit haiti.97 contemporary historyedit in november 1994 hurricane gordon brushed haiti dumping heavy rain and creating flash flooding that triggered mudslides gordon killed an estimated 1122 people although some estimates go as high as 2200.105106 on 12 january 2010 at 4:53pm local time haiti was struck by a magnitude-7.0 earthquake this was the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years.114 the 2010 haiti earthquake was reported to have left up to 316000 people dead and 1.6 million homeless115 though later reports found these numbers to have been grossly inflated and put the death toll between 46000 and 85000.116 the country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake and a subsequent and massive haiti cholera outbreak that was triggered when cholera-infected waste from a minustah peacekeeping station contaminated the country's main river the artibonite.117 the country has yet to fully recover due to both the severity of the damage haiti endured in 2010 as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake.118 general elections had been planned for january 2010 but were postponed due to the earthquake the elections were held on 28 november 2010 for the senate the parliament and the first round of the presidential elections the run-off between michel martelly and mirlande manigat took place on 20 march 2011 and preliminary results released on 4 april named michel martelly the winner.119 on 7 february 2016 michel martelly stepped down as president without a successor but only after a deal was reached for a provisional government and leaving prime minister evans paul in power until an interim president is chosen by both chambers of parliament.120 in 2013 haiti called for european nations to pay reparations for slavery and establish an official commission for the settlement of past wrongdoings the economist wrote any assistance to the region should be carefully targeted and should surely stem from today's needs not the wrongs of the past.121 the topic however has more than a passing reference to a country that as lord anthony gifford wrote was forced to pay compensation to the government of france.122 on 4 october 2016 hurricane matthew made landfall near les anglais making it the worst hurricane to strike the nation since hurricane cleo in 1964 the storm brought deadly winds and rain which left haiti with a large amount of damage to be repaired with all of the resources in the country destroyed haiti received aid from the united nations of around us$120 million the death total was approximately 3000 thousands of people were displaced due to damage to infrastructure also the cholera outbreak has been growing since the storm hit haiti with additional flooding after the storm cholera continued to spread beyond the control of officials the storm also caused damage to hospitals and roads which created a larger problem in helping victims and moving resources the devastation and damage that hurricane matthew caused was unpredictable and left haiti in a state of emergency geographyedit the northern region consists of the massif du nord northern massif and the plaine du nord northern plain the massif du nord is an extension of the cordillera central in the dominican republic it begins at haiti's eastern border north of the guayamouc river and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula the lowlands of the plaine du nord lie along the northern border with the dominican republic between the massif du nord and the north atlantic ocean the central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges the plateau central central plateau extends along both sides of the guayamouc river south of the massif du nord it runs from the southeast to the northwest to the southwest of the plateau central are the montagnes noires whose most northwestern part merges with the massif du nord its westernmost point is known as cap carcasse climateedit geologyedit there are blind thrust faults associated with the enriquillo-plantain garden fault system over which haiti lies.127 after the earthquake of 2010 there was no evidence of surface rupture and based on seismological geological and ground deformation data.128 environmentedit the soil erosion released from the upper catchments and deforestation have caused periodic and severe flooding in haiti as experienced for example on 17 september 2004 earlier in may that year floods had killed over 3000 people on haiti's southern border with the dominican republic.133 haiti's forests covered 60 percent of the country as recently as fifty years ago but today according to more in-depth environmental analysis the country yields approximately 30 percent tree cover a stark difference from the often cited 2 percent which has been widely circulated in discourse concerning haiti.134 scientists at the columbia university's center for international earth science information network ciesin and the united nations environment programme are working on the haiti regenerative initiative an initiative aiming to reduce poverty and natural disaster vulnerability in haiti through ecosystem restoration and sustainable resource management.135 government and politicsedit the government of haiti is a semi-presidential republic a multiparty system wherein the president of haiti is head of state elected directly by popular elections.136 the prime minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the president chosen from the majority party in the national assembly executive power is exercised by the president and prime minister who together constitute the government in 2013 the annual budget was us$1 billion.137 legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the national assembly of haiti the government is organized unitarily thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent the current structure of haiti's political system was set forth in the constitution of haiti on 29 march 1987 according to a 2006 report by the corruption perceptions index there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty in haiti the nation ranked first of all countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic corruption.140 the international red cross reports that seven out of ten haitians live on less than us$2 a day this statistic was somewhat disputed in a 2006 article about poverty in the slums of haiti written for the red cross wherein icrc officer didier revol wrote such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average haitian and haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily the disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are in the haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question for various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter for some it is because 'it's none of your business' for others they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them.141 in february 2012 haiti signaled it would seek to upgrade its observer status to full associate member status of the african union au.151 the au was reported to be planning to upgrade haiti's status from observer to associate at its june 2013 summit152 but the application had still not been ratified by may 2016.153 in 2010 the haitian national police force numbered 7000.154 the legal system for torts is based on a version of the napoleonic code.155 cabinetedit clarification needed the executive function is divided into ministries each led by a minister appointed by the prime minister and confirmed by parliament:157158159 militaryedit haiti's ministry of defense is the main body of their armed forces.160 the former haitian armed forces were demobilized in 1995 however efforts to reconstitute it are currently underway.161 the current defense force for haiti is the haitian national police which has a highly trained swat team and works alongside the haitian coast guard law enforcement and crimeedit haiti has consistently ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world on the corruption perceptions index.163 it is estimated that president baby doc duvalier his wife michelle and their agents stole us $504 million from the country's treasury between 1971 and 1986.164 similarly after the haitian army folded in 1995 the haitian national police hnp gained sole power of authority on the haitian citizens many haitians as well as observers of the haitian society believe that this monopolized power could have given way to a corrupt police force.165 similarly some media outlets alleged that millions were stolen by former president jean-bertrand aristide.166167168169 in march 2004 at the time of aristide's being kidnapped a bbc article wrote that the bush administration state department stated that aristide had been involved in drug trafficking.170 the bbc also described pyramid schemes in which haitians lost hundreds of millions in 2002 as the only real economic initiative of the aristide years.171 in 2010 the new york city police department nypd sent a team of veteran officers to haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public especially among the youth it has also helped the hnp set up a police unit in the center of delmas a neighborhood of port-au-prince.176177178 administrative divisionsedit administratively haiti is divided into ten departments the departments are listed below with the departmental capital cities in parentheses the departments are further divided into 42 arrondissements 145 communes and 571 communal sections these serve as respectively second and third-level administrative divisions.179180181 economyedit haiti's purchasing power parity gdp fell 8 in 2010 from us$12.15 billion to us$11.18 billion and the gdp per capita remained unchanged at ppp us$1200.2 despite having a viable tourist industry haiti is one of the world's poorest countries and the poorest in the americas region with poverty corruption poor infrastructure lack of health care and lack of education cited as the main sources the economy receded due to the 2010 earthquake and subsequent outbreak of cholera haiti ranked 145 of 182 countries in the 2010 united nations human development index with 57.3 of the population being deprived in at least three of the hdi's poverty measures.182 following the disputed 2000 election and accusations about president aristide's rule183 us aid to the haitian government was cut off between 2001 and 2004.184 after aristide's departure in 2004 aid was restored and the brazilian army led a united nations stabilization mission in haiti peacekeeping operation after almost four years of recession the economy grew by 1.5 in 2005.185 in september 2009 haiti met the conditions set out by the imf and world bank's heavily indebted poor countries program to qualify for cancellation of its external debt.186 more than 90 percent of the government's budget comes from an agreement with petrocaribe a venezuela-led oil alliance.187 foreign aidedit haiti received more than us$4 billion in aid from 1990 to 2003 including us$1.5 billion from the united states.188 neighboring dominican republic has also provided extensive humanitarian aid to haiti including the funding and construction of a public university192 human capital free healthcare services in the border region and logistical support after the 2010 earthquake.193 according to the un office of the special envoy for haiti as of march 2012 of humanitarian funding committed or disbursed by bilateral and multilateral donors in 2010 and 2011 only 1 has been pledged to the haitian government194 according to the 2013 cia world factbook the 2010 haiti earthquake inflicted an estimated us$7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's gdp to contract.195 the united nations states that in total us$13.34 billion has been earmarked for the crisis through 2020 though two years after the 2010 quake less than half of that amount had actually been released according to un documents as of 2015update the us government has allocated us$4 billion us$3 billion has already been spent and the rest is dedicated to longer-term projects.196 former us president bill clinton's foundation contributed us$250000 to a recycling initiative for a sister-program of ranmase lajan or picking up money by use of reverse vending machines.197 tradeedit according to the 2015 cia world factbook haiti's main import partners are dominican republic 35% us 26.8% netherlands antilles 8.7% china 7 est 2013 haiti's main export partner is the us 83.5 est 2013.198 haiti had a trade deficit of us$3 billion in 2011 or 41 of gdp.199 energyedit in 1925 the city of jacmel was the first area in the caribbean to have electricity and was subsequently dubbed the city of light.200 today haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with petrocaribe for much of its energy requirements in recent years hydroelectric solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.201 personal incomeedit the world factbook reports a shortage of skilled labor widespread unemployment and underemployment saying more than two-thirds of the labor force do not have formal jobs. it is also often stated that three-quarters of the population lives on us$2 or less per day.202 such statistical estimations could be viewed with skepticism because the average haitian and haitian family spends more than that daily.202 the world factbook also states that remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange equaling one-fifth 20% of gdp and representing more than five times the earnings from exports in 2012.203 this implies that remittances are the life-blood of the haitian economy the world bank estimates that over 80 of college graduates from haiti were living abroad in 2004.204 haiti's economy was severely impacted by the 2010 haiti earthquake which occurred on 12 january 2010 killing over 300000 and displacing 1.5 million residents.205 real estateedit in rural areas people often live in wooden huts with corrugated iron roofs outhouses are located in back of the huts in port-au-prince colorful shantytowns surround the central city and go up the mountainsides.206 the middle and upper classes live in suburbs or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments where there is urban planning many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses located behind walls embedded with metal spikes barbed wire broken glass and sometimes all three the gates to these houses are barred at night the house is locked guard dogs patrol the yard these houses are often self-sufficient as well the houses have backup generators because the electrical grid in haiti is unreliable some even have rooftop reservoirs for water as the water supply is also unreliable.206 agricultureedit haiti is the world's leading producer of vetiver a root plant used to make luxury perfumes essential oils and fragrances providing for half the world's supply.207208209 half of all haitians work in the agricultural sector.210 haiti relies upon imports for half its food needs and 80 of its rice.210 haiti exports crops such as mangoes cacao coffee papayas mahogany nuts spinach and watercress.211 agricultural products comprise 6 of all exports.199 in addition local agricultural products include corn beans cassava sweet potato peanuts pistachios bananas millet pigeon peas sugarcane rice sorghum and wood.211212 currencyedit the haitian gourde htg is the national currency the haitian dollar equates to 5 gourdes goud which is a fixed exchange rate that exists in concept only but are commonly used as informal prices tourismedit in 2014 the country received 1250000 tourists mostly from cruise ships and the industry generated us$200 million in 2014.137 in december 2014 the us state department issued a travel warning about the country noting that while thousands of american citizens safely visit haiti each year a few foreign tourists had been victims of burglary predominantly in the port-au-prince area.214 caracol industrial parkedit south korean clothing manufacturer sae-a trading co ltd one of the park's main tenants has created 5000 permanent jobs out of the 20000 projected and has built 8600 houses in the surrounding area for its workers the industrial park ultimately has the potential to create as many as 65000 jobs once fully developed.225226 infrastructureedit transportationedit according to the washington post officials from the u.s army corps of engineers said saturday 23 january 2010 that they assessed the damage from the 12 january quake in port-au-prince haiti and found that many of the roads aren't any worse than they were before because they've always been in poor condition.227 the port at port-au-prince port international de port-au-prince has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country the port's facilities include cranes large berths and warehouses but these facilities are not in good condition the port is underused possibly due to the substantially high port fees the port of saint-marc is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into haiti reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and congested port-au-prince as well as its central location relative to numerous haitian cities during the 2010 earthquake the port-au-prince port suffered widespread damage impeding aid to the victims the main pier caved in and fell into the water one of the main cranes also collapsed in the water port access roads were severely damaged as well in the past haiti used rail transport however the rail infrastructure was poorly maintained when in use and cost of rehabilitation is beyond the means of the haitian economy airportsedit bus serviceedit tap tap buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as share taxis the tap tap name comes from the sound of passengers tapping on the metal bus body to indicate they want off.229 these vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated they follow fixed routes do not leave until filled with passengers and riders can usually disembark at any point the decorations are a typically haitian form of art.230 in august 2013 the first coach bus prototype was made in haiti.231 communicationsedit water supply and sanitationedit haiti faces key challenges in the water supply and sanitation sector notably access to public services is very low their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions foreign and haitian ngos play an important role in the sector especially in rural and urban slum areas demographicsedit haiti's population was about 10.8 million according to un 2016 estimates3 with half of the population younger than age 20.233 in 1950 the first formal census gave a total population of 3.1 million.234 haiti averages approximately 350 people per square kilometer ~900 per sq mi. with its population is concentrated most heavily in urban areas coastal plains and valleys most modern haitians are descendants of former black african slaves including mulattoes who are mixed-race the remainder are of european descent and arab haitians235236 the descendants of settlers colonial remnants and contemporary immigration during wwi and wwii haitians of east asian descent or east indian origin number approximately 400+ millions of haitians live abroad in the united states dominican republic cuba canada primarily montreal bahamas france french antilles the turks and caicos jamaica puerto rico venezuela brazil suriname and french guiana there are an estimated 881500 in the united states237 800000 in the dominican republic238 300000 in cuba239 100000 in canada240 80000 in france241 and up to 80000 in the bahamas.242 there are also smaller haitian communities in many other countries including chile switzerland japan and australia in 2015 the life expectancy at birth was 63 years.243 population geneticsedit autosomal dnaedit the gene pool of haiti is about 95.5 sub-saharan african 4.3 european with the rest showing some traces of east asian genes;244 according to a 2010 autosomal genealogical dna testing y-chromosome and mitochondrial dnaedit a 2012 genetic study on haitian and jamaican y-chromosomal ancestry has revealed that both populations exhibit a predominantly sub-saharan paternal component with haplogroups a1b-v152 a3-m32 b2-m182 e1a-m33 e1b1a-m2 e2b-m98 and r1b2-v88 comprising 77.2% of the haitian and 66.7% of jamaican paternal gene pools.245 y chromosomes indicative of european ancestry i.e. haplogroups g2a*-p15 i-m258 r1b1b-m269 and t-m184 were detected at commensurate levels in haiti 20.3% and jamaica 18.9%.245 this corresponds to approximately 1 in every 5 paternal ancestors hailing from europe while y-haplogroups indicative of chinese o-m175 3.8% and indian h-m69 0.6% and l-m20 0.6% ancestry were found at significant levels in jamaica245 levantine y-haplogroups were found in haiti duffy antigensedit according to a 2008 study examining the frequency of the duffy antigen receptor for chemokines darc single nucleotide polymorphisms snps 75% of haitian women sampled exhibited the cc genotype absent among women of european ancestry at levels comparable to us african-americans 73% but more than jamaican females 63%.246247 casta discriminationedit religionedit religion in haiti according to the pew research center 2010251 the 2017 cia factbook reported that around 54.7 of haitians profess to being catholics while protestants made up about 28.5 of the population baptist 15.4% pentecostal 7.9% seventh-day adventist 3% methodist 1.5% other 0.7% other sources put the protestant population higher than this suggesting that it might have formed one-third of the population in 2001.252 moreover haiti is affected by a common latin american phenomenon i.e a protestant expansion which is largely evangelical protestant and pentecostal in nature.253254255 haitian cardinal chibly langlois is president of the national bishops conference of the catholic church vodou a religion with african roots similar to those of cuba and brazil originated during colonial times in which slaves were obliged to disguise their loa or spirits as roman catholic saints an element of a process called syncretism and is still practiced by some haitians today since the religious syncretism between catholicism and vodou it is difficult to estimate the number of vodouists in haiti.256257 languagesedit haitian creole260 which has recently undergone a standardization is spoken by virtually the entire population of haiti.261 haitian creole is one of the french-based creole languages its vocabulary is 90 derived from french but its grammar resembles that of some west african languages it also has influences from taino

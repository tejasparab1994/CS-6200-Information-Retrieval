2003 atlantic hurricane season  contents  seasonal forecastsedit pre-season outlookedit mid-season outlookedit season summaryedit no cyclones in the season had a significant impact on south america or central america however a total of eight tropical cyclones made landfall on mexico from either the atlantic or the pacific ocean which was the greatest total since the record of nine in 1971 a total of seven deaths occurred in mexico from atlantic hurricanes much of the caribbean did not receive significant impact from tropical cyclones during the season.15 systemsedit tropical storm anaedit tropical depression twoedit a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on june 6.26 tracking westward at a low latitude a disturbance along the wave axis became better organized on june 927 with reasonable favorable environmental conditions despite the time of year initially lacking a well-defined low-level circulation28 convection increased further on june 10 and the system was declared tropical depression two early on june 11 in the central tropical atlantic ocean.2629 the depression was at the time the third tropical cyclone on record to develop in the month of june to the east of the lesser antilles;30 the others were tropical depression two in 200031 ana in 1979 and a storm in 1933.30 the next such system to accomplish this would be bret in 2017 tropical storm billedit hurricane claudetteedit hurricane dannyedit tropical depression sixedit with a fast forward speed confirmation of a low-level circulation on july 20 became difficult.46 convection increased in curvature on july 2147 and several islands in the lesser antilles issued tropical storm warnings and watches after it passed north of barbados a hurricane hunters flight failed to report a closed low-level circulation and it is estimated the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave late on july 21 the remnants brought a few showers to the lesser antilles42 and after tracking into the caribbean sea redevelopment was prevented by increased wind shear.48 the northern portion of the wave axis split and developed into tropical depression seven.42 tropical depression sevenedit hurricane erikaedit tropical depression nineedit a strong tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on august 1454 and after tracking steadily westward an area of convection began to become better organized on august 18.55 after it tracked through the lesser antilles it developed into tropical depression nine on august 21 to the south of puerto rico the depression quickly showed signs of organization and forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a strong tropical storm.56 however strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly became established over the system and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on august 22 to the south of the eastern tip of the dominican republic.54 hurricane fabianedit tropical storm graceedit tropical storm henriedit hurricane isabeledit tropical depression fourteenedit in the hours subsequent to formation the convection near the center decreased as the banding features dissipated.78 dry air greatly increased over the depression and by september 9 the system was not forecast to intensify past minimal tropical storm status.79 later that day an upper-level low tracked southward to the west of the depression which increased wind shear and caused a steady north-northwest motion for the depression the circulation became elongated and separated from the convection as it passed just west of the cape verde islands75 where it brought heavy rainfall80 and on september 10 the depression dissipated.75 hurricane juanedit hurricane kateedit tropical storm larryedit tropical storm mindyedit tropical storm nicholasedit nicholas had no impact as a tropical cyclone and impact from the low that absorbed the storm was limited to rainfall gusty winds and rough surf.105 the low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into a tropical cyclone which would have been called odette however moderate wind shear prevented further development.106 tropical storm odetteedit odette was a rare december tropical storm the first since hurricane lili in 1984 that formed on december 4 in the southwest caribbean sea.12 it became the second december tropical storm on record to form in the caribbean sea after a hurricane in 1822.12107 odette strengthened and made landfall near cabo falso in the dominican republic on december 6 as a moderately strong tropical storm a day later odette became extratropical and eventually merged with a cold front.12 eight deaths were directly attributed to this tropical storm in the dominican republic due to mudslides or flash flooding in addition two deaths were indirectly caused by the storm approximately 35 of the nation's banana crop was destroyed.12 light to moderate rainfall was reported in puerto rico.108 tropical storm peteredit season effectsedit this is a table of all of the storms that have formed during the 2003 atlantic hurricane season it includes their names duration peak strength areas affected damage and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical a wave or a low and all of the damage figures are in 2003 usd storm namesedit the following names were used for named storms that formed in the north atlantic in 2003 the names not retired from this list were used again in the 2009 season this is the same list used for the 1997 season storms were named larry mindy nicholas odette and peter for the first time in 2003 names that were not assigned are marked in gray ana became the first name in the six list rotation to be used five times both ana and claudette were used in 1979 1985 1991 1997 2003 2009 and 2015 retirementedit the world meteorological organization retired three names in the spring of 2004 fabian isabel and juan they were replaced in the 2009 season by fred ida and joaquin respectively.15 the name joaquin was not used in 2009 but instead was used in the 2015 season joaquin was then retired in 2015 and replaced by julian for the 2021 season see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more

atmospheric convection atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere different lapse rates within dry and moist air lead to instability mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds cumulus cloud development and decreased surface dew points moist convection leads to thunderstorm development which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world special threats from thunderstorms include hail downbursts and tornadoes  contents  overviewedit there are a few general archetypes of atmospheric instability that are used to explain convection or lack thereof a necessary but not sufficient condition for convection is that the environmental lapse rate the rate of decrease of temperature with height is steeper than the lapse rate experienced by a rising parcel of air when this condition is met upward-displaced air parcels can become buoyant and thus experience a further upward force buoyant convection begins at the level of free convection lfc above which an air parcel may ascend through the free convective layer fcl with positive buoyancy its buoyancy turns negative at the equilibrium level el but the parcel's vertical momentum may carry it to the maximum parcel level mpl where the negative buoyancy decelerates the parcel to a stop integrating the buoyancy force over the parcel's vertical displacement yields convective available potential energy cape the joules of energy available per kilogram of potentially buoyant air cape is an upper limit for an ideal undilute parcel and the square root of twice the cape is sometimes called a thermodynamic speed limit for updrafts based on the simple kinetic energy equation however such buoyant acceleration concepts give an oversimplified view of convection drag is an opposite force to counter buoyancy 1 so that parcel ascent occurs under a balance of forces like the terminal velocity of a falling object buoyancy may be reduced by entrainment which dilutes the parcel with environmental air see the cape buoyancy and parcel links for a more in depth mathematical explanation of these processes atmospheric convection is called deep when it extends from near the surface to above the 500 hpa level generally stopping at the tropopause at around 200 hpa.1 most atmospheric deep convection occurs in the tropics as the rising branch of the hadley circulation and represents a strong local coupling between the surface and the upper troposphere which is largely absent in winter midlatitudes its counterpart in the ocean deep convection downward in the water column only occurs at a few locations.2 while less dynamically important than in the atmosphere such oceanic convection is responsible for the worldwide existence of cold water in the lowest layers of the ocean initiationedit a thermal column or thermal is a vertical section of rising air in the lower altitudes of the earth's atmosphere thermals are created by the uneven heating of the earth's surface from solar radiation the sun warms the ground which in turn warms the air directly above it the warmer air expands becoming less dense than the surrounding air mass and creating a thermal low.34 the mass of lighter air rises and as it does it cools due to its expansion at lower high-altitude pressures it stops rising when it has cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding air associated with a thermal is a downward flow surrounding the thermal column the downward moving exterior is caused by colder air being displaced at the top of the thermal another convection-driven weather effect is the sea breeze.56 thunderstormsedit warm air has a lower density than cool air so warm air rises within cooler air7 similar to hot air balloons.8 clouds form as relatively warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air as the moist air rises it cools causing some of the water vapor in the rising packet of air to condense.9 when the moisture condenses it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than its surrounding air10 continuing the cloud's ascension if enough instability is present in the atmosphere this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form which support lightning and thunder generally thunderstorms require three conditions to form moisture an unstable airmass and a lifting force heat the latent heat release from condensation is the determinate between significant convection and almost no convection at all the fact that air is generally cooler during winter months and therefore cannot hold as much water vapor and associated latent heat is why significant convection thunderstorms are infrequent in cooler areas during that period thundersnow is one situation where forcing mechanisms provide support for very steep environmental lapse rates which as mentioned before is an archetype for favored convection the small amount of latent heat released from air rising and condensing moisture in a thundersnow also serves to increase this convective potential although minimally there are also three types of thunderstorms orographic air mass and frontal boundaries and forcingedit despite the fact that there might be a layer in the atmosphere that has positive values of cape if the parcel does not reach or begin rising to that level the most significant convection that occurs in the fcl will not be realized this can occur for numerous reasons primarily it is the result of a cap or convective inhibition cin/cinh processes that can erode this inhibition are heating of the earth's surface and forcing such forcing mechanisms encourage upward vertical velocity characterized by a speed that is relatively low to what you find in a thunderstorm updraft because of this it is not the actual air being pushed to its lfc that breaks through the inhibition but rather the forcing cools the inhibition adiabatically this would counter or erode the increase of temperature with height that is present during a capping inversion forcing mechanisms that can lead to the eroding of inhibition are ones that create some sort of evacuation of mass in the upper parts of the atmosphere or a surplus of mass in the low levels of the atmosphere which would lead to upper level divergence or lower level convergence respectively upward vertical motion will often follow specifically a cold front sea/lake breeze outflow boundary or forcing through vorticity dynamics differential positive vorticity advection of the atmosphere such as with troughs both shortwave and longwave jet streak dynamics through the imbalance of coriolis and pressure gradient forces causing subgeostrophic and supergeostrophic flows can also create upward vertical velocities.there are numerous other atmospheric setups in which upward vertical velocities can be created concerns regarding severe deep moist convectionedit buoyancy is key to thunderstorm growth and is necessary for any of the severe threats within a thunderstorm there are other processes not necessarily thermodynamic that can increase updraft strength these include updraft rotation low level convergence and evacuation of mass out of the top of the updraft via strong upper level winds and the jet stream hailedit like other precipitation in cumulonimbus clouds hail begins as water droplets as the droplets rise and the temperature goes below freezing they become supercooled water and will freeze on contact with condensation nuclei a cross-section through a large hailstone shows an onion-like structure this means the hailstone is made of thick and translucent layers alternating with layers that are thin white and opaque former theory suggested that hailstones were subjected to multiple descents and ascents falling into a zone of humidity and refreezing as they were uplifted this up and down motion was thought to be responsible for the successive layers of the hailstone new research based on theory and field study has shown this is not necessarily true thus a unique trajectory in the thunderstorm is sufficient to explain the layer-like structure of the hailstone the only case in which we can discuss multiple trajectories is in a multicellular thunderstorm where the hailstone may be ejected from the top of the mother cell and captured in the updraft of a more intense daughter cell this however is an exceptional case.15 downburstedit tornadoesedit a tornado is a dangerous rotating column of air in contact with both the surface of the earth and the base of a cumulonimbus cloud thundercloud or a cumulus cloud in rare cases tornadoes come in many sizes but typically form a visible condensation funnel whose narrowest end reaches the earth and surrounded by a cloud of debris and dust.21 tornadoes despite being one of the most destructive weather phenomena are generally short-lived a long-lived tornado generally lasts no more than an hour but some have been known to last for 2 hours or longer for example the tri-state tornado due to their relatively short duration less information is known about the development and formation of tornadoes.25 measurementedit the potential for convection in the atmosphere is often measured by an atmospheric temperature/dewpoint profile with height this is often displayed on a skew-t chart or other similar thermodynamic diagram these can be plotted by a measured sounding analysis which is the sending of a radiosonde attached to a balloon into the atmosphere to take the measurements with height forecast models can also create these diagrams but are less accurate due to model uncertainties and biases and have lower spatial resolution although the temporal resolution of forecast model soundings is greater than the direct measurements where the former can have plots for intervals of up to every 3 hours and the latter as having only 2 per day although when a convective event is expected a special sounding might be taken outside of the normal schedule of 00z and then 12z..2 other forecasting concernsedit atmospheric convection can also be responsible for and have implications on a number of other weather conditions a few examples on the smaller scale would include convection mixing the planetary boundary layer pbl and allowing drier air aloft to the surface thereby decreasing dew points creating cumulus-type clouds which can limit a small amount of sunshine increasing surface winds making outflow boundaries/and other smaller boundaries more diffuse and the eastward propagation of the dryline during the day on the larger scale rising of air can lead to warm core surface lows often found in the desert southwest see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools

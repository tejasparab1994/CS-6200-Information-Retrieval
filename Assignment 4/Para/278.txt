tropical cyclone forecast model a tropical cyclone forecast model is a computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast aspects of the future state of tropical cyclones there are three types of models statistical dynamical or combined statistical-dynamic.1 dynamical models utilize powerful supercomputers with sophisticated mathematical modeling software and meteorological data to calculate future weather conditions statistical models forecast the evolution of a tropical cyclone in a simpler manner by extrapolating from historical datasets and thus can be run quickly on platforms such as personal computers statistical-dynamical models use aspects of both types of forecasting four primary types of forecasts exist for tropical cyclones track intensity storm surge and rainfall dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem track models did not show forecast skill when compared to statistical models until the 1980s statistical-dynamical models were used from the 1970s into the 1990s early models use data from previous model runs while late models produce output after the official hurricane forecast has been sent the use of consensus ensemble and superensemble forecasts lowers errors more than any individual forecast model both consensus and superensemble forecasts can use the guidance of global and regional models runs to improve the performance more than any of their respective components techniques used at the joint typhoon warning center indicate that superensemble forecasts are a very powerful tool for track forecasting  contents  statistical guidanceedit in regards to intensity forecasting the statistical hurricane intensity prediction scheme ships utilizes relationships between environmental conditions from the global forecast system gfs such as vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures climatology and persistence storm behavior via multiple regression techniques to come up with an intensity forecast for systems in the northern atlantic and northeastern pacific oceans.1 a similar model was developed for the northwest pacific ocean and southern hemisphere known as the statistical intensity prediction system stips which accounts for land interactions through the input environmental conditions from the navy operational global prediction system nogaps model.7 the version of ships with an inland decay component is known as decay ships dships the logistic growth equation model lgem uses the same input as ships but within a simplified dynamical prediction system.1 within tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting the rainfall climatology and persistence r-cliper model was developed using microwave rainfall data from polar orbiting satellites over the ocean and first-order rainfall measurements from the land to come up with a realistic rainfall distribution for tropical cyclones based on the national hurricane center's track forecast it has been operational since 2004.8 a statistical-parametric wind radii model has been developed for use at the national hurricane center and joint typhoon warning center which uses climatology and persistence to predict wind structure out to five days into the future.2 dynamical guidanceedit during 1972 the first model to forecast storm surge along the continental shelf of the united states was developed known as the special program to list the amplitude of surges from hurricanes splash.9 in 1978 the first hurricane-tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics  the movable fine-mesh mfm model  began operating.10 the quasi-lagrangian limited area qlm model is a multi-level primitive equation model using a cartesian grid and the global forecast system gfs for boundary conditions.2 in the early 1980s the assimilation of satellite-derived winds from water vapor infrared and visible satellite imagery was found to improve tropical cyclones track forecasting.11 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl hurricane model was used for research purposes between 1973 and the mid-1980s once it was determined that it could show skill in hurricane prediction a multi-year transition transformed the research model into an operational model which could be used by the national weather service for both track and intensity forecasting in 1995.12 by 1985 the sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh model had been developed for use in areas of the gulf of mexico and near the united states east coast which was more robust than the splash model.13 the beta advection model bam has been used operationally since 1987 using steering winds averaged through the 850 hpa to 200 hpa layer and the beta effect which causes a storm to drift northwest due to differences in the coriolis effect across the tropical cyclone.14 the larger the cyclone the larger the impact of the beta effect is likely to be.15 starting in 1990 three versions of the bam were run operationally the bam shallow bams average winds in an 850 hpa to 700 hpa layer the bam medium bamm which uses average winds in an 850 hpa to 400 hpa layer and the bam deep bamd which is the same as the pre-1990 bam.4 for a weak hurricane without well-developed central thunderstorm activity bams works well because weak storms tend to be steered by low-level winds.1 as the storm grows stronger and associated thunderstorm activity near its center gets deeper bamm and bamd become more accurate as these types of storms are steered more by the winds in the upper-level if the forecast from the three versions is similar then the forecaster can conclude that there is minimal uncertainty but if the versions vary by a great deal then the forecaster has less confidence in the track predicted due to the greater uncertainty.16 large differences between model predictions can also indicate wind shear in the atmosphere which could affect the intensity forecast as well.1 tested in 1989 and 1990 the vic ooyama barotropic vicbar model used a cubic-b spline representation of variables for the objective analysis of observations and solutions to the shallow-water prediction equations on nested domains with the boundary conditions defined as the global forecast model.17 it was implemented operationally as the limited area sine transform barotropic lbar model in 1992 using the gfs for boundary conditions.2 by 1990 australia had developed its own storm surge model which was able to be run in a few minutes on a personal computer.18 the japan meteorological agency jma developed its own typhoon model tym in 199419 and in 1998 the agency began using its own dynamic storm surge model.20 timelinessedit some models do not produce output quickly enough to be used for the forecast cycle immediately after the model starts running including hwrf gfdl and fsse most of the above track models except cliper require data from global weather models such as the gfs which produce output about four hours after the synoptic times of 0000 0600 1200 and 1800 universal coordinated time utc for half of their forecasts the nhc issues forecasts only three hours after that time so some early models  nhc90 bam and lbar  are run using a 12-hour-old forecast for the current time late models such as the gfs and gfdl finish after the advisory has already been issued these models are interpolated to the current storm position for use in the following forecast cycle  for example gfdi the interpolated version of the gfdl model.124 consensus methodsedit using a consensus of forecast models reduces forecast error.25 trackwise the guna model is a consensus of the interpolated versions of the gfdl ukmet with quality control applied to the cyclone tracker united states navy nogaps and gfs models the version of the guna corrected for model biases is known as the cgun the tcon consensus is the guna consensus plus the hurricane wrf model the version of the tcon corrected for model biases is known as the tccn a lagged average of the last two runs of the members within the tcon plus the ecmwf model is known as the tvcn consensus the version of the tvcn corrected for model biases is the tvcc consensus.1 in early 2013 the navgem replaced the nogaps as the navy's primary operational global forecast model for the 2013 season and until model verification can occur it is not being utilized in the development of any consensus forecasts for intensity a combination of the lgem interpolated gfdl interpolated hwrf and dships models is known as the icon consensus the lagged average of the last two runs of models within the icon consensus is called the ivcn consensus.1 across the northwest pacific and southern hemisphere a ten-member stips consensus is formed from the output of the nogaps gfs the japanese gsm the coupled ocean/atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps the ukmet the japanese tym the gfdl with nogaps boundary conditions the air force weather agency afwa model the australian tropical cyclone local area prediction system and the weber barotropic model.7 ensemble methodsedit no model is ever perfectly accurate because it is impossible to learn exactly everything about the atmosphere in a timely enough manner and atmospheric measurements that are taken are not completely accurate.26 the use of the ensemble method of forecasting whether it be a multi-model ensemble or numerous ensemble members based on the global model helps define the uncertainty and further limit errors.2728 sunspot theoryedit a 2010 report correlates low sunspot activity with high hurricane activity analyzing historical data there was a 25 chance of at least one hurricane striking the continental united states during a peak sunspot year a 64 chance during a low sunspot year in june 2010 the hurricanes predictors in the us were not using this information.32 hurricane forecast model accuracyedit the accuracy of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm for some storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are relatively straightforward and the models are not only accurate but they produce similar forecasts while for other storms the factors affecting the hurricane track are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts.33 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit  navigation menu personal tools namespaces

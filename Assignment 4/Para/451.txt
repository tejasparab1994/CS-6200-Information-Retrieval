foundingedit in 1854 territorial governor isaac stevens recommended the establishment of a university in washington prominent seattle-area residents including methodist preacher daniel bagley saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige they convinced early founder of seattle and member of the territorial legislature arthur a denny on the importance of the school two universities were initially chartered but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in lewis county provided that locally donated land was available when no site emerged denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider seattle as a location in 1858 on november 4 1861 washington opened as the territorial university of washington the legislature passed articles incorporating the university and establishing its board of regents in 1862 the school initially struggled closing three times in 1863 for low enrollment and again in 1867 and 1876 due to funds shortage washington successfully awarded its first graduate clara antoinette mccarty wilt in 1876 with a bachelor's degree in science 19th century relocationedit by the time washington state entered the union in 1889 both seattle and the university had grown substantially washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students and the campus's relative isolation in downtown seattle faced encroaching development a special legislative committee headed by uw graduate edmond meany was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty the committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of downtown seattle called union bay and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction in 1895 the university relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built denny hall the university regents tried and failed to sell the old campus eventually settling with leasing the area this would later become one of the university's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day seattle generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the metropolitan tract the original territorial university building was torn down in 1908 and its former site now houses the fairmont olympic hotel 20th century expansionedit organizers of the 1909 alaska-yukon-pacific exposition eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their world's fair they came to an agreement with washington's board of regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition in exchange washington would take advantage of the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion this arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several buildings prepared in part by john charles olmsted the plan was later incorporated into the overall campus master plan permanently affecting the campus layout both world wars brought the military to campus with certain facilities temporarily loaned to the federal government regardless subsequent post-war periods were times of dramatic growth for the university.9 the period between the wars saw a significant expansion on the upper campus construction of the liberal arts quadrangle known to students as the quad began in 1916 and continued to 1939 the university's architectural centerpiece suzzallo library was built in 1926

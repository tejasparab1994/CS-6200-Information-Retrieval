potomac river   contents  geographyedit the river forms part of the borders between maryland and washington d.c. on the left descending bank and west virginia and virginia on the river's right descending bank the majority of the lower potomac river is part of the state of maryland exceptions include a small tidal portion within the district of columbia and the border with virginia being delineated from point to point thus various bays and shoreline indentations lie in virginia except for a small portion of its headwaters in west virginia the north branch potomac river is considered part of maryland to the low water mark on the opposite bank the south branch potomac river lies completely within the state of west virginia except for its headwaters which lie in virginia the river has two sources the source of the north branch is at the fairfax stone located at the junction of grant tucker and preston counties in west virginia the source of the south branch is located near hightown in northern highland county virginia the river's two branches converge just east of green spring in hampshire county west virginia to form the potomac historyedit potomac is a european spelling of patowmeck the algonquian name of a native american village perhaps meaning something brought.3 native americans had different names for different parts of the river calling the river above great falls cohongarooton meaning honking geese45 and patawomke below the fall meaning river of swans.6 the spelling of the name has taken many forms over the years from patawomeke as on captain john smith's map to patawomeck patowmack and numerous other spellings in the 18th century and now potomac.5 the river's name was officially decided upon as potomac by the board on geographic names in 1931.7 the river itself is at least two million years old likely extending back ten to twenty million years before present when the atlantic ocean lowered and exposed coastal sediments along the fall line this included the area at great falls which eroded into its present form during recent glaciation periods.8 the potomac river brings together a variety of cultures throughout the watershed from the coal miners of upstream west virginia to the urban residents of the nation's capital and along the lower potomac the watermen of virginia's northern neck the patowmack canal was intended by george washington to connect the tidewater region near georgetown with cumberland maryland started in 1785 on the virginia side of the river it was not completed until 1802 financial troubles led to the closure of the canal in 1830 the chesapeake and ohio canal operated along the banks of the potomac in maryland from 1831 to 1924 and also connected cumberland to washington d.c.10 this allowed freight to be transported around the rapids known as the great falls of the potomac river as well as many other smaller rapids washington d.c began using the potomac as its principal source of drinking water with the opening of the washington aqueduct in 1864 using a water intake constructed at great falls.11 in march 1996 an agreement was signed which made the potomac a sister river of the ara river one of the principal rivers of tokyo.12 president bill clinton designated the potomac as one of the american heritage rivers in 1998.13 water supply and water qualityedit as a result of damaging floods in 1936 and 1937 the army corps of engineers proposed a series of dams that were intended to regulate the river and to provide a more reliable water supply one dam was to be built at little falls just north of washington backing its pool up to great falls just above great falls a much larger dam was proposed whose reservoir would extend to harpers ferry.14 several other dams were proposed for the potomac and its tributaries when detailed studies were issued by the corps in the 1950s they met sustained opposition led by u.s supreme court justice william o douglas resulting in the plans abandonment.15 the only dam project that did get built was jennings randolph lake on the north branch the corps built a supplementary water intake for the washington aqueduct at little falls in 1959.16 in 1940 congress passed a law authorizing creation of an interstate compact to coordinate water quality management among states in the potomac basin maryland west virginia pennsylvania virginia and the district of columbia agreed to establish the interstate commission on the potomac river basin the compact was amended in 1970 to include coordination of water supply issues and land use issues related to water quality.17 beginning in the 19th century with increasing mining and agriculture upstream and urban sewage and runoff downstream the water quality of the potomac river deteriorated this created conditions of severe eutrophication it is said that president abraham lincoln used to escape to the highlands on summer nights to escape the river's stench in the 1960s with dense green algal blooms covering the river's surface president lyndon johnson declared the river a national disgrace and set in motion a long-term effort to reduce pollution from sewage and restore the beauty and ecology of this historic river one of significant pollution control projects at the time was the expansion of the blue plains advanced wastewater treatment plant which serves washington and several surrounding communities.18 enactment of the 1972 clean water act led to construction or expansion of additional sewage treatment plants in the potomac watershed controls on phosphorus one of the principal contributors to eutrophication were implemented in the 1980s through sewage plant upgrades and restrictions on phosphorus in detergents.17 by the end of the 20th century there was notable success as massive algal blooms vanished and recreational fishing and boating rebounded still the aquatic habitat of the potomac river and its tributaries remain vulnerable to eutrophication heavy metals pesticides and other toxic chemicals over-fishing alien species and pathogens associated with fecal coliform bacteria and shellfish diseases in 2005 two federal agencies the us geological survey and the fish and wildlife service began to identify fish in the potomac and tributaries that exhibited intersex characteristics as a result of endocrine disruption caused by some form of pollution.19 on november 13 2007 the potomac conservancy an environmental group issued the river a grade of d-plus citing high levels of pollution and the reports of intersex fish.20 since then the river has improved with a reduction in nutrient runoff return of fish populations and land protection along the river as a result the same group issued a grade of b-minus in 2016 21 legal issuesedit for 400 years maryland and virginia have disputed control of the potomac and its north branch since both states original colonial charters grant the entire river rather than half of it as is normally the case with boundary rivers in its first state constitution adopted in 1776 virginia ceded its claim to the entire river but reserved free use of it an act disputed by maryland both states acceded to the compact of 1785 and the 1877 black-jenkins award which grants maryland the river bank-to-bank from the low water mark on the virginia side while permitting virginia full riparian rights short of obstructing navigation from 1957 to 1996 the maryland department of the environment mde routinely issued permits applied for by virginia entities concerning use of the potomac however in 1996 the mde denied a permit submitted by the fairfax county water authority to build a water intake 725 feet 220 m offshore citing potential harm to maryland's interests by an increase in virginia sprawl caused by the project after years of failed appeals within the maryland government's appeal processes in 2000 virginia took the case to the supreme court of the united states which exercises original jurisdiction in cases between two states maryland claimed virginia lost its riparian rights by acquiescing to mde's permit process for 63 years mde began its permit process in 1933 a special master appointed by the supreme court to investigate recommended the case be settled in favor of virginia citing the language in the 1785 compact and the 1877 award on december 9 2003 the court agreed in a 7-2 decision.22 the original charters are silent as to which branch from the upper potomac serves as the boundary but this was settled by the 1785 compact when west virginia seceded from virginia in 1863 the question of west virginia's succession in title to the lands between the branches of the river was raised as well as title to the river itself claims by maryland to west virginia land north of the south branch all of mineral and grant counties and parts of hampshire hardy tucker and pendleton counties and by west virginia to the potomac's high-water mark were rejected by the supreme court in two separate decisions in 1910.2324 north branch potomac riveredit the source of the north branch potomac river is at the fairfax stone located at the junction of grant tucker and preston counties in west virginia the following are major tributaries of the north branch potomac river listed in order from the source to its mouth numerous other tributary creeks exist south branch potomac riveredit south branch nomenclatureedit the native americans of the region and thus the earliest white settlers referred to the south branch potomac river as the wappatomaka variants throughout the river's history included wappatomica river wapacomo river wapocomo river wappacoma river wappatomaka river south branch of potowmac river and south fork potomac river.26 places settled in the south branch valley bearing variants of wappatomaka include wappocomo farm built in 1774 and the unincorporated hamlet of wappocomo sometimes spelled wapocomo at hanging rocks both north of romney on west

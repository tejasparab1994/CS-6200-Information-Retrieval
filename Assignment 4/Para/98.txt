angular momentum in physics angular momentum rarely moment of momentum or rotational momentum is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum it is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity  the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque angular momentum is additive the total angular momentum of a system is the pseudovector sum of the angular momenta for continua or fields one uses integration the total angular momentum of anything can always be split into the sum of two main components orbital angular momentum about an axis outside the object plus spin angular momentum through the centre of mass of the object torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum analogous to force the conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted the high rotational rates of neutron stars the falling cat problem and precession of tops and gyros applications include the gyrocompass control moment gyroscope inertial guidance systems reaction wheels flying discs or frisbees and earth's rotation to name a few in general conservation does limit the possible motion of a system but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is in quantum mechanics angular momentum is an operator with quantized eigenvalues angular momentum is subject to the heisenberg uncertainty principle meaning that only one component can be measured with definite precision the other two cannot also the spin of elementary particles does not correspond to literal spinning motion.1  contents  angular momentum in classical mechanicsedit definitionedit scalar  angular momentum in two dimensionsedit angular momentum is a vector quantity more precisely a pseudovector that represents the product of a body's rotational inertia and rotational velocity about a particular axis in the simple case of revolution of a particle in a circle about a center of rotation the particle remaining always in the same plane and having always the same distance from the center it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum and treat it as a scalar.2 angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of linear momentum thus where linear momentumpdisplaystyle p is proportional to massmdisplaystyle m and linear speedvdisplaystyle v unlike mass which depends only on amount of matter moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter unlike linear speed which occurs in a straight line angular speed occurs about a center of rotation therefore strictly speakingldisplaystyle l should be referred to as the angular momentum relative to that center.4 this simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is perpendicular to the radius vector is considered in that case scalar  angular momentum from lagrangian mechanicsedit and the potential energy is then the lagrangian is vector  angular momentum in three dimensionsedit to completely define angular momentum in three dimensions it is required to know the angle swept out in unit time the direction of the axis of rotation and the sense right or left-handed of the rotation as well as the mass involved.6 by retaining this vector nature of angular momentum the general nature of the equations is also retained and can describe any sort of three-dimensional motion about the center of rotation  circular linear or otherwise in vector notation the angular momentum of a particle in motion about the origin of coordinates is defined as this can be expandedlr2mrvr2displaystyle mathbf l

perpendicular to bothrdisplaystyle mathbf r  andpdisplaystyle mathbf p  it is directed along the axis of rotation as indicated by the right-hand rule  so that the rotation is seen as counter-clockwise from the head of the vector conversely theldisplaystyle mathbf l  vector defines the plane in whichrdisplaystyle mathbf r  andpdisplaystyle mathbf p  lie the two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction andlrmvudisplaystyle mathbf l =rmvmathbf hat u  for circular motion where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radiusrdisplaystyle r discussionedit angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of linear momentum like linear momentum it involves elements of mass and displacement unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of position and shape many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space be it in actual rotation about it or simply moving past it where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point  can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it energy the ability to do work can be stored in matter by setting it in motion  a combination of its inertia and its displacement inertia is measured by its mass and displacement by its velocity their product is the matter's momentum.7 referring this momentum to a central point introduces a complication the momentum is not applied to the point directly for instance a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is in effect at the end of a lever of the same length as the wheel's radius its momentum turning the lever about the center point this imaginary lever is known as the moment arm it has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length an effect known as a moment hence the particle's momentum referred to a particular point because rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum it necessarily includes all of the complications of moment of inertia which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the squares of their distances from the center of rotation.9 therefore the total moment of inertia and the angular momentum is a complex function of the configuration of the matter about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bits for a rigid body for instance a wheel or an asteroid the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the rotation axis versus the matter of the body it may or may not pass through the center of mass or it may lie completely outside of the body for the same body angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place.10 it reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass.11 for a collection of objects revolving about a center for instance all of the bodies of the solar system the orientations may be somewhat organized as is the solar system with most of the bodies axes lying close to the system's axis their orientations may also be completely random in brief the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation the longer the moment arm the greater the moment of inertia and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given angular velocity in many cases the moment of inertia and hence the angular momentum can be simplified by12 similarly for a point massmdisplaystyle m the moment of inertia is defined as and for any collection of particlesmidisplaystyle m_i as the sum the plane perpendicular to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass15 is sometimes called the invariable plane because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system free from outside influences are considered.16 one such plane is the invariable plane of the solar system angular momentum and torqueedit newton's second law of motion can be expressed mathematically or force  mass  acceleration the rotational equivalent is or angular momentum  moment of inertia  angular velocity and its time derivative is therefore the time rate of change of angular momentum about a particular center of rotation is equivalent to applied torque about that center.4 if angular momentum is constantdldt0displaystyle frac dmathbf l dt=0 and no torque is applied conservation of angular momentumedit a rotational analog of newton's third law of motion might be written in a closed system no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque.18 hence angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant is conserved.19 similarly a rotational analog of newton's second law of motion might be a change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and occurs about the same axis as that torque.18 since a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum then if torque is zero angular momentum is constant as above a system with constant angular momentum is a closed system therefore requiring the system to be closed is equivalent to requiring that no external influence in the form of a torque acts upon it.20 a rotational analog of newton's first law of motion might be written a body continues in a state of rest or of uniform rotation unless acted by an external torque.18 thus with no external influence to act upon it the original angular momentum of the system is conserved.21 the conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation by bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity if the angular momentum remains constant is conserved then the angular velocity rotational speed of the skater must increase the same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars like white dwarfs neutron stars and black holes when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars decrease in the size of an object n times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of n2 conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint for example a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis and another about its precession axis also in any planetary system the planets stars comets and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved noether's theorem states that every conservation law is associated with a symmetry invariant of the underlying physics the symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is rotational invariance the fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.24 angular momentum in orbital mechanicsedit in astrodynamics and celestial mechanics a massless or per unit mass angular momentum is defined25 called specific angular momentum note thatlmhdisplaystyle mathbf l =mmathbf h . mass is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations because motion is defined by gravity the primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it it is in effect stationary all bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way regardless of mass and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions solid bodiesedit and integrating this differential over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum in the derivation which follows integrals similar to this can replace the sums for the case of continuous mass collection of particlesedit center of massedit for a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin it is informative to develop the equation of angular momentum by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin given the total mass of the particles is simply their sum the position vector of the center of mass is defined by26 by inspection the total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the angular momentum of each particle lirimividisplaystyle mathbf l =sum _imathbf r _itimes m_imathbf v _i 1 expandingridisplaystyle

relative to the origin similar to single particle below it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass m at the center of mass moving with velocity v the second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass similar to fixed center of mass below the result is general  the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass the particles need not be individual masses but can be elements of a continuous distribution such as a solid body rearranging equation 2 by vector identities multiplying both terms by one and grouping appropriately simplificationsedit in the case of a single particle moving about the arbitrary origin for the case of the center of mass fixed in space with respect to the origin angular momentum modern definitionedit in modern 20th century theoretical physics angular momentum not including any intrinsic angular momentum  see below is described using a different formalism instead of a classical pseudovector in this formalism angular momentum is the 2-form noether charge associated with rotational invariance as a result angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.citation needed in classical mechanics the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element in which the exterior product  replaces the cross product  these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent this has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element defined from the x and p vectors and the expression is true in any number of dimensions two or higher in cartesian coordinates or more compactly in index notation in relativistic mechanics the relativistic angular momentum of a particle is expressed as an antisymmetric tensor of second order in the language of four-vectors namely the four position x and the four momentum p and absorbs the above l together with the motion of the centre of mass of the particle in each of the above cases for a system of particles the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta and the centre of mass is for the system angular momentum in quantum mechanicsedit angular momentum in quantum mechanics differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in classical mechanics in relativistic quantum mechanics it differs even more in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operator spin orbital and total angular momentumedit the classical definition of angular momentum aslrpdisplaystyle mathbf l =mathbf r times mathbf p  can be carried over to quantum mechanics by reinterpreting r as the quantum position operator and p as the quantum momentum operator l is then an operator specifically called the orbital angular momentum operator the components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the lie algebra so3 of the rotation group so3 indeed these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum hilbert space.30 see also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations. quantizationedit there are additional restrictions as well see angular momentum operator for details. uncertaintyedit in the definitionlrpdisplaystyle mathbf l =mathbf r times mathbf p  six operators are involved the position operatorsrxdisplaystyle r_xrydisplaystyle r_yrzdisplaystyle r_z and the momentum operatorspxdisplaystyle p_xpydisplaystyle p_ypzdisplaystyle p_z however the heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision therefore there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum it turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's magnitude and its component along one axis the uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an angular momentum operator do not commute for examplelxlylylxdisplaystyle l_xl_yneq l_yl_x for the precise commutation relations see angular momentum operator. total angular momentum as generator of rotationsedit as mentioned above orbital angular momentum l is defined as in classical mechanicslrpdisplaystyle mathbf l =mathbf r times mathbf p  but total angular momentum j is defined in a different more basic way j is defined as the generator of rotations.32 more specifically j is defined so that the operator the relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between lie algebras and lie groups in mathematics the close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in noether's theorem that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant angular momentum in electrodynamicsedit when describing the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field the canonical momentum p derived from the lagrangian for this system is not gauge invariant as a consequence the canonical angular momentum l  r  p is not gauge invariant either instead the momentum that is physical the so-called kinetic momentum used throughout this article is in si units where e is the electric charge of the particle and a the magnetic vector potential of the electromagnetic field the gauge-invariant angular momentum that is kinetic angular momentum is given by the interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on canonical commutation relations angular momentum in opticsedit in classical maxwell electrodynamics the poynting vector is a linear momentum density of electromagnetic field.33 the angular momentum density vectorlrtdisplaystyle mathbf l mathbf r t is given by a vector product as in classical mechanics:34 the above identities are valid locally  i.e in each space pointrdisplaystyle mathbf r  in a given momenttdisplaystyle t historyedit newton in the principia hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the first law of motion he did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the principia however his geometric proof of the law of areas is an outstanding example of newton's genius and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a central force the law of areasedit newton's derivationedit as a planet orbits the sun the line between the sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time this had been known since kepler expounded his second law of planetary motion newton derived a unique geometric proof and went on to show that the attractive force of the sun's gravity was the cause of all of kepler's laws during the first interval of time an object is in motion from point a to point b undisturbed it would continue to point c during the second interval when the object arrives at b it receives an impulse directed toward point s the impulse gives it a small added velocity toward s such that if this were its only velocity it would move from b to v during the second interval by the rules of velocity composition these two velocities add and point c is found by construction of parallelogram bccv thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point c at the end of the second interval because the triangles sbc and sbc have the same base sb and the same height bc or vc they have the same area by symmetry triangle sbc also has the same area as triangle sab therefore the object has swept out equal areas sab and sbc in equal times at point c the object receives another impulse toward s again deflecting its path during the third interval from d to d thus it continues to e and beyond the triangles sab sbc sbc scd scd sde sde all having the same area allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller the path abcde approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve note that because this derivation is geometric and no specific force is applied it proves a more general law than kepler's second law of planetary motion it shows that the law of areas applies to any central force attractive or repulsive continuous or non-continuous or zero conservation of angular momentum in the law of areasedit in the case of triangle sbc area is equal to 1/2sbvc wherever c is eventually located due to the impulse applied at b the product sbvc and therefore rmv remain constant similarly so for each of the triangles after newtonedit leonhard euler daniel bernoulli and patrick d'arcy all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of areal velocity a result of their analysis of kepler's second law of planetary motion it is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.37 in 1736 euler like newton touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his mechanica without further developing them.38 bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a moment of rotational motion possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.39 in 1799 pierre-simon laplace first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation  his invariable plane louis poinsot in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation and elaborated on the conservation of moments william j m rankine's 1858 manual of applied mechanics defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time in an 1872 edition of the same book rankine stated that the term angular momentum was introduced by mr hayward40 probably referring to r.b hayward's article on a direct method of estimating velocities accelerations and all similar quantities with respect to axes moveable in any manner in space with applications41 which was introduced in 1856 and published in 1864 rankine was mistaken as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries.42 however hayward's article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the english-speaking world before this angular momentum was typically referred to as momentum of rotation in english.43 see alsoedit footnotesedit referencesedit external

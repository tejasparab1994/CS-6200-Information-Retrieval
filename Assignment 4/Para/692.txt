canada various indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now canada for thousands of years prior to european colonization beginning in the 16th century the british and french established colonies the first being the colony of canada established by france in 1535 as a consequence of various armed conflicts british north america gained and lost territory until by the late 18th century it controlled most of what comprises canada today on july 1 1867 the colonies of canada new brunswick and nova scotia were federated to form the semi-autonomous federal dominion named canada this began an accretion of provinces and territories to the dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming contemporary canada canada achieved independence gradually beginning with responsible government in the 1830s and culminating with the patriation of the constitution in 1982 in 1931 canada achieved near-total independence from the united kingdom with the statute of westminster 1931 except for the power to amend its constitution canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with queen elizabeth ii being the head of state the country is officially bilingual at the federal level it is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks canada's long and complex relationship with the united states has had a significant impact on its economy and culture canada is a developed country and has the fifteenth-highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the tenth-highest ranking in the human development index it ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency civil liberties quality of life economic freedom and education canada is a realm within the commonwealth of nations a member of the francophonie and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the united nations the north atlantic treaty organization the g7 formerly g8 the group of ten the g20 the north american free trade agreement and the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum  contents  etymology while a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of canada the name is now accepted as coming from the st lawrence iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement.12 in 1535 indigenous inhabitants of the present-day quebec city region used the word to direct french explorer jacques cartier to the village of stadacona.13 cartier later used the word canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to donnacona the chief at stadacona;13 by 1545 european books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the saint lawrence river as canada.13 from the 16th to the early 18th century canada referred to the part of new france that lay along the saint lawrence river.14 in 1791 the area became two british colonies called upper canada and lower canada collectively named the canadas until their union as the british province of canada in 1841.15 upon confederation in 1867 canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the london conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country's title.16 the transition away from the use of dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the canada act which refers only to canada later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from dominion day to canada day.17 the term dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces though after the second world war the term federal had replaced dominion.18 history indigenous peoples the first inhabitants of north america are generally hypothesized to have migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge21 and arrived at least 15000 years ago though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.22232425 the paleo-indian archeological sites at old crow flats and bluefish caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in canada.26 the characteristics of canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks.2728 some of these cultures had collapsed by the time european explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.29 the indigenous population at the time of the first european settlements is estimated to have been between 20000030 and two million31 with a figure of 500000 accepted by canada's royal commission on aboriginal peoples.32 as a consequence of european colonization the population of canada's indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent and several first nations such as the beothuk disappeared.33 the decline is attributed to several causes including the transfer of european diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity3034 conflicts over the fur trade conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations self-sufficiency.3536 european colonization in 1583 sir humphrey gilbert by the royal prerogative of queen elizabeth i founded st john's newfoundland as the first north american english colony.49 french explorer samuel de champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent european settlements at port royal in 1605 and quebec city in 1608.50 among the colonists of new france canadiens extensively settled the saint lawrence river valley and acadians settled the present-day maritimes while fur traders and catholic missionaries explored the great lakes hudson bay and the mississippi watershed to louisiana.51 the beaver wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the north american fur trade.52 the english established additional settlements in newfoundland beginning in 161053 and the thirteen colonies to the south were founded soon after.46 a series of four wars erupted in colonial north america between 1689 and 1763 the later wars of the period constituted the north american theatre of the seven years war.54 mainland nova scotia came under british rule with the 1713 treaty of utrecht and canada and most of new france came under british rule in 1763 after the seven years war.55 the royal proclamation of 1763 established first nation treaty rights created the province of quebec out of new france and annexed cape breton island to nova scotia.17 st john's island now prince edward island became a separate colony in 1769.56 to avert conflict in quebec the british parliament passed the quebec act of 1774 expanding quebec's territory to the great lakes and ohio valley more importantly the quebec act afforded quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time that the thirteen colonies were increasingly agitating against british rule.57 it re-established the french language catholic faith and french civil law there staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the thirteen colonies the proclamation and the quebec act in turn angered many residents of the thirteen colonies further fuelling anti-british sentiment in the years prior to the american revolution.17 after the successful american war of independence the 1783 treaty of paris recognized the independence of the newly formed united state and set the terms of peace ceding british north american territories south of the great lakes to the new country.58 the american war of independence also caused a large out-migration of loyalists the settlers who had fought against american independence many moved to canada particularly atlantic canada where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories new brunswick was in turn split from nova scotia as part of a reorganization of loyalist settlements in the maritimes.59 to accommodate the influx of english-speaking loyalists in central canada the constitutional act of 1791 divided the province of canada into french-speaking lower canada later quebec and english-speaking upper canada later ontario granting each its own elected legislative assembly.60 the desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive rebellions of 1837.63 the durham report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of french canadians into english culture.17 the act of union merged the canadas into a united province of canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of british north america by 1849.64 the signing of the oregon treaty by britain and the united states in 1846 ended the oregon boundary dispute extending the border westward along the 49th parallel this paved the way for british colonies on vancouver island 1849 and in british columbia 1858.65 in 1867 the same year as canadian confederation britain declined to purchase for canada the alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by russia with the united states purchasing alaska instead clearly demarcated borders for canada although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarkation of the alaska-yukon and alaska-bc border for years to come.66 confederation and expansion to open the west to european immigration parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways including the canadian pacific railway opening the prairies to settlement with the dominion lands act and establishing the north-west mounted police to assert its authority over this territory.7172 in 1898 during the klondike gold rush in the northwest territories parliament created the yukon territory alberta and saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.70 early 20th century because britain still maintained control of canada's foreign affairs under the confederation act its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought canada into world war i.73 volunteers sent to the western front later became part of the canadian corps which played a substantial role in the battle of vimy ridge and other major engagements of the war.74 out of approximately 625000 canadians who served in world war i some 60000 were killed and another 172000 were wounded.75 the conscription crisis of 1917 erupted when the unionist cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from french-speaking quebecers.76 the military service act brought in compulsory military service though it coupled with disputes over french language schools outside quebec deeply alienated francophone canadians and temporarily split the liberal party.76 in 1919 canada joined the league of nations independently of britain74 and the 1931 statute of westminster affirmed canada's independence.4 the great depression in canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn leading to hardship across the country.77 in response to the downturn the co-operative commonwealth federation ccf in saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state as pioneered by tommy douglas in the 1940s and 1950s.78 on the advice of prime minister william lyon mackenzie king war with germany was declared effective september 10 1939 by king george vi seven days after the united kingdom the delay underscored canada's independence.74 the first canadian army units arrived in britain in december 1939 in all over a million canadians served in the armed forces during world war ii and approximately 42000 were killed and another 55000 were wounded.79 canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war including the failed 1942 dieppe raid the allied invasion of italy the normandy landings the battle of normandy and the battle of the scheldt in 1944.74 canada provided asylum for the dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from nazi germany.80 the canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for canada britain china and the soviet union.74 despite another conscription crisis in quebec in 1944 canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.81 contemporary era the financial crisis of the great depression had led the dominion of newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a british governor.82 after two bitter referendums newfoundlanders voted to join canada in 1949 as a province.83 canada's post-war economic growth combined with the policies of successive liberal governments led to the emergence of a new canadian identity marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in 196584 the implementation of official bilingualism english and french in 196985 and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971.86 socially democratic programs were also instituted such as medicare the canada pension plan and canada student loans though provincial governments particularly quebec and alberta opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.87 finally another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the canada act the patriation of canada's constitution from the united kingdom concurrent with the creation of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms.888990 canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country although the queen retained her role as monarch of canada.9192 in 1999 nunavut became canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.93 canada sent troops to afghanistan in 2001 but declined to join the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in 2003.105 in 2011 canadian forces participated in the nato-led intervention into the libyan civil war106 and also became involved in battling the islamic state insurgency in iraq in the mid-2010s.107 geography and climate canada occupies much of the continent of north america sharing land borders with the contiguous united states to the south and the us state of alaska to the northwest canada stretches from the atlantic ocean in the east to the pacific ocean in the west to the north lies the arctic ocean.108 greenland is to the northeast by total area including its waters canada is the second-largest country in the world after russia by land area alone however canada ranks fourth the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.109 government and politics canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy the monarchy of canada being the foundation of the executive legislative and judicial branches.122123124 the sovereign is queen elizabeth ii who is also monarch of 15 other commonwealth countries and each of canada's 10 provinces as such the queen's representative the governor general of canada at present julie payette carries out most of the federal royal duties in canada.125126 the direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited.124127128 in practice their use of the executive powers is directed by the cabinet a committee of ministers of the crown responsible to the elected house of commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister of canada at present justin trudeau129 the head of government the governor general or monarch may though in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice.127 to ensure the stability of government the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the house of commons.130 the prime minister's office pmo is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the crown besides the aforementioned the governor general lieutenant governors senators federal court judges and heads of crown corporations and government agencies.127 the leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of her majesty's loyal opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.131 canada's federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the house of commons.128 canada's three territories also have legislatures but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.136 the territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.137 the bank of canada is the central bank of the country in addition the minister of finance and minister of industry utilize the statistics canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development.138 the bank of canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of canadian bank notes.139 the bank does not issue canadian coins they are issued by the royal canadian mint.140 law canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of parliament that violate the constitution the supreme court of canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since 2000 by the chief justice beverley mclachlin the first female chief justice.148 its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice all judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with nongovernmental legal bodies the federal cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.149 common law prevails everywhere except in quebec where civil law predominates criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout canada.150 law enforcement including criminal courts is officially a provincial responsibility conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.151 however in most rural areas and some urban areas policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal royal canadian mounted police.152 foreign relations and military canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions.153 canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations and through the work of numerous federal institutions.154 canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.155 the strategy of the canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the millennium development goals while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.156 canada was a founding member of the united nations and has membership in the world trade organization the g20 and the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd.153 canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.157 canada acceded to the international covenant on civil and political rights in 1976.158 canada joined the organization of american states oas in 1990 and hosted the oas general assembly in 2000 and the 3rd summit of the americas in 2001.159 canada seeks to expand its ties to pacific rim economies through membership in the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum apec.160 canada and the united states share the world's longest undefended border co-operate on military campaigns and exercises and are each other's largest trading partner.161162 canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy most notably maintaining full relations with cuba since and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of iraq.163 canada also maintains historic ties to the united kingdom and france and to other former british and french colonies through canada's membership in the commonwealth of nations and the francophonie.164 canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the netherlands owing in part to its contribution to the dutch liberation during world war ii.80 canada's strong attachment to the british empire and commonwealth led to major participation in british military efforts in the second boer war world war i and world war ii.165 since then canada has been an advocate for multilateralism making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.166167 during the cold war canada was a major contributor to un forces in the korean war and founded the north american aerospace defense command norad in co-operation with the united states to defend against potential aerial attacks from the soviet union.168 during the suez crisis of 1956 future prime minister lester b pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the united nations peacekeeping force for which he was awarded the 1957 nobel peace prize.169 as this was the first un peacekeeping mission pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.170 canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions including every un peacekeeping effort until 198974 and has since maintained forces in international missions in rwanda the former yugoslavia and elsewhere canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries notably in the 1993 somalia affair.171 in 2001 canada deployed troops to afghanistan as part of the us stabilization force and the un-authorized nato-led international security assistance force.172 in february 2007 canada italy the united kingdom norway and russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing nations and called on other countries to join them.173 in august 2007 canada's territorial claims in the arctic were challenged after a russian underwater expedition to the north pole canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.174 provinces and territories canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three territories in turn these may be grouped into four main regions western canada central canada atlantic canada and northern canada eastern canada refers to central canada and atlantic canada together provinces have more autonomy than territories having responsibility for social programs such as health care education and welfare.179 together the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government an almost unique structure among federations in the world using its spending powers the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as the canada health act the provinces can opt out of these but rarely do so in practice equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.180 economy since the early 20th century the growth of canada's manufacturing mining and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized industrial one.191 like many other developed countries the canadian economy is dominated by the service industry which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.192 however canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.193 canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.194 atlantic canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas and alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources the vastness of the athabasca oil sands and other assets results in canada having a 13 share of global oil reserves comprising the world's third-largest share after venezuela and saudi arabia.195 canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products the canadian prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat canola and other grains.196 canada's ministry of natural resources provides statistics regarding its major exports the country is a leading exporter of zinc uranium gold nickel aluminum steel iron ore coking coal and lead.197 many towns in northern canada where agriculture is difficult are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern ontario and quebec with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.198 science and technology the canadian space agency operates a highly active space program conducting deep-space planetary and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.209 canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the soviet union and the united states with the 1962 alouette 1 launch.210 canada is a participant in the international space station iss and is a pioneer in space robotics having constructed the canadarm canadarm2 and dextre robotic manipulators for the iss and nasa's space shuttle.211 since the 1960s canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite including radarsat-1 and 2 isis and most.212 canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets the black brant over 1000 black brants have been launched since the rocket's introduction in 1961.213 in 1984 marc garneau became canada's first male astronaut followed by canada's second and first female astronaut roberta bondar in 1992.214 demographics canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world221 driven mainly by economic policy and to a lesser extent family reunification.222223 the canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration.222224225 in 2014 a total of 260400 immigrants were admitted to canada.226 the canadian government anticipated between 280000 and 305000 new permanent residents in the following years.227 a similar number of immigrants as in recent years.228 new immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as toronto montreal and vancouver.229 canada also accepts large numbers of refugees230 accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.231 in common with many other developed countries canada is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population with more retirees and fewer people of working age

is a constitutionally protected right allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.258 the practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state.259 with christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to canadian culture and daily life260 canada has become a post-christian secular state.261262263264 the majority of canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives265 but still believe in god.266 according to the 2011 census 67.3 of canadians identify as

there are substantial francophone populations in new brunswick alberta and manitoba ontario has the largest french-speaking population outside quebec.278 new brunswick the only officially bilingual province has a french-speaking acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.279 there are also clusters of acadians in southwestern nova scotia on cape breton island and through central and western prince edward island.280 other provinces have no official languages as such but french is used as a language of instruction in courts and for other government services in addition to english manitoba ontario and quebec allow for both english and french to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages in ontario french has some legal status but is not fully co-official.281 there are 11 indigenous language groups composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.282 of these only the cree inuktitut and ojibway languages have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term.283 several indigenous languages have official status in the northwest territories.284 inuktitut is the majority language in nunavut and is one of three official languages in the territory.285 additionally canada is home to many sign languages some of which are indigenous.286 american sign language asl is spoken across the country due to the prevalence of asl in primary and secondary schools.287 due to its historical relation to the francophone culture quebec sign language lsq is spoken primarily in quebec although there are sizeable francophone communities in new brunswick ontario and manitoba.288 culture canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism which is based on selective immigration social integration and suppression of far-right politics has wide public support.297 government policies such as publicly funded health care higher taxation to redistribute wealth the outlawing of capital punishment strong efforts to eliminate poverty strict gun control and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of canada's political and cultural values.298299 canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions peacekeeping the national park system and the canadian charter of rights and freedoms.293300 historically canada has

canadians with african caribbean and asian nationalities have added to the canadian identity and its culture.302 canadian humour is an integral part of the canadian identity and is reflected in its folklore literature music art and media the primary characteristics of canadian humour are irony parody and satire.303 many canadian comedians have archived international success in the american tv and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world.304 canada has a well-developed media sector but its cultural output particularly in english films television shows and magazines is often overshadowed by imports from the united states.305 as a result the preservation of a distinctly canadian culture is supported by federal government programs laws and institutions such as the canadian broadcasting corporation cbc the national film board of canada nfb and the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission crtc.306 symbols canada's national symbols are influenced by natural historical and indigenous sources the use of the maple leaf as a canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century the maple leaf is depicted on canada's current and previous flags

derived from the british version.309 the great seal of canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state being set on letters patent proclamations and commissions for representatives of the queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers lieutenant governors senators and judges.310311 other prominent symbols include the beaver canada goose and common loon the crown the royal canadian

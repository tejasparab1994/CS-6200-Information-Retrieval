tnt equivalent tnt equivalent is a convention for expressing energy typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion the ton of tnt is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184 gigajoules1 which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton 1000 kilograms or one megagram of tnt the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energy  contents  kiloton and megatonedit the kiloton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 terajoules the megaton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 petajoules the kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impact.2 historical derivation of the valueedit alternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compared.78910 conversion to other unitsedit 1 ton tnt equivalent is approximately examplesedit relative effectiveness factoredit the relative effectiveness factor re factor relates an explosive's demolition power to that of tnt in units of the tnt equivalent/kg tnte/kg the re factor is the relative mass of tnt to which an explosive is equivalent the greater the re the more powerful the explosive re factor examplesedit * tbx thermobaric explosives or ebx enhanced blast explosives in a small confined space may have over twice the power of destruction the total power of aluminized mixtures strictly depends on the condition of explosions nuclear examplesedit see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

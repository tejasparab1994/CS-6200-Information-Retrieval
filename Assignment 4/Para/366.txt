atlantic multidecadal oscillation the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is a climate cycle that affects the sea surface temperature sst of the north atlantic ocean based on different modes on multidecadal timescales.1 while there is some support for this mode in models and in historical observations controversy exists with regard to its amplitude and in particular the attribution of sea surface temperature change to natural or anthropogenic causes especially in tropical atlantic areas important for hurricane development.2 the atlantic multidecadal oscillation is also connected with shifts in hurricane activity rainfall patterns and intensity and changes in fish populations.3  contents  definitionedit the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo was identified by schlesinger and ramankutty in 1994.4 the amo signal is usually defined from the patterns of sst variability in the north atlantic once any linear trend has been removed this detrending is intended to remove the influence of greenhouse gas-induced global warming from the analysis however if the global warming signal is significantly non-linear in time i.e not just a smooth linear increase variations in the forced signal will leak into the amo definition consequently correlations with the amo index may mask effects of global warming.5 amo indexedit ting et al however argue that the forced sst pattern is not globally uniform they separated the forced and internally generated variability using signal to noise maximizing eof analysis.2 van oldenborgh et al derived an amo index as the sst averaged over the extra-tropical north atlantic to remove the influence of enso that is greater at tropical latitude minus the regression on global mean temperature.7 guan and nigam removed the non stationary global trend and pacific natural variability before applying an eof analysis to the residual north atlantic sst.8 the linearly detrended index suggests that the north atlantic sst anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is equally divided between the externally forced component and internally generated variability and that the current peak is similar to middle twentieth century by contrast the others methodology suggest that a large portion of the north atlantic anomaly at the end of the twentieth century is externally forced.2 frajka-williams et al 2017 pointed out that recent changes in cooling of the subpolar gyre warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics increased the spatial distribution of meridional gradient in sea surface temperatures which is not captured by the amo index.3 mechanismsedit the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is important for how external forcings are linked with north atlantic ssts.13 climate impacts worldwideedit the amo is correlated to air temperatures and rainfall over much of the northern hemisphere in particular in the summer climate in north america and europe.1415 through changes in atmospheric circulation the amo can also modulate spring snowfall over the alps 16 and glaciers mass variability.17 rainfall patterns are affected in north eastern brazilian and african sahel it is also associated with changes in the frequency of north american droughts and is reflected in the frequency of severe atlantic hurricane activity.6 relation to atlantic hurricanesedit since 1995 there have been nine atlantic hurricane seasons considered extremely active by accumulated cyclone energy  1995 1996 1998 1999 2003 2004 2005 2010 and 2017.citation needed periodicity and prediction of amo shiftsedit a 2017 study predicts a continued cooling shift beginning 2014 and the authors note ..unlike the last cold period in the atlantic the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies in the atlantic is not uniformly cool but instead has anomalously cold temperatures in the subpolar gyre warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool anomalies over the tropics the tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in ssts which are not represented by the amo index value but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and storminess.3 referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

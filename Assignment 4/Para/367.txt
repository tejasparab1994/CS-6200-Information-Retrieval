new england new england is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeastern united states maine vermont new hampshire massachusetts rhode island and connecticut.a it is bordered by the state of new york to the west and by the canadian provinces of new brunswick and quebec to the northeast and north respectively the atlantic ocean is to the east and southeast and long island sound is to the south boston is new england's largest city as well as the capital of massachusetts the largest metropolitan area is greater boston which also includes worcester massachusetts the second-largest city in new england manchester the largest city in new hampshire and providence the capital and largest city of rhode island with nearly a third of the entire region's population in 1620 puritan separatist pilgrims from england first settled in the region forming the plymouth colony the second successful english settlement in america following the jamestown settlement in virginia founded in 1607 ten years later more puritans settled north of plymouth colony in boston thus forming massachusetts bay colony over the next 126 years people in the region fought in four french and indian wars until the british and their iroquois allies defeated the french and their algonquin allies in north america in 1692 the town of salem massachusetts and surrounding areas experienced the salem witch trials one of the most infamous cases of mass hysteria in the history of the western hemisphere.10 in the late 18th century political leaders from the new england colonies known as the sons of liberty initiated resistance to britain's efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists the boston tea party was a protest to which britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping massachusetts of self-government which were termed the intolerable acts by the colonists the confrontation led to the first battles of the american revolutionary war in 1775 and the expulsion of the british authorities from the region in spring 1776 the region also played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery in the united states and was the first region of the u.s transformed by the industrial revolution centered on the blackstone and merrimack river valleys the physical geography of new england is diverse for such a small area southeastern new england is covered by a narrow coastal plain while the western and northern regions are dominated by the rolling hills and worn-down peaks of the northern end of the appalachian mountains the atlantic fall line lies close to the coast which enabled numerous cities to take advantage of water power along the numerous rivers such as the connecticut river which bisects the region from north to south each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as towns many of which are governed by town meetings the only unincorporated areas in the region exist in the sparsely populated northern regions of maine new hampshire and vermont the region is one of the u.s census bureau's nine regional divisions and the only multi-state region with clear consistent boundaries it maintains a strong sense of cultural identity11 although the terms of this identity are often contrasted combining puritanism with liberalism agrarian life with industry and isolation with immigration contents historyedit eastern algonquian peoplesedit the earliest known inhabitants of new england were american indians who spoke a variety of the eastern algonquian languages.12 prominent tribes included the abenakis mi'kmaq penobscot pequots mohegans narragansetts pocumtucks and wampanoag.12 prior to the arrival of european settlers the western abenakis inhabited new hampshire new york and vermont as well as parts of quebec and western maine.13 their principal town was norridgewock in present-day maine.14 the penobscot lived along the penobscot river in maine the narragansetts and smaller tribes under narragansett sovereignty lived in most of modern-day rhode island west of narragansett bay including block island the wampanoag occupied southeastern massachusetts rhode island and the islands of martha's vineyard and nantucket the pocumtucks lived in western massachusetts and the mohegan and pequot tribes lived in the connecticut region the connecticut river valley includes parts of vermont new hampshire massachusetts and connecticut linking numerous tribes culturally linguistically and politically.12 as early as 1600 french dutch and english traders began exploring the new world trading metal glass and cloth for local beaver pelts.1215 colonial periodedit the virginia companiesedit on april 10 1606 king james i of england issued a charter for the virginia company which comprised the london company and the plymouth company these two privately funded ventures were intended to claim land for england to conduct trade and to return a profit in 1620 pilgrims from the mayflower established plymouth colony in present-day massachusetts beginning the history of permanent european settlement in new england.16 plymouth council for new englandedit in 1616 english explorer john smith named the region new england.17 the name was officially sanctioned on november 3 162018 when the charter of the virginia company of plymouth was replaced by a royal charter for the plymouth council for new england a joint-stock company established to colonize and govern the region.19 as the first colonists arrived in plymouth they wrote and signed the mayflower compact20 their first governing document.21 the massachusetts bay colony came to dominate the area and was established by royal charter in 16292223 with its major town and port of boston established in 1630.24 massachusetts puritans began to settle in connecticut as early as 1633.25 roger williams was banished from massachusetts for heresy led a group south and founded providence plantation in the area that became the colony of rhode island and providence plantations in 1636.2627 at this time vermont was yet unsettled and the territories of new hampshire and maine were claimed and governed by massachusetts.28 french and indian warsedit relationships between colonists and local indian tribes alternated between peace and armed skirmishes the bloodiest of which was the pequot war in 1637 which resulted in the mystic massacre.29 on may 19 1643 the colonies of massachusetts bay plymouth new haven and connecticut joined together in a loose compact called the new england confederation officially the united colonies of new england the confederation was designed largely to coordinate mutual defense and gained some importance during king philip's war.30 from june 1675 through april 1678 king philip's war pitted the colonists and their indian allies against a widespread indian uprising resulting in killings and massacres on both sides.31 during the next 74 years there were six colonial wars that took place primarily between new england and new france see the french and indian wars as well as father rale's war and father le loutre's war throughout these wars new england was allied with the iroquois confederacy and new france was allied with the wabanaki confederacy after the new england conquest of acadia in 1710 mainland nova scotia was under the control of new england but both present-day new brunswick and virtually all of present-day maine remained contested territory between new england and new france after the british won the war in 1763 the connecticut river valley was opened for british settlement into western new hampshire and what is today vermont the new england colonies were settled primarily by farmers who became relatively self-sufficient later new england's economy began to focus on crafts and trade aided by the puritan work ethic in contrast to the southern colonies which focused on agricultural production while importing finished goods from england.32 dominion of new englandedit by 1686 king james ii had become concerned about the increasingly independent ways of the colonies including their self-governing charters their open flouting of the navigation acts and their growing military power he therefore established the dominion of new england an administrative union comprising all of the new england colonies.38 in 1688 the former dutch colonies of new york east new jersey and west new jersey were added to the dominion the union was imposed from the outside and contrary to the rooted democratic tradition of the region and it was highly unpopular among the colonists.39 the dominion significantly modified the charters of the colonies including the appointment of royal governors to nearly all of them there was an uneasy tension between the royal governors their officers and the elected governing bodies of the colonies the governors wanted unlimited authority and the different layers of locally elected officials would often resist them in most cases the local town governments continued operating as self-governing bodies just as they had before the appointment of the governors.40 after the glorious revolution in 1689 bostonians overthrew royal governor sir edmund andros they seized dominion officials and adherents to the church of england during a popular and bloodless uprising.41 these tensions eventually culminated in the american revolution boiling over with the outbreak of the war of american independence in 1775 the first battles of the war were fought in lexington and concord massachusetts later leading to the siege of boston by continental troops in march 1776 british forces were compelled to retreat from boston new england in the new nationedit post-revolutionary new englandedit after the dissolution of the dominion of new england the colonies of new england ceased to function as a unified political unit but remained a defined cultural region by 1784 all of the states in the region had taken steps towards the abolition of slavery with vermont and massachusetts introducing total abolition in 1777 and 1783 respectively.42 the nickname yankeeland was sometimes used to denote the new england area especially among southerners and british.43 after settling a dispute with new york vermont was admitted to statehood in 1791 formally completing the defined area of new england on march 15 1820 as part of the missouri compromise the territory of maine formerly a part of massachusetts was admitted to the union as a free state.44 today new england is defined as the six states of connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire rhode island and vermont.5 for the rest of the period before the american civil war new england remained distinct from the rest of the united states new england's economic growth relied heavily on trade with the british empire45 and the region's merchants and politicians strongly opposed trade restrictions as the united states and the united kingdom fought the war of 1812 new england federalists organized the hartford convention in the winter of 1814 to discuss the region's grievances concerning the war and to propose changes to the constitution to protect the region's interests and maintain its political power.46 radical delegates within the convention proposed the region's secession from the united states but they were outnumbered by moderates who opposed the idea.47 politically the region often disagreed with the rest of the country.48 massachusetts and connecticut were among the last refuges of the federalist party and new england became the strongest bastion of the new whig party when the second party system began in the 1830s the whigs were usually dominant throughout new england except in the more democratic maine and new hampshire leading statesmen hailed from the region including daniel webster new england was distinct in other ways as well many notable literary and intellectual figures were new englanders produced by the united states before the american civil war including ralph waldo emerson henry david thoreau nathaniel hawthorne henry wadsworth longfellow john greenleaf whittier george bancroft and william h prescott.49 industrial revolutionedit new england was key to the industrial revolution in the united states.50 the blackstone valley running through massachusetts and rhode island has been called the birthplace of america's industrial revolution.51 in 1787 the first cotton mill in america was founded in the north shore seaport of beverly massachusetts as the beverly cotton manufactory.52 the manufactory was also considered the largest cotton mill of its time technological developments and achievements from the manufactory led to the development of more advanced cotton mills including slater mill in pawtucket rhode island towns such as lawrence massachusetts lowell massachusetts woonsocket rhode island and lewiston maine became centers of the textile industry following the innovations at slater mill and the beverly cotton manufactory.citation needed the connecticut river valley became a crucible for industrial innovation particularly the springfield armory pioneering such advances as interchangeable parts and the assembly line which influenced manufacturing processes all around the world.53 from early in the nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth the region surrounding springfield massachusetts and hartford connecticut served as the united states epicenter for advanced manufacturing drawing skilled workers from all over the world.5455 the rapid growth of textile manufacturing in new england between 1815 and 1860 caused a shortage of workers recruiters were hired by mill agents to bring young women and children from the countryside to work in the factories between 1830 and 1860 thousands of farm girls moved from rural areas where there was no paid employment to work in the nearby mills such as the famous lowell mill girls as the textile industry grew immigration also grew by the 1850s immigrants began working in the mills especially irish and french canadians.56 new england as a whole was the most industrialized part of the u.s by 1850 the region accounted for well over a quarter of all manufacturing value in the country and over a third of its industrial workforce.57 it was also the most literate and most educated region in the country.57 anti-slaveryedit during the same period new england and areas settled by new englanders upstate new york ohio's western reserve and the upper midwestern states of michigan and wisconsin were the center of the strongest abolitionist and anti-slavery movements in the united states coinciding with the protestant great awakening in the region.58 abolitionists who demanded immediate emancipation such as william lloyd garrison john greenleaf whittier and wendell phillips had their base in the region so too did anti-slavery politicians who wanted to limit the growth of slavery such as john quincy adams charles sumner and john p hale when the anti-slavery republican party was formed in the 1850s all of new england including areas that had previously been strongholds for both the whig and the democratic parties became strongly republican new england remained solidly republican until catholics began to mobilize behind the democrats especially in 1928 and up until the republican party realigned its politics in a shift known as the southern strategy this led to the end of yankee republicanism and began new england's relatively swift transition into a consistently democratic stronghold.59 20th century and beyondedit the flow of immigrants continued at a steady pace from the 1840s until cut off by world war i the largest numbers came from ireland and britain before 1890 and after that from quebec italy and southern europe the immigrants filled the ranks of factory workers craftsmen and unskilled laborers the irish assumed a larger and larger role in the democratic parts in the cities and statewide while the rural areas remained republican yankees left the farms which never were highly productive many headed west while others became professionals and businessmen in the new england cities great depressionedit the great depression in the united states of the 1930s hit the region hard with high unemployment in the industrial cities the democrats appealed to factory workers and especially catholics pulling them into the new deal coalition and making the once-republican region into one that was closely divided however the enormous spending on munitions ships electronics and uniforms during world war ii caused a burst of prosperity in every sector deindustrializationedit the region lost most of its factories starting with the loss of textiles in the 1930s and getting worse after 1960 the new england economy was radically transformed after world war ii the factory economy practically disappeared like urban centers in the rust belt once-bustling new england communities fell into economic decay following the flight of the region's industrial base the textile mills one by one went out of business from the 1920s to the 1970s for example the crompton company after 178 years in business went bankrupt in 1984 costing the jobs of 2450 workers in five states the major reasons were cheap imports the strong dollar declining exports and a failure to diversify.60 shoes followed what remains is very high technology manufacturing such as jet engines nuclear submarines pharmaceuticals robotics scientific instruments and medical devices mit the massachusetts institute of technology invented the format for university-industry relations in high tech fields and spawned many software and hardware firms some of which grew rapidly.61 by the 21st century the region had become famous for its leadership roles in the fields of education medicine and medical research high-technology finance and tourism.62 some industrial areas were slow in adjusting to the new service economy in 2000 new england had two of the ten poorest cities by percentage living below the poverty line in the u.s. the state capitals of providence rhode island and hartford connecticut.63 they were no longer in the bottom ten by 2010 connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire remain among the ten wealthiest states in the united states in terms of median household income and per capita income.64 cities and urban areasedit metropolitan areasedit the following are metropolitan statistical areas as defined by the united states census bureau state capitalsedit geographyedit geologyedit new england's long rolling hills mountains and jagged coastline are glacial landforms resulting from the retreat of ice sheets approximately 18000 years ago during the last glacial period.6768 new england is geologically a part of the new england province an exotic terrane region consisting of the appalachian mountains the new england highlands and the seaboard lowlands.69 the appalachian mountains roughly follow the border between new england and new york the berkshires in massachusetts and connecticut and the green mountains in vermont as well as the taconic mountains form a spine of precambrian rock.70 the appalachians extend northwards into new hampshire as the white mountains and then into maine and canada mount washington in new hampshire is the highest peak in the northeast although it is not among the ten highest peaks in the eastern united states.71 it is the site of the second highest recorded wind speed on earth7273 and has the reputation of having the world's most severe weather.7475 climateedit in central and eastern massachusetts southeastern new hampshire rhode island and most of connecticut the same humid continental prevails dfa though summers are warm to hot winters are shorter and there is less snowfall especially in the coastal areas where it is often warmer southern and coastal connecticut is the broad transition zone from the cold continental climates of the north to the milder temperate/subtropical climates to the south the frost free season is greater than 180 days across far southern/coastal connecticut coastal rhode island and the islands nantucket and martha's vineyard winters also tend to be much sunnier in southern connecticut and southern rhode island compared to the rest of new england.76 demographicsedit in 2010 new england had a population of 14444865 a growth of 3.8 from 2000.77 this grew to an estimated 14727584 by 2015.78 massachusetts is the most populous state with 6794422 residents while vermont is the least populous state with 626042 residents.77 boston is by far the region's most populous city and metropolitan area white americans make up the majority of new england's population at 83.4 of the total population hispanic and latino americans are new england's largest minority and they are the second-largest group in the region behind non-hispanic european americans as of 2014 hispanics and latinos of any race made up 10.2 of new england's population connecticut had the highest proportion at 13.9% while vermont had the lowest at 1.3% there were nearly 1.5 million hispanic and latino individuals reported in new england in 2014 puerto ricans were the most numerous of the hispanic and latino subgroups over 660000 puerto ricans lived in new england in 2014 forming 4.5 of the population the dominican population is over 200000 and the mexican and guatemalan populations are each over 100000.80 americans of cuban descent are scant in number there were roughly 26000 cuban americans in the region in 2014 people of all other hispanic and latino ancestries including salvadoran colombian and bolivian formed 2.5 of new england's population and numbered over 361000 combined.80 according to the 2014 american community survey the top ten largest reported european ancestries were the following:81 as of 2014 approximately 87 of new england's inhabitants were born in the u.s. while over 12 were foreign-born.85 35.8 of foreign-born residents were born in latin america 28.6 were born in asia 22.9 were born in europe and 8.5 were born in africa.86 southern new england forms an integral part of the boswash megalopolis a conglomeration of urban centers that spans from boston to washington d.c the region includes three of the four most densely populated states in the u.s. only new jersey has a higher population density than the states of rhode island massachusetts and connecticut greater boston which includes parts of southern new hampshire has a total population of approximately 4.8 million87 while over half the population of new england falls inside boston's combined statistical area of over 8.2 million.88 largest citiesedit the most populous cities as of the census bureau's 2014 estimates were metropolitan areas in parentheses:8789 during the 20th century urban expansion in regions surrounding new york city has become an important economic influence on neighboring connecticut parts of which belong to the new york metropolitan area the u.s census bureau groups fairfield new haven and litchfield counties in western connecticut together with new york city and other parts of new york and new jersey as a combined statistical area.90 1 boston massachusetts 2 worcester massachusetts

11 cambridge massachusetts 12 waterbury connecticut 13 new bedford massachusetts 14 brockton massachusetts 15 quincy massachusetts economyedit overviewedit several factors combine to make the new england economy unique the region is distant from the geographic center of the country and is a relatively small region and relatively densely populated it historically has been an important center of industrial manufacturing and a supplier of natural resource products such as granite lobster and codfish new england exports food products ranging from fish to lobster cranberries maine potatoes and maple syrup the service industry is important including tourism education financial and insurance services plus architectural building and construction services the u.s department of commerce has called the new england economy a microcosm for the entire u.s economy.91 in the first half of the 20th century the region underwent a long period of deindustrialization as traditional manufacturing companies relocated to the midwest with textile and furniture manufacturing migrating to the south in the mid-to-late 20th century an increasing portion of the regional economy included high technology including computer and electronic equipment manufacturing military defense industry finance and insurance services as well as education and health services as of 2015 the gdp of new england was $953.9 billion.92 exportsedit exports consist mostly of industrial products including specialized machines and weaponry aircraft and missiles especially built by the region's educated workforce about half of the region's exports consist of industrial and commercial machinery such as computers and electronic and electrical equipment this when combined with instruments chemicals and transportation equipment makes up about three-quarters of the region's exports granite is quarried at barre vermont93 guns made at springfield massachusetts and saco maine boats at groton connecticut and bath maine and hand tools at turners falls massachusetts insurance is a driving force in and around hartford connecticut.91 agricultureedit agriculture is limited by the area's rocky soil cool climate and small area some new england states however are ranked highly among u.s states for particular areas of production maine is ranked ninth for aquaculture94 and has abundant potato fields in its northeast part vermont is fifteenth for dairy products95 and connecticut and massachusetts seventh and eleventh for tobacco respectively.9697 cranberries are grown in massachusetts cape cod-plymouth-south shore area and blueberries in maine energyedit three of the six new england states are among the country's highest consumers of nuclear power vermont first 73.7% connecticut fourth 48.9% and new hampshire sixth 46%.98 the region is mostly energy-efficient compared to the u.s at large with every state but maine ranking within the ten most energy-efficient states;99 every state in new england also ranks within the ten most expensive states for electricity prices.100 employmentedit as of january 2017 employment is stronger in new england than in the rest of the united states during the great recession unemployment rates ballooned across new england as elsewhere however in the years that followed these rates declined steadily with new hampshire and massachusetts having the lowest unemployment rates in the country respectively the most extreme swing was in rhode island which had an unemployment rate above 10 following the recession but which saw this rate decline by over 6 in six years as of december 2016 the metropolitan statistical area msa with the lowest unemployment rate 2.1% was burlington-south burlington vermont the msa with the highest rate 4.9% was waterbury connecticut.103 governmentedit town meetingsedit new england town meetings were derived from meetings held by church elders and are still an integral part of government in many new england towns at such meetings any citizen of the town may discuss issues with other members of the community and vote on them this is the strongest example of direct democracy in the u.s today and the strong democratic tradition was even apparent in the early 19th century when alexis de tocqueville wrote in democracy in america by contrast james madison wrote in federalist no 55 that regardless of the assembly passion never fails to wrest the scepter from reason had every athenian citizen been a socrates every athenian assembly would still have been a mob.105 the use and effectiveness of town meetings is still discussed by scholars as well as the possible application of the format to other regions and countries.106 politicsedit electionsedit state and national elected officials in new england recently have been elected mainly from the democratic party.107 the region is generally considered to be the most liberal in the united states with more new englanders identifying as liberals than americans elsewhere in 2010 four of six of the new england states were polled as the most liberal in the united states maine and new hampshire also were more liberal than the bottom-half.108 the six states of new england voted for the democratic presidential nominee in the 1992 1996 2004 2008 2012 and 2016 elections and every new england state other than new hampshire voted for al gore in the presidential election of 2000 in the 113th congress the house delegations from all six states of new england were all democratic new england is home to the only two independents currently serving in the u.s senate both of whom caucus with the democratic party bernie sanders a self-described democratic socialist109110 representing vermont and angus king an independent representing maine in the 2008 presidential election barack obama carried all six new england states by 9 percentage points or more.111 he carried every county in new england except for piscataquis county maine which he lost by 4 to senator john mccain r-az pursuant to the reapportionment following the 2010 census new england collectively has 33 electoral votes the following table presents the vote percentage for the popular-vote winner for each new england state new england as a whole and the united states as a whole in each presidential election from 1900 to 2016 with the vote percentage for the republican candidate shaded in red and the vote percentage for the democratic candidate shaded in blue political party strengthedit judging purely by party registration rather than voting patterns new england today is one of the most democratic regions in the u.s.112113114 according to gallup connecticut massachusetts rhode island and vermont are solidly democratic maine leans democratic and new hampshire is a swing state.115 though new england is today considered a democratic party stronghold much of the region was staunchly republican before the mid-twentieth century this changed in the late 20th century in large part due to demographic shifts116 and the republican party's adoption of socially conservative platforms as part of their strategic shift towards the south.59 for example vermont voted republican in every presidential election but one from 1856 through 1988 and has voted democratic every election since maine and vermont were the only two states in the nation to vote against democrat franklin d roosevelt all four times he ran for president republicans in new england are today considered by both liberals and conservatives to be more moderate socially liberal compared to republicans in other parts of the u.s.117 new hampshire primaryedit historically the new hampshire primary has been the first in a series of nationwide political party primary elections held in the united states every four years held in the state of new hampshire it usually marks the beginning of the u.s presidential election process even though few delegates are chosen from new hampshire the primary has always been pivotal to both new england and american politics one college in particular saint anselm college has been home to numerous national presidential debates and visits by candidates to its campus.118 educationedit colleges and universitiesedit new england contains some of the oldest and most renowned institutions of higher learning in the united states and the world harvard college was the first such institution founded in 1636 at cambridge massachusetts to train preachers yale university was founded in saybrook connecticut in 1701 and awarded the nation's first doctoral phd degree in 1861 yale moved to new haven connecticut in 1718 where it has remained to the present day brown university was the first college in the nation to accept students of all religious affiliations and is the seventh oldest u.s institution of higher learning it was founded in providence rhode island in 1764 dartmouth college was founded five years later in hanover new hampshire with the mission of educating the local american indian population as well as english youth the university of vermont the fifth oldest university in new england was founded in 1791 the same year that vermont joined the union in addition to four out of eight ivy league schools new england contains the massachusetts institute of technology mit four of the original seven sisters the bulk of educational institutions that are identified as the little ivies one of the eight original public ivies the colleges of worcester consortium in central massachusetts and the five colleges consortium in western massachusetts the university of maine the university of new hampshire the university of connecticut the university of massachusetts at amherst the university of rhode island and the university of vermont are the flagship state universities in the region private and independent secondary schoolsedit at the pre-college level new england is home to a number of american independent schools also known as private schools the concept of the elite new england prep school preparatory school and the preppy lifestyle is an iconic part of the region's image.119 public educationedit new england is home to some of the oldest public schools in the nation boston latin school is the oldest public school in america and was attended by several signatories of the declaration of independence.120 hartford public high school is the second oldest operating high school in the u.s.121 as of 2005 the national education association ranked connecticut as having the highest-paid teachers in the country massachusetts and rhode island ranked eighth and ninth respectively new hampshire rhode island and vermont have cooperated in developing a new england common assessment program test under the no child left behind guidelines these states can compare the resultant scores with each other the maine learning technology initiative program supplies all students with apple macbook laptops academic journals and pressedit there are several academic journals and publishing companies in the region including the new england journal of medicine harvard university press and yale university press some of its institutions lead the open access alternative to conventional academic publication including mit the university of connecticut and the university of maine the federal reserve bank of boston publishes the new england economic review.122 cultureedit today new england is the least religious region of the u.s in 2009 less than half of those polled in maine massachusetts new hampshire and vermont claimed that religion was an important part of their daily lives in connecticut and rhode island also among the ten least religious states 55 and 53% respectively of those polled claimed that it was.126 according to the american religious identification survey 34 of vermonters a plurality claimed to have no religion on average nearly one out of every four new englanders identifies as having no religion more than in any other part of the u.s.127 new england had one of the highest percentages of catholics in the u.s this number declined from 50 in 1990 to 36 in 2008.127 cultural rootsedit many of the first european colonists of new england had a maritime orientation toward whaling first noted about 1650128 and fishing in addition to farming new england has developed a distinct cuisine dialect architecture and government new england cuisine has a reputation for its emphasis on seafood and dairy clam chowder lobster and other products of the sea are among some of the region's most popular foods new england has largely preserved its regional character especially in its historic places the region has become more ethnically diverse having seen waves of immigration from ireland quebec italy portugal poland asia latin america africa other parts of the u.s. and elsewhere the enduring european influence can be seen in the region in the use of traffic rotaries the bilingual french and english towns of northern vermont maine and new hampshire the region's heavy prevalence of english town and county-names and its unique often non-rhotic coastal dialect reminiscent of southeastern england within new england many names of towns and a few counties repeat from state to state primarily due to settlers throughout the region having named their new towns after their old ones for example the town of north yarmouth maine was named by settlers from yarmouth massachusetts which was in turn named for great yarmouth in england as another example every new england state has a town named warren and every state except rhode island has a city or town named andover bridgewater chester franklin manchester plymouth washington and windsor in addition every state except connecticut has a lincoln and a richmond and massachusetts vermont and maine each contains a franklin county accentsedit there are several american english accents spoken in the region including new england english and its derivative known as the boston accent the so-called boston accent is native to the northeastern coastal regions of new england many of its most identifiable features are believed to have originated from the influence of england's received pronunciation which shares those features such as dropping final r and the broad a another source was 17th century speech in east anglia and lincolnshire where many of the puritan immigrants originated the east anglian whine developed into the yankee twang.124 boston accents were most strongly associated at one point with the so-called eastern establishment and boston's upper class although today the accent is predominantly associated with blue-collar natives as exemplified by movies such as good will hunting and the departed the boston accent and those accents closely related to it cover eastern massachusetts new hampshire and maine.129 social activities and

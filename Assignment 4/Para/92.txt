ocean as the world ocean is the principal component of earth's hydrosphere it is integral to life forms part of the carbon cycle and influences climate and weather patterns the world ocean is the habitat of 230000 known species but because much of it is unexplored the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger possibly over two million.10 the origin of earth's oceans is unknown oceans are thought to have formed in the hadean eon and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water or other elements and compounds the only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of titan although there is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere in the solar system early in their geologic histories mars and venus are theorized to have had large water oceans the mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of mars was once covered by water and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of venus compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites notably the ocean of europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of earth the solar system's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.1112  contents  etymology earth's global ocean oceanic divisions though generally described as several separate oceans the global interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the world ocean or global ocean.1516 the concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.17 the major oceanic divisions  listed below in descending order of area and volume  are defined in part by the continents various archipelagos and other criteria.91218 oceans are fringed by smaller adjoining bodies of water such as seas gulfs bays bights and straits global system physical properties the bluish color of water is a composite of several contributing agents prominent contributors include dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll.31 mariners and other seafarers have reported that the ocean often emits a visible glow which extends for miles at night in 2005 scientists announced that for the first time they had obtained photographic evidence of this glow.32 it is most likely caused by bioluminescence.333435 oceanic zones the pelagic zone can be further subdivided into two subregions the neritic zone and the oceanic zone the neritic zone encompasses the water mass directly above the continental shelves whereas the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water in contrast the littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions it is also known as the intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region the halocline often coincides with the thermocline and the combination produces a pronounced pycnocline exploration oceanic maritime currents oceanic maritime currents have different origins tidal currents are in phase with the tide hence are quasiperiodic they may fomulate various knots in certain placesclarification needed most notably around headlands non periodic currents have for origin the waves wind and different densities this acceleration of the current takes place in the direction of waves and dominant wind accordingly when the sea depth increases the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed at a certain sea depth the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul known as the ekman spiral the influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth these currents can considerably alter change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons if the mixed layer is less thick 10 to 20 meters the quasi permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind becoming virtually homogeneous until the thermocline.38 in the deep however maritime currents are caused by the temperature gradients and the salinity between water density masses in littoral zones breaking wave is so intense and the depth measurement so low that maritime currents reach often 1 to 2 knots climate ocean currents greatly affect earth's climate by transferring heat from the tropics to the polar regions transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions winds may carry them inland surface heat and freshwater fluxes create global density gradients that drive the thermohaline circulation part of large-scale ocean circulation it plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions and thus in sea ice regulation changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on earth's energy budget in so far as the thermohaline circulation governs the rate at which deep waters reach the surface it may also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for a discussion of the possibilities of changes to the thermohaline circulation under global warming see shutdown of thermohaline circulation it is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that the climate of western europe is so temperate an alternate hypothesis claims that this is largely incorrect and that europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin and because atmospheric waves bring warm air north from the subtropics.3940 the antarctic circumpolar current encircles that continent influencing the area's climate and connecting currents in several oceans one of the most dramatic forms of weather occurs over the oceans tropical cyclones also called typhoons and hurricanes depending upon where the system forms biology the ocean has a significant effect on the biosphere oceanic evaporation as a phase of the water cycle is the source of most rainfall and ocean temperatures determine climate and wind patterns that affect life on land life within the ocean evolved 3 billion years prior to life on land both the depth and the distance from shore strongly influence the biodiversity of the plants and animals present in each region.41 lifeforms native to the ocean include in addition many land animals have adapted to living a major part of their life on the oceans for instance seabirds are a diverse group of birds that have adapted to a life mainly on the oceans they feed on marine animals and spend most of their lifetime on water many only going on land for breeding other birds that have adapted to oceans as their living space are penguins seagulls and pelicans seven species of turtles the sea turtles also spend most of their time in the oceans gases surface mixing time the residence time is the amount of an element in the ocean divided by the rate at which that element is added to or removed from the ocean the mean oceanic mixing time is thought to be approximately 1600 years if a given element in the ocean stays in the ocean on average longer than the oceanic mixing time then that element is assumed to be homogeneously spread throughout the ocean as a result because the major salts have a residence time that is longer than 1600 years the ratio of major salts is thought to be unchanging across the ocean this constant ratio is often referred to as forchhammer's principle or the principle of constant proportions salinity salinity can be calculated using the chlorinity which is a measure of the total mass of halogen ions includes fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine in seawater by international agreement the following formula is used to determine salinity absorption of light economic value many of the world's goods are moved by ship between the world's seaports.citation needed oceans are also the major supply source for the fishing industry some of the major harvests are shrimp fish crabs and lobster.6 waves and swell the motions of the ocean surface known as undulations or waves are the partial and alternate rising and falling of the ocean surface the series of mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air is called swell.citation needed extraterrestrial oceans although earth is the only known planet with large stable bodies of liquid water on its surface and the only one in the solar system other celestial bodies are thought to have large oceans.58 planets the gas giants jupiter and saturn are thought to lack surfaces and instead have a stratum of liquid hydrogen however their planetary geology is not well understood the possibility of the ice giants uranus and neptune having hot highly compressed supercritical water under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised although their composition is still not fully understood a 2006 study by wiktorowicz and ingersall ruled out the possibility of such a water ocean existing on neptune59 though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible.60 the mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of mars was once covered by water though the water on mars is no longer oceanic much of it residing in the ice caps the possibility continues to be studied along with reasons for their apparent disappearance astronomers think that venus had liquid water and perhaps oceans in its very early history.citation needed if they existed all later vanished via resurfacing natural satellites dwarf planets and trans-neptunian objects ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle and may harbour a liquid-water ocean under its surface.6667 not enough is known of the larger trans-neptunian objects to determine whether they are differentiated bodies capable of supporting oceans although models of radioactive decay suggest that pluto68 eris sedna and orcus have oceans beneath solid icy crusts approximately 100 to 180 km thick.65 extrasolar some planets and natural satellites outside the solar system are likely to have oceans including possible water ocean planets similar to earth in the habitable zone or liquid-water belt the detection of oceans even through the spectroscopy method however is likely extremely difficult and inconclusive theoretical models have been used to predict with high probability that gj 1214 b detected by transit is composed of exotic form of ice vii making up 75 of its mass69 making it an ocean planet other possible candidates are merely speculated based on their mass and position in the habitable zone include planet though little is actually known of their composition some scientists speculate kepler-22b may be an ocean-like planet.70 models have been proposed for gliese 581 d that could include surface oceans gliese 436 b is speculated to have an ocean of hot ice.71 exomoons orbiting planets particularly gas giants within their parent star's habitable zone may theoretically have surface oceans non-water surface liquids supercritical fluids although not liquids do share various properties with liquids underneath the thick atmospheres of the planets uranus and neptune it is expected that these planets are composed of oceans of hot high-density fluid mixtures of water ammonia and other volatiles.85 the gaseous outer layers of jupiter and saturn transition smoothly into oceans of supercritical hydrogen.8687 the atmosphere of venus is 96.5 carbon dioxide which is a supercritical fluid at its surface see also on other bodies references further reading external links navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction

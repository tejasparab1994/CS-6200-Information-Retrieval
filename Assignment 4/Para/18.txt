wet season the rainy season or monsoon season is the time of year when most of a region's average annual rainfall occurs it usually lasts one or more months.1 the term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities.2 areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.3 when the wet season occurs during a warm season or summer precipitation falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening in the wet season air quality improves fresh water quality improves and vegetation grows substantially leading to crop yields late in the season rivers overflow their banks and some animals retreat to higher ground soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases the incidence of malaria increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures particularly in tropical areas.7 some animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wet season often the previous dry season leads to food shortages in the wet season as the crops have yet to mature  contents  character of the rainfalledit in areas where the heavy rainfall is associated with a wind shift the wet season is known as the monsoon.8 rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions further much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour6 before the storms mature into their stratiform stage.9 most places have only one wet season but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons because the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year however since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year they do not have a wet season.5 areas affectededit areas with a savanna climate in sub-saharan africa such as ghana burkina faso1314 darfur15 eritrea16 ethiopia17 and botswana have a distinct rainy season.18 also within the savanna climate regime florida and south texas have a rainy season.19 monsoon regions include the indian subcontinent southeast asia including indonesia and philippines20 northern sections of australia's north21 polynesia22 central america23 western and southern mexico24 the desert southwest of the united states10 southern guyana25 portions of northeast brazil.26 northern guyana has two wet seasons one in early spring and the other in early winter.25 in western africa there are two rainy seasons across southern sections but only one across the north.27 within the mediterranean climate regime the west coast of the united states and the mediterranean coastline of italy greece28 and turkey experience a wet season in the winter months.29 similarly the wet season in the negev desert of israel extends from october through may.30 at the boundary between the mediterranean and monsoon climates lies the sonoran desert which receives the two rainy seasons associated with each climate regime.31 the wet season is known by many different local names throughout the world for example in mexico it is known as storm season different names are given to the various short seasons of the year by the aboriginal tribes of northern australia the wet season typically experienced there from december to march is called gudjewg the precise meaning of the word is disputed although it is widely accepted to relate to the severe thunderstorms flooding and abundant vegetation growth commonly experienced at this time.32 effectsedit floodsedit high rainfall can cause widespread flooding39 which can lead to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas.40 such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes.41 the ghaggar-hakra river which only flows during india's monsoon season can flood and severely damage local crops.42 floods can be exacerbated by fires that occurred during the previous dry season which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic or water repellent.43 in various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding.44 instructions on controlling erosion through outreachclarification needed are also provided by telephone or the internet.45 life adaptationsedit humansedit the wet season is the main period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime.46 however this also means that wet season is a time for food shortages before crops reach their full maturity.47 this causes seasonal weight changes for people in developing countries with a drop occurring during the wet season until the time of the first harvest when weights rebound.48 malaria incidence increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall.49 animalsedit cows calve or give birth at the beginning of the wet season.50 the onset of the rainy season signals the departure of the monarch butterfly from mexico.51 tropical species of butterflies show larger dot markings on their wings to fend off possible predators and are more active during the wet season than the dry season.52 within the tropics and warmer areas of the subtropics decreased salinity of near shore wetlands due to the rains causes an increase in crocodile nesting.53 other species such as the arroyo toad spawn within the couple of months after the seasonal rains.54 armadillos and rattlesnakes seek higher ground.55 see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools

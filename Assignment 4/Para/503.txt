national diet library the national diet library ndl consists of two main facilities in tokyo and kyoto and several other branch libraries throughout japan  contents  historyedit the national diet

diet in 1890 and the imperial library which had been established in 1872 under the jurisdiction of the ministry of education the diet's power in prewar japan was limited and its need for information was correspondingly small. the original diet libraries never developed either the collections or the services which might have made them vital adjuncts of genuinely responsible legislative activity.

macarthur deemed reform of the diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of japan after its defeat in world war ii though the ndl's original mandate was to be a research library for the national diet the general public is the largest consumer of the library's services in the fiscal year ending march 2004 for example the library reported more than 250000 reference

tropical cyclone warnings and watches tropical cyclone warnings and watches are two levels of alert issued by national weather forecasting bodies to coastal areas threatened by the imminent approach of a tropical cyclone of tropical storm or hurricane intensity they are notices to the local population and civil authorities to make appropriate preparation for the cyclone including evacuation of vulnerable areas where necessary it is important that interests throughout the area of an alert make preparations to protect life and property and do not disregard it on the strength of the detailed forecast track tropical cyclones are not points and forecasting their track remains an uncertain science  contents  western hemisphereedit because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force the hurricane watch and warnings are issued in advance of the anticipated onset of tropical-storm-force winds rather than in advance of the anticipated onset of hurricane-force winds.7 at times a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch can both be in effect due to uncertainties in the forecast these watches and warnings are also issued by the central pacific hurricane center for the hawaiian islands and the weather forecast office in guam for parts of micronesia but not for american samoa due to an international agreement.8 in 2017 the national hurricane center introduced a new system of warnings and watches for storm surge which would cover the atlantic and gulf coasts of the united states a storm surge watch would be issued when a life-threatening storm surge associated with a potential or ongoing tropical subtropical or post-tropical cyclone is possible within the next 48 hours these watches would be upgraded to storm surge warnings when there is a danger of life-threatening storm surge occurring within 36 hours however both watches and warnings may be issued earlier than specified if environmental conditions are expected to hamper preparations.11 in mexico a color coded alert system is used to keep the public informed when a tropical cyclone or possible tropical cyclones poses a threat to the nation the scale starts with blue at the bottom being minimal danger then proceeds to a green alert which means low level danger a yellow alert signifies moderate danger followed by an orange alert that means high danger level the scale tops off with a red alert the maximum level of danger.12 west pacific systemsedit chinaedit a two-stage warning system was long-established in china for tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity of above.13 nowadays the use of this system is restricted to coastal waters only thus warnings may be discontinued even if a cyclone is maintaining tropical storm intensity inland color-coded alerts below may be in effect independently of any two-stage warnings guangdong introduced a color-coded tropical cyclone warning system for land use in 1999.14 similar systems were developed in fujian and shanghai later china meteorological administration standardized the system for national use.15 this set is part of a larger warning system that covers other forms of severe weather conditions such as extreme temperature torrential rainfall drought etc guangdong maintained a white alert as in the old system hong kong and macauedit the pearl river delta uses a variety of warning systems to inform the public regarding the risks of tropical cyclones to the area the hong kong observatory issues typhoon signals to indicate the existence and effects of a tropical cyclone on hong kong the macao meteorological and geophysical bureau in macau uses a similar system 16the signal system consists of 8 signals in 5 levels numbered non-consecutively for historical reasons 1718 each signal has a day signal and a night signal for hoisting which are still hoisted in macau but no longer hoisted in hong kong day signals are also used as signal symbols in both places japanedit the japan meteorological agency jma is the government agency responsible for gathering and providing results for the public in japan that are obtained from data based on daily scientific observation and research into natural phenomena in the fields of meteorology hydrology seismology and volcanology among other related scientific fields its headquarters is located in tokyo is also designated one of the regional specialized meteorological centers rsmc of the world meteorological organization it has the responsibility for weather forecasting tropical cyclone naming and distribution of warnings for tropical cyclones in the northwestern pacific region philippinesedit the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa releases tropical cyclone warnings in the form of public storm warning signals or just storm signals.19 an area having a storm signal may be under these storm signals are usually heightened when an area in the philippines only is about to be hit by a tropical cyclone thus as a tropical cyclone gains strength and/or gets closer to an area having a storm signal it may be heightened to another higher signal in that particular area whereas as a tropical cyclone weakens and/or gets farther away from an area it may be downgraded to a lower signal or may be lifted that is an area will have no storm signal  south pacific basinedit indian ocean systemsedit indiaedit the imd issues warnings in four stages for the indian coast cyclonic storm conditions mean what winds in excess of 63 km/h 39 mph are possible.22 military advisoriesedit

1970 bhola cyclone the 1970 bhola cyclone was a devastating tropical cyclone that struck east pakistan present-day bangladesh and india's west bengal on november 12 1970 it remains the deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded and one of the deadliest natural disasters up to 500000 people lost their lives in the storm primarily as a result of the storm surge that flooded much of the low-lying islands of the ganges delta this cyclone was the sixth cyclonic storm of the 1970 north indian ocean cyclone season and also the season's strongest.3 the pakistani government led by junta leader general yahya khan was criticized for its delayed handling of the relief operations following the storm both by local political leaders in east pakistan and in the international media during the election that took place a month later the opposition awami league gained a landslide victory in the province and continuing unrest between east pakistan and the central government triggered the bangladesh liberation war which led to widespread atrocities and eventually concluded with the creation of the country of bangladesh this storm as well as the bangladesh liberation war and 1971 bangladesh genocide and the subsequent refugees led ex-beatle george harrison and bengali musician ravi shankar to organize the concert for bangladesh in 1971 in madison square garden new york city.45  contents  meteorological historyedit preparationsedit impactedit the bhola cyclone is nonetheless the deadliest tropical cyclone on record and is one of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history a comparable number of people died as a result of the 1976 tangshan earthquake and the 2004 indian ocean earthquake but because of uncertainty in the number of deaths in all three disasters it may never be known which one was the deadliest.14 east pakistanedit indiaedit death tolledit two medical relief surveys were carried out by the pakistan-seato cholera research laboratory the first in november and the second in february and march the purpose of the first survey was to establish the immediate medical needs in the affected regions and the second more detailed survey was designed as the basis for long-term relief and recovery planning in the second survey approximately 1.4 of the area's population was studied.22 aftermathedit government responseedit the day after the storm struck the coast three pakistani gunboats and a hospital ship carrying medical personnel and supplies left chittagong for the islands of hatia sandwip and kutubdia.17 teams from the pakistani army reached many of the stricken areas in the two days following the landfall of the cyclone.28 pakistani president yahya khan returned from a state visit to china and overflew the disaster area on november 16 the president ordered no effort to be spared to relieve the victims.12 he also ordered that all flags should be flown at half-mast and announced a day of national mourning on november 21 a week after the cyclone struck land.29 a week after the cyclone's landfall president khan conceded that his government had made slips and mistakes in its handling of the relief efforts he said there was a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster he also said that the general election slated for december 7 would take place on time although eight or nine of the worst affected districts might experience delays denying rumours that the election would be postponed.27 as the conflict between east and west pakistan developed in march the dhaka offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks first by a general strike and then by a ban on government work in east pakistan by the awami league relief work continued in the field but the long-term planning was curtailed.33 criticism of government responseedit the pakistan red crescent began to operate independently of the government as the result of a dispute that arose after the red crescent took possession of 20 rafts donated by the british red cross.36 a pesticide company had to wait two days before it received permission for two of its crop dusters which were already in the country to carry out supply drops in the affected regions the pakistani government only deployed a single helicopter to relief operations with yahya khan later stating that there was no point deploying any helicopters from west pakistan as they were unable to carry supplies.12 political consequencesedit the awami league headed by sheikh mujibur rahman swept to a landslide victory in the national elections in december 1970 in part because of dissatisfaction over failure of the relief efforts by the national government the elections for nine national assembly and eighteen provincial assembly seats had to be postponed until january 18 as a result of the storm.38 the government's handling of the relief efforts helped exacerbate the bitterness felt in east pakistan swelling the resistance movement there funds only slowly got through and transport was slow in bringing supplies to the devastated regions as tensions increased in march foreign personnel evacuated because of fears of violence.33 the situation deteriorated further and developed into the bangladesh liberation war in march this conflict widened into the indo-pakistani war of 1971 in december and concluded with the creation of bangladesh this was one of the first times that a natural event helped to trigger a civil war.39 international responseedit the concert for bangladeshedit in 1971 ex-beatle george harrison was inspired to organize the concert for bangladesh in part from the 1970 bhola cyclone and from the 1971 bangladesh genocide and bangladesh liberation war.54 although it was the first benefit concert of its type it was extremely successful in raising money aid and awareness for the region's plight after the impactedit in december the league of red cross societies drafted a plan for immediate use should a comparable event to the cyclone hit other disaster prone countries a red cross official stated some of the relief workers sent to east pakistan were poorly trained and the organisation would compile a list of specialists the un general assembly adopted a proposal to improve its ability to provide aid to disaster-stricken countries in 1966 the red crescent had begun to support the development of a cyclone warning system which developed into a cyclone preparedness programme in 1972 today run by the government of bangladesh and the bangladesh red crescent society the programme's objectives are to raise public awareness of the risks of cyclones and to provide training to emergency personnel in the coastal regions of bangladesh.55 see alsoedit

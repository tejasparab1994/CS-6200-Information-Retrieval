united states navy u.s department of defense the united states navy usn is the naval warfare service branch of the united states armed forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the united states the u.s navy is the largest and most capable navy in the world567 with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage.89 the u.s navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet with eleven in service one in the reserve fleet1011 and two new carriers under construction.12 with 322421 personnel on active duty and 107577 in the navy reserve the navy is the third largest of the service branches it has 276 deployable combat vessels and more than 3700 operational aircraft as of june 2017update.213 the u.s navy traces its origins to the continental navy which was established during the american revolutionary war and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter the u.s navy played a major role in the american civil war by blockading the confederacy and seizing control of its rivers it played the central role in the world war ii defeat of imperial japan the 21st century u.s navy maintains a sizable global presence deploying in strength in such areas as the western pacific the mediterranean and the indian ocean it is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises making it a frequent actor in u.s foreign and military policy the navy is administratively managed by the department of the navy which is headed by the civilian secretary of the navy the department of the navy is itself a division of the department of defense which is headed by the secretary of defense the chief of naval operations cno is the most senior naval officer serving in the department of the navy.14  contents  missionedit the mission of the navy is to maintain train and equip combat-ready naval forces capable of winning wars deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas the u.s navy is a seaborne branch of the military of the united states the navy's three primary areas of responsibility:16 u.s navy training manuals state that the mission of the u.s armed forces is to prepare and conduct prompt and sustained combat operations in support of the national interest as part of that establishment the u.s navy's functions comprise sea control power projection and nuclear deterrence in addition to sealift duties.17 historyedit originsedit it follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive and with it everything honorable and glorious the navy was rooted in the colonial seafaring tradition which produced a large community of sailors captains and shipbuilders.19 in the early stages of the american revolutionary war massachusetts had its own massachusetts naval militia the rationale for establishing a national navy was debated in the second continental congress supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping defend the coast and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries detractors countered that challenging the british royal navy then the world's preeminent naval power was a foolish undertaking commander in chief george washington resolved the debate when he commissioned the ocean-going schooner uss hannah to interdict british merchant ships and reported the captures to the congress on 13 october 1775 the continental congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against british merchant ships this resolution created the continental navy and is considered the first establishment of the u.s navy.20 the continental navy achieved mixed results it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many british merchant vessels but it lost twenty-four of its vessels21 and at one point was reduced to two in active service.22 in august 1785 after the revolutionary war had drawn to a close congress had sold alliance the last ship remaining in the continental navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navy.2324 in 1972 the chief of naval operations admiral elmo zumwalt authorized the navy to celebrate its birthday on 13 october to honor the establishment of the continental navy in 1775.2520 from re-establishment to the civil waredit the u.s navy saw substantial action in the war of 1812 where it was victorious in eleven single-ship duels with the royal navy it drove all significant british forces off lake erie and lake champlain and prevented them from becoming british-controlled zones the result was a major defeat for the british invasion of new york state and the defeat of the military threat from the native american allies of the british despite this the u.s navy was unable to prevent the british from blockading its ports and landing troops.29 after the war the u.s navy again focused its attention on protecting american shipping assets sending squadrons to the caribbean the mediterranean where it participated in the second barbary war that ended piracy in the region south america africa and the pacific.21 from 1819 to the outbreak of the civil war the africa squadron operated to suppress the slave trade seizing 36 slave ships although its contribution was smaller than that of the much larger british royal navy.citation needed 20th centuryedit our ships are our natural bulwarks a modernization program beginning in the 1880s when the first steel hulled warships stimulated the american steel industry and the new steel navy was born.31 this rapid expansion of the u.s navy and its easy victory over the spanish navy in 1898 brought a new respect for american technical quality rapid building of at first pre-dreadnoughts then dreadnoughts brought the u.s in line with the navies of countries such as britain and germany in 1907 most of the navy's battleships with several support vessels dubbed the great white fleet were showcased in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world ordered by president theodore roosevelt it was a mission designed to demonstrate the navy's capability to extend to the global theater.21 by 1911 the u.s had begun building the super-dreadnoughts at a pace to eventually become competitive with britain.32 world war i and interwar yearsedit the u.s navy saw little action during world war i it concentrated on mine laying operations against german u-boats hesitation by the senior command meant that naval forces were not contributed until late 1917 battleship division nine was dispatched to britain and served as the sixth battle squadron of the british grand fleet its presence allowed the british to decommission some older ships and reuse the crews on smaller vessels destroyers and u.s naval air force units contributed to the anti-submarine operations the strength of the united states navy grew under an ambitious ship building program associated with the naval act of 1916.citation needed world war iiedit doctrine had significantly shifted by the end of the war the u.s navy had followed in the footsteps of the navies of great britain and germany which favored concentrated groups of battleships as their main offensive naval weapons.37 the development of the aircraft carrier and its devastating utilization by the japanese against the u.s at pearl harbor however shifted u.s thinking the pearl harbor attack destroyed or took out of action a significant number of u.s navy battleships this placed much of the burden of retaliating against the japanese on the small number of aircraft carriers.38 cold waredit the potential for armed conflict with the soviet union during the cold war pushed the u.s navy to continue its technological advancement by developing new weapons systems ships and aircraft u.s naval strategy changed to that of forward deployment in support of u.s allies with an emphasis on carrier battle groups.39 the navy was a major participant in the vietnam war blockaded cuba during the cuban missile crisis and through the use of ballistic missile submarines became an important aspect of the united states nuclear strategic deterrence policy the u.s navy conducted various combat operations in the persian gulf against iran in 1987 and 1988 most notably operation praying mantis the navy was extensively involved in operation urgent fury operation desert shield operation desert storm operation deliberate force operation allied force operation desert fox and operation southern watch.citation needed the u.s navy has also been involved in search and rescue/search and salvage operations sometimes in conjunction with vessels of other countries as well as with u.s coast guard ships two examples are the 1966 palomares b-52 crash incident and search for the nuclear bombs and task force 71 of the seventh fleet operation in search for korean air lines flight 007 shot down by the soviets on 1 september 1983.citation needed 21st centuryedit when a crisis confronts the nation the first question often asked by policymakers is 'what naval forces are available and how fast can they be on station? the u.s navy continues to be a major support to u.s interests in the 21st century since the end of the cold war it has shifted its focus from preparations for large-scale war with the soviet union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts.41 the navy participated in operation enduring freedom operation iraqi freedom and is a major participant in the ongoing war on terror largely in this capacity development continues on new ships and weapons including the gerald r ford-class aircraft carrier and the littoral combat ship because of its size weapons technology and ability to project force far from u.s shores the current u.s navy remains a potent asset for the united states moreover it is the principal means through which the u.s maintains international global order namely by safeguarding global trade and protecting allied nations.42 in 2010 chief of naval operations admiral gary roughead noted that demands on the navy have grown as the fleet has shrunk and that in the face of declining budgets in the future the u.s navy must rely even more on international partnerships.44 in its 2013 budget request the navy focused on retaining all eleven big deck carriers at the expense of cutting numbers of smaller ships and delaying the ssbn replacement.45 by the next year the usn found itself unable to maintain eleven aircraft carriers in the face of the expiration of budget relief offered by the bipartisan budget act of 2013 and cno jonathan greenert said that a ten ship carrier fleet would not be able to sustainably support military requirements.46 the british first sea lord george zambellas said that 47 the usn had switched from outcome-led to resource-led planning.48 one significant change in u.s policymaking that is having a major effect on naval planning is the pivot to east asia in response this secretary of the navy ray mabus has stated that 60 percent of the total u.s fleet will be deployed to the pacific by the year 2020.49 the navy's most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan published in 2016 calls for a future fleet of 350 ships in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive international environment.47 u.s navy officers aboard the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln cvn-72 monitor defense systems during early 2010s maritime security operations exercises the uss america amphibious assault ship launched in 2012 u.s navy patrol boat near kuwait naval base in 2009 organizationedit the u.s navy falls under the administration of the department of the navy under civilian leadership of the secretary of the navy secnav the most senior naval officer is the chief of naval operations cno a four-star admiral who is immediately under and reports to the secretary of the navy at the same time the chief of naval operations is one of the joint chiefs of staff which is the second-highest deliberatory body of the armed forces after the united states national security council although it only plays an advisory role to the president and does not nominally form part of the chain of command the secretary of the navy and chief of naval operations are responsible for organizing recruiting training and equipping the navy so that it is ready for operation under the command of the unified combat command commanders.citation needed operating forcesedit there are nine components in the operating forces of the u.s navy the united states fleet forces command formerly united states atlantic fleet united states pacific fleet united states naval forces central command united states naval forces europe naval network warfare command navy reserve united states naval special warfare command operational test and evaluation force and military sealift command fleet forces command controls a number of unique capabilities including military sealift command naval expeditionary combat command and navy cyber forces.citation needed shore establishmentsedit shore establishments exist to support the mission of the fleet through the use of facilities on land among the commands of the shore establishment as of april 2011update are the naval education and training command the naval meteorology and oceanography command the space and naval warfare systems command the naval facilities engineering command the naval supply systems command the naval air systems command the naval sea systems command the bureau of medicine and surgery the bureau of naval personnel the united states naval academy the naval safety center the naval strike and air warfare center and the united states naval observatory.51 official navy websites list the office of the chief of naval operations and the chief of naval operations as part of the shore establishment but these two entities effectively sit superior to the other organizations playing a coordinating role.citation needed relationships with other service branchesedit united states marine corpsedit in 1834 the united states marine corps came under the department of the navy.52 historically the navy has had a unique relationship with the usmc partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations together the navy and marine corps form the department of the navy and report to the secretary of the navy however the marine corps is a distinct separate service branch53 with its own uniformed service chief  the commandant of the marine corps a four-star general.citation needed the marine corps depends on the navy for medical support dentists doctors nurses medical technicians known as corpsmen and religious support chaplains thus navy officers and enlisted sailors fulfill these roles when attached to marine corps units deployed to an operational environment they generally wear marine camouflage uniforms but otherwise they wear navy dress uniforms unless they opt to conform to marine corps grooming standards.citation needed in the operational environment as an expeditionary force specializing in amphibious operations marines often embark on navy ships to conduct operations from beyond territorial waters marine units deploying as part of a marine air-ground task force magtf operate under the command of the existing marine chain of command although marine units routinely operate from amphibious assault ships the relationship has evolved over the years much as the commander of the carrier air group/wing cag does not work for the carrier commanding officer but coordinates with the ship's co and staff some marine aviation squadrons usually fixed-wing assigned to carrier air wings train and operate alongside navy squadrons they fly similar missions and often fly sorties together under the cognizance of the cag aviation is where the navy and marines share the most common ground since aircrews are guided in their use of aircraft by standard procedures outlined in series of publications known as natops manuals.citation needed united states coast guardedit the united states coast guard in its peacetime role with the department of homeland security fulfills its law enforcement and rescue role in the maritime environment it provides law enforcement detachments ledets to navy vessels where they perform arrests and other law enforcement duties during naval boarding and interdiction missions in times of war the coast guard operates as a service in the navy.54 at other times coast guard port security units are sent overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets the coast guard also jointly staffs the navy's naval coastal warfare groups and squadrons the latter of which were known as harbor defense commands until late-2004 which oversee defense efforts in foreign littoral combat and inshore areas.citation needed personneledit the united states navy has nearly 500000 personnel approximately a quarter of whom are in ready reserve of those on active duty more than eighty percent are enlisted sailors and around fifteen percent are commissioned officers the rest are midshipmen of the united states naval academy and midshipmen of the naval reserve officer training corps at over 180 universities around the country and officer candidates at the navy's officer candidate school.2 enlisted sailors complete basic military training at boot camp and then are sent to complete training for their individual careers.55 sailors prove they have mastered skills and deserve responsibilities by completing personnel qualification standards pqs tasks and examinations among the most important is the warfare qualification which denotes a journeyman level of capability in surface warfare aviation warfare information dominance warfare naval aircrew special warfare seabee warfare submarine warfare or expeditionary warfare many qualifications are denoted on a sailor's uniform with u.s navy badges and insignia uniformsedit the uniforms of the u.s navy have evolved gradually since the first uniform regulations for officers were issued in 1802 on the formation of the navy department the predominant colors of u.s navy uniforms are navy blue and white u.s navy uniforms were based on royal navy uniforms of the time and have tended to follow that template.56 commissioned officersedit the commissioned officer ranks of the u.s navy are divided into three categories junior officers senior officers and flag officers junior officers are those officers in pay grades o-1 to o-4 while senior officers are those in pay grades o-5 and o-6 and flag officers are those in pay grades of o-7 and above.57 commissioned warrant officer ranksedit enlistededit sailors in pay grades e-1 through e-3 are considered to be in apprenticeships.58 they are divided into five definable groups with colored group rate marks designating the group to which they belong seaman fireman airman constructionman and hospitalman e-4 to e-6 are non-commissioned officers ncos and are specifically called petty officers in the navy.59 petty officers perform not only the duties of their specific career field but also serve as leaders to junior enlisted personnel e-7 to e-9 are still considered petty officers but are considered a separate community within the navy they have separate berthing and dining facilities where feasible wear separate uniforms and perform separate duties after attaining the rate of master chief petty officer a service member may choose to further his or her career by becoming a command master chief petty officer cmc a cmc is considered to be the senior-most enlisted service member within a command and is the special assistant to the commanding officer in all matters pertaining to the health welfare job satisfaction morale utilization advancement and training of the command's enlisted personnel.6061 cmcs can be command level within a single unit such as a ship or shore station fleet level squadrons consisting of multiple operational units headed by a flag officer or commodore or force level consisting of a separate community within the navy such as subsurface air reserves.62 cmc insignia are similar to the insignia for master chief except that the rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating i.e. mmcm to cmdcm the stars for command master chief are silver while stars for fleet or force master chief are gold additionally cmcs wear a badge worn on their left breast pocket denoting their title command/fleet/force.6163 badges of the united states navyedit insignia and badges of the united states navy are military badges issued by the united states department of the navy to naval service members who achieve certain qualifications and accomplishments while serving on both active and reserve duty in the united states navy most naval aviation insignia are also permitted for wear on uniforms of the united states marine corps as described in chapter 5 of u.s navy uniform regulations64 badges are categorized as breast insignia usually worn immediately above and below ribbons and identification badges usually worn at breast pocket level.65 breast insignia are further divided between command and warfare and other qualification.66 insignia come in the form of metal pin-on devices worn on formal uniforms and embroidered tape strips worn on work uniforms for the purpose of this article the general term insignia shall be used to describe both as it is done in navy uniform regulations the term badge although used ambiguously in other military branches and in informal speak to describe any pin patch or tab is exclusive to identification badges67 and authorized marksmanship awards68 according to the language in navy uniform regulations chapter 5 below are just a few of the many badges maintained by the navy the rest can be seen in the article cited at the top of this section naval aviator badge submarine officer and enlisted surface warfare officer insignia basesedit the size complexity and international presence of the united states navy requires a large number of navy installations to support its operations while the majority of bases are located inside the united states itself the navy maintains a significant number of facilities abroad either in u.s.-controlled territories or in foreign countries under a status of forces agreement sofa.citation needed eastern united statesedit there is also a naval base in

aircraft carriers in emergencies.71 its naval air station was deactivated72 in 1995 and its flight activities transferred to nearby andersen air force base puerto rico in the caribbean formerly housed ns roosevelt roads which was shut down in 2004 shortly after the controversial closure of the live ordnance training area on nearby vieques island.2 foreign countriesedit the largest overseas base is

in cuba is the oldest overseas facility and has become known in recent years as the location of a detention camp for suspected al-qaeda operatives.74 equipmentedit shipsedit the names of commissioned ships of the u.s navy are prefixed with the letters uss designating united states ship.75 non-commissioned civilian-manned vessels of the navy have names that begin with usns standing for united states naval ship the names of ships are officially selected by the secretary of the navy often to honor important people or places.76 additionally each ship is given a letter-based hull classification symbol for example cvn or ddg to indicate the vessel's type and number all ships in the navy inventory are placed in the naval vessel register which is part of the navy list required by article 29 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea.dubious  discuss the register tracks data such as the current status of a ship the date of its commissioning and the date of its decommissioning vessels that are removed from the register prior to disposal are said to be stricken from the register the navy also maintains a reserve fleet of inactive vessels that are maintained for reactivation in times of need the u.s navy was one of the first to install nuclear reactors aboard naval vessels;77 today nuclear energy powers all active u.s aircraft carriers and submarines in the case of the nimitz-class carrier two naval reactors give the ship almost unlimited range and provide enough electrical energy to power a city of 100000 people.78 the u.s navy previously operated nuclear-powered cruisers but all have been decommissioned the u.s navy had identified a need for 313 combat ships in early 2010s but under its plans at the time could only afford 232 to 243.79 in march 2014 the navy started counting self-deployable support ships such as minesweepers surveillance craft and tugs in the battle fleet in order to reach a count of 272 as of october 20168081 and it includes ships that have been put in shrink wrap.82 aircraft carriersedit an aircraft carrier is typically deployed along with a host of additional vessels forming a carrier strike group the supporting ships which usually include three or four aegis-equipped cruisers and destroyers a frigate and two attack submarines are tasked with protecting the carrier from air missile sea and undersea threats as well as providing additional strike capabilities themselves ready logistics support for the group is provided by a combined ammunition oiler and supply ship modern carriers are named after american admirals and politicians usually presidents amphibious warfare vesselsedit amphibious assault ships are the centerpieces of us amphibious warfare and fulfill the same power projection role as aircraft carriers except that their striking force centers on land forces instead of aircraft they deliver command coordinate and fully support all elements of a 2200-strong marine expeditionary unit in an amphibious assault using both air and amphibious vehicles resembling small aircraft carriers amphibious assault ships are capable of v/stol stovl vtol tiltrotor and rotary wing aircraft operations they also contain a well deck to support the use of landing craft air cushion lcac and other amphibious assault watercraft recently amphibious assault ships have begun to be deployed as the core of an expeditionary strike group which usually consists of an additional amphibious transport dock and dock landing ship for amphibious warfare and an aegis-equipped cruiser and destroyer frigate and attack submarine for group defense amphibious assault ships are typically named after world war ii aircraft carriers.citation needed the dock landing ship is a medium amphibious transport that is designed specifically to support and operate lcacs though it is able to operate other amphibious assault vehicles in the united states inventory as well dock landing ships are normally deployed as a component of an expeditionary strike group's amphibious assault contingent operating as a secondary launch platform for lcacs all dock landing ships are named after cities or important places in u.s and u.s naval history.citation needed cruisersedit cruisers are large surface combat vessels that conduct anti-air/anti-missile warfare surface warfare anti-submarine warfare and strike operations independently or as members of a larger task force modern guided missile cruisers were developed out of a need to counter the anti-ship missile threat facing the united states navy this led to the development of the an/spy-1 phased array radar and the standard missile with the aegis combat system coordinating the two ticonderoga-class cruisers were the first to be equipped with aegis and were put to use primarily as anti-air and anti-missile defense in a battle force protection role later developments of vertical launch systems and the tomahawk missile gave cruisers additional long-range land and sea strike capability making them capable of both offensive and defensive battle operations the ticonderoga class is the only active class of cruiser all cruisers in this class are named after battles.citation needed destroyersedit destroyers are multi-mission medium surface ships capable of sustained performance in anti-air anti-submarine anti-ship and offensive strike operations like cruisers guided missile destroyers are primarily focused on surface strikes using tomahawk missiles and fleet defense through aegis and the standard missile destroyers additionally specialize in anti-submarine warfare and are equipped with vla rockets and lamps mk iii sea hawk helicopters to deal with underwater threats when deployed with a carrier strike group or expeditionary strike group destroyers and their fellow aegis-equipped cruisers are primarily tasked with defending the fleet while providing secondary strike capabilities with very few exceptions destroyers are named after u.s navy marine corps and coast guard heroes.citation needed frigates and littoral combat shipsedit modern u.s frigates mainly perform anti-submarine warfare for carrier and expeditionary strike groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and merchant shipping they are designed to protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments using torpedoes and lamps helicopters independently frigates are able to conduct counterdrug missions and other maritime interception operations as in the case of destroyers frigates are named after u.s navy marine corps and coast guard heroes as of autumn 2015 the u.s navy has retired its most recent class of frigates and expects that by 2020 the littoral combat ships lcs will assume many of the duties the frigate had with the fleet the lcs is a class of relatively small surface vessels intended for operations in the littoral zone close to shore it was envisioned to be a networked agile stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals they have the capabilities of a small assault transport including a flight deck and hangar for housing two helicopters a stern ramp for operating small boats and the cargo volume and payload to deliver a small assault force with fighting vehicles to a roll-on/roll-off port facility the ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles including anti-submarine warfare mine countermeasures anti-surface warfare intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance homeland defense maritime intercept special operations and logistics all by swapping mission-specific modules as needed the lcs program is still relatively new as of 2015 with only a few active ships but the navy has announced plans for up to 32 ships see list of littoral combat ships the navy has announced that a further 20 vessels to be built after that will be redesignated as 'frigates'.85 mine countermeasures shipsedit mine countermeasures vessels are a combination of minehunters a naval vessel that actively detects and destroys individual naval mines and minesweepers which clear mined areas as a whole without prior detection of the mines the navy has approximately a dozen of these in active service but the mine countermeasure mcm role is also being assumed by the incoming classes of littoral combat ships mcm vessels have mostly legacy names of previous us navy ships especially wwii-era minesweepers.citation needed patrol boatsedit a patrol boat is a relatively small naval vessel generally designed for coastal defense duties there have been many designs for patrol boats though the navy currently only has a single class they may be operated by a nation's navy or coast guard and may be intended for marine blue water and/or estuarine or river brown water environments the navy has approximately a dozen in active service which are mainly used in the littoral regions of the persian gulf but have also been used for home port patrols and drug interdiction missions the navy's current class of patrol boats have names based on weather phenomena.citation needed submarinesedit all current and planned u.s navy submarines are nuclear-powered as only nuclear propulsion allows for the combination of stealth and long duration high-speed sustained underwater movement that makes modern nuclear submarines so vital to a modern blue-water navy the u.s navy operates three types ballistic missile submarines guided missile submarines and attack submarines u.s navy nuclear ballistic missile submarines carry the stealthiest leg of the u.s strategic triad the other legs are the land-based u.s strategic missile force and the air-based u.s strategic bomber force these submarines have only one mission to carry and if called upon to launch the trident nuclear missile the primary missions of attack and guided missile submarines in the u.s navy are peacetime engagement surveillance and intelligence special operations precision strikes and control of the seas.86 to these attack submarines also add the battlegroup operations mission attack and guided missile submarines have several tactical missions including sinking ships and other subs launching cruise missiles gathering intelligence and assisting in special operations.citation needed aircraftedit carrier-based aircraft are able to strike air sea and land targets far from a carrier strike group while protecting friendly forces from enemy aircraft ships and submarines in peacetime aircraft's ability to project the threat of sustained attack from a mobile platform on the seas gives united states leaders significant diplomatic and crisis-management options aircraft additionally provide logistics support to maintain the navy's readiness and through helicopters supply platforms with which to conduct search and rescue special operations anti-submarine warfare asw and anti-surface warfare asuw.citation needed the aircraft investment plan sees naval aviation growing from 30 percent of current aviation forces to half of all procurement funding over the next three decades.90 weaponsedit current u.s navy shipboard weapons systems are almost entirely focused on missiles both as a weapon and as a threat in an offensive role missiles are intended to strike targets at long distances with accuracy and precision because they are unmanned weapons missiles allow for attacks on heavily defended targets without risk to human pilots land strikes are the domain of the bgm-109 tomahawk which was first deployed in the 1980s and is continually being updated to increase its capabilities for anti-ship strikes the navy's dedicated missile is the harpoon missile to defend against enemy missile attack the navy operates a number of systems that are all coordinated by the aegis combat system medium-long range defense is provided by the standard missile 2 which has been deployed since the 1980s the standard missile doubles as the primary shipboard anti-aircraft weapon and is undergoing development for use in theater ballistic missile defense short range defense against missiles is provided by the phalanx ciws and the more recently developed rim-162 evolved sea sparrow missile in addition to missiles the navy employs mark 46 and mark 50 torpedoes and various types of naval mines.citation needed naval fixed-wing aircraft employ much of the same weapons as the united states air force for both air-to-air and air-to-surface combat air engagements are handled by the heat-seeking sidewinder and the radar guided amraam missiles along with the m61 vulcan cannon for close range dogfighting for surface strikes navy aircraft utilize a combination of missiles smart bombs and dumb bombs on the list of available missiles are the maverick slam-er and jsow smart bombs include the gps-guided jdam and the laser-guided paveway series unguided munitions such as dumb bombs and cluster bombs make up the rest of the weapons deployed by fixed-wing aircraft.citation needed rotary aircraft weapons are focused on anti-submarine warfare asw and light to medium surface engagements to combat submarines helicopters use mark 46 and mark 50 torpedoes against small watercraft they utilize hellfire and penguin air to surface missiles helicopters also employ various types of mounted anti-personnel machine guns including the m60 m240 gau-16/a and gau-17/a.citation needed nuclear weapons in the u.s navy arsenal are deployed through ballistic missile submarines and aircraft the ohio-class submarine carries the latest iteration of the trident

rotational symmetry rotational symmetry also known as radial symmetry in biology is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn an object's degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks the same  contents  formal treatmentedit formally the rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in m-dimensional euclidean space rotations are direct isometries i.e. isometries preserving orientation therefore a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of e+m see euclidean group symmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations so space is homogeneous and the symmetry group is the whole em with the modified notion of symmetry for vector fields the symmetry group can also be e+m in another meaning of the word the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within e+n the group of direct isometries in other words the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries for chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group laws of physics are so3-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space because of noether's theorem rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law discrete rotational symmetryedit examples without additional reflection symmetry cn is the rotation group of a regular n-sided polygon in 2d and of a regular n-sided pyramid in 3d a typical 3d object with rotational symmetry possibly also with perpendicular axes but no mirror symmetry is a propeller examplesedit multiple symmetry axes through the same pointedit for discrete symmetry with multiple symmetry axes through the same point there are the following possibilities in the case of the platonic solids the 2-fold axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges and the number of them is half the number of edges the other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces except in the case of the tetrahedron where the 3-fold axes are each through one vertex and the center of one face rotational symmetry with respect to any angleedit rotational symmetry with respect to any angle is in two dimensions circular symmetry the fundamental domain is a half-line in three dimensions we can distinguish cylindrical symmetry and spherical symmetry no change when rotating about one axis or for any rotation that is no dependence on the angle using cylindrical coordinates and no dependence on either angle using spherical coordinates the fundamental domain is a half-plane through the axis and a radial half-line respectively axisymmetric or axisymmetrical are adjectives which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry or axisymmetry an example of approximate spherical symmetry is the earth with respect to density and other physical and chemical properties in 4d continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2d rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane about the point of intersection an object can also have rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes e.g if it is the cartesian product of two rotationally symmetry 2d figures as in the case of e.g the duocylinder and various regular duoprisms rotational symmetry with translational symmetryedit 2-fold rotational symmetry together with single translational symmetry is one of the frieze groups there are two rotocenters per primitive cell together with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the following wallpaper groups with axes per primitive cell scaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor therefore the number of 2- 3- 4- and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4 3 2 and 1 respectively again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold etc see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

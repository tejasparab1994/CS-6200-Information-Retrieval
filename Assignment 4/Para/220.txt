advection in physics engineering and earth sciences advection is the transport of a substance by bulk motion the properties of that substance are carried with it generally the majority of the advected substance is a fluid the properties that are carried with the advected substance are conserved properties such as energy an example of advection is the transport of pollutants or silt in a river by bulk water flow downstream another commonly advected quantity is energy or enthalpy here the fluid may be any material that contains thermal energy such as water or air in general any substance or conserved extensive quantity can be advected by a fluid that can hold or contain the quantity or substance during advection a fluid transports some conserved quantity or material via bulk motion the fluid's motion is described mathematically as a vector field and the transported material is described by a scalar field showing its distribution over space advection requires currents in the fluid and so cannot happen in rigid solids it does not include transport of substances by molecular diffusion advection is sometimes confused with the more encompassing process of convection which is the combination of advective transport and diffusive transport in meteorology and physical oceanography advection often refers to the transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean such as heat humidity see moisture or salinity advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds and the precipitation of water from clouds as part of the hydrological cycle  contents  distinction between advection and convectionedit the term advection sometimes serves as a synonym for convection but technically convection covers the sum of transport both by diffusion and by advection advective transport describes the movement of some quantity via the bulk flow of a fluid as in a river or pipeline.12 meteorologyedit in meteorology and physical oceanography advection often refers to the horizontal transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean such as heat humidity or salinity and convection generally refers to vertical transport vertical advection advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds terrain-forced convection and the precipitation of water from clouds as part of the hydrological cycle other quantitiesedit the advection equation also applies if the quantity being advected is represented by a probability density function at each point although accounting for diffusion is more difficult.citation needed mathematics of advectionedit the advection equation is the partial differential equation that governs the motion of a conserved scalar field as it is advected by a known velocity vector field it is derived using the scalar field's conservation law together with gauss's theorem and taking the infinitesimal limit one easily visualized example of advection is the transport of ink dumped into a river as the river flows ink will move downstream in a pulse via advection as the water's movement itself transports the ink if added to a lake without significant bulk water flow the ink would simply disperse outwards from its source in a diffusive manner which is not advection note that as it moves downstream the pulse of ink will also spread via diffusion the sum of these processes is called convection the advection equationedit in cartesian coordinates the advection operator is whereuuxuyuzdisplaystyle mathbf u =u_xu_yu_z is the velocity field anddisplaystyle nabla  is the del operator note that cartesian coordinates are used here wheredisplaystyle nabla cdot  is the divergence operator and againudisplaystyle mathbf u  is the velocity vector field frequently it is assumed that the flow is incompressible that is the velocity field satisfies andudisplaystyle mathbf u  is said to be solenoidal if this is so the above equation can be rewritten as in particular if the flow is steady then if a vector quantityadisplaystyle mathbf a  such as a magnetic field is being advected by the solenoidal velocity fieldudisplaystyle mathbf u  the advection equation above becomes solving the equationedit the advection equation is not simple to solve numerically the system is a hyperbolic partial differential equation and interest typically centers on discontinuous shock solutions which are notoriously difficult for numerical schemes to handle even with one space dimension and a constant velocity field the system remains difficult to simulate the equation becomes treatment of the advection operator in the incompressible navier stokes equationsedit according to zang3 numerical simulation can be aided by considering the skew symmetric form for the advection operator where andudisplaystyle mathbf u  is the same as above since skew symmetry implies only imaginary eigenvalues this form reduces the blow up and spectral blocking often experienced in numerical solutions with sharp discontinuities see boyd4 using vector calculus identities these operators can also be expressed in other ways available in more software packages for more coordinate systems this form also makes visible that the skew symmetric operator introduces error when the velocity field diverges solving the advection equation by numerical methods is very challenging and there is a large scientific literature about this see

louisiana as of 20101 louisianaa is a state in the southeastern region of the united states it is the 31st in size and the 25th most populous of the 50 united states louisiana's capital is baton rouge and its largest city is new orleans it is the only state in the u.s with political subdivisions termed parishes which are the local government's equivalent to counties the largest parish by population is east baton rouge parish and the largest by total area is plaquemines louisiana is bordered by arkansas to the north mississippi to the east texas to the west and the gulf of mexico to the south much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the mississippi river leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp.10 these contain a rich southern biota typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets there are also many species of tree frogs and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish in more elevated areas fire is a natural process in the landscape and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas these support an exceptionally large number of plant species including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants.10 louisiana has more native american tribes than any other southern state including four that are federally recognized ten that are state recognized and four that have not yet received recognition.11 some louisiana urban environments have a multicultural multilingual heritage being so strongly influenced by a mixture of 18th-century french spanish native american and african cultures that they are considered to be exceptional in the us before the american purchase of the territory in 1803 the current louisiana state had been both a french colony and for a brief period a spanish one in addition colonists imported numerous african people as slaves in the 18th century many came from peoples of the same region of west africa thus concentrating their culture in the post-civil war environment anglo-americans increased the pressure for anglicization and in 1921 english was for a time made the sole language of instruction in louisiana schools before a policy of multilingualism was revived in 1974.1213 there has never been an official language in louisiana and the state constitution enumerates the right of the people to preserve foster and promote their respective historic linguistic and cultural origins whether english french spanish or otherwise.12  contents  etymologyedit geologyedit the gulf of mexico did not exist 250 million years ago when there was but one supercontinent pangea as pangea split apart the atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico opened louisiana slowly developed over millions of years from water into land and from north to south.10 the oldest rocks are exposed in the north in areas such as the kisatchie national forest the oldest rocks date back to the early cenozoic era some 60 million years ago the history of the formation of these rocks can be found in d spearing's roadside geology of louisiana.15 the youngest parts of the state were formed during the last 12000 years as successive deltas of the mississippi river the maringouin teche st bernard lafourche the modern mississippi and now the atchafalaya.16 the sediments were carried from north to south by the mississippi river in between the tertiary rocks of the north and the relatively new sediments along the coast is a vast belt known as the pleistocene terraces their age and distribution can be largely related to the rise and fall of sea levels during past ice ages in general the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter.17 salt domes are also found in louisiana their origin can be traced back to the early gulf of mexico when the shallow ocean had high rates of evaporation there are several hundred salt domes in the state one of the most familiar is avery island.18 salt domes are important not only as a source of salt they also serve as underground traps for oil and gas.19 geographyedit louisiana is bordered to the west by texas to the north by arkansas to the east by the state of mississippi and to the south by the gulf of mexico the surface of the state may properly be divided into two parts the uplands of the north and the alluvial along the coast the southern coast of louisiana in the united states is among the fastest-disappearing areas in the world this has largely resulted from human mismanagement of the coast see wetlands of louisiana at one time the land was added to when spring floods from the mississippi river added sediment and stimulated marsh growth the land is now shrinking there are multiple causes.2223 artificial levees block spring flood water that would bring fresh water and sediment to marshes swamps have been extensively logged leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland where it damages swamps and marshes rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day there are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage including restoring natural floods from the mississippi without such restoration coastal communities will continue to disappear.24 and as the communities disappear more and more people are leaving the region.25 since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry climateedit louisiana is often affected by tropical cyclones and is very vulnerable to strikes by major hurricanes particularly the lowlands around and in the new orleans area the unique geography of the region with the many bayous marshes and inlets can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes the area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms especially in the summer.27 the entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year more than any other state except florida louisiana averages 27 tornadoes annually the entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state tornadoes are more common from january to march in the southern part of the state and from february through march in the northern part of the state.27 hurricanes since 1950edit government-owned landedit owing to its location and geology the state has high biological diversity some vital areas such as southwestern prairie have experienced a loss in excess of 98 percent the pine flatwoods are also at great risk mostly from fire suppression and urban sprawl.10 there is not yet a properly organized system of natural areas to represent and protect louisiana's biological diversity such a system would consist of a protected system of core areas linked by biological corridors such as florida is planning.37 louisiana contains a number of areas which to varying degrees prevent people from using them.38 in addition to national park service areas and a united states national forest louisiana operates a system of state parks state historic sites one state preservation area one state forest and many wildlife management areas one of louisiana's largest government-owned areas is kisatchie national forest it is some 600000 acres in area more than half of which is flatwoods vegetation which supports many rare plant and animal species.10 these include the louisiana pine snake and red-cockaded woodpecker the system of government-owned cypress swamps around lake pontchartrain is another large area with southern wetland species including egrets alligators and sturgeon at least 12 core areas would be needed to build a protected areas system for the state these would range from southwestern prairies to the pearl river floodplain in the east to the mississippi river alluvial swamps in the north.10 national park serviceedit historic or scenic areas managed protected or otherwise recognized by the national park service include us forest

waterway is an important means of transporting commercial goods such as petroleum and petroleum products agricultural produce building materials and manufactured goods in 2011 louisiana ranked among the five deadliest states for debris/litter-caused vehicle accidents per total number of registered vehicles and population size figures derived from40 the ntsha show at least 25 persons in louisiana were killed per year in motor vehicle collisions with non-fixed objects including debris dumped litter animals and their carcasses historyedit pre-colonial historyedit nearly 2000 years later poverty point the largest and best-known late archaic site in the state was built modern-day epps developed near it the poverty point culture may have reached its peak around 1500 bce making it the first complex culture and possibly the first tribal culture in north america.43 it lasted until approximately 700 bce the poverty point culture was followed by the tchefuncte and lake cormorant cultures of the tchula period local manifestations of early woodland period the tchefuncte culture were the first people in louisiana to make large amounts of pottery.44 these cultures lasted until 200 ce the middle woodland period starts in louisiana with the marksville culture in the southern and eastern part of the state45 and the fourche maline culture in the northwestern part of the state the marksville culture takes its name from the marksville prehistoric indian site in avoyelles parish these cultures were contemporaneous with the hopewell cultures of ohio and illinois and participated in the hopewell exchange network trade with peoples to the southwest brought the bow and arrow.46 the first burial mounds were built at this time.47 political power begins to be consolidated as the first platform mounds at ritual centers are constructed for the developing hereditary political and religious leadership.47 by 400 ce in the southern part of the state the late woodland period had begun with the baytown culture population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity many coles creek sites were erected over earlier woodland period mortuary mounds scholars have speculated that emerging elites were symbolically and physically appropriating dead ancestors to emphasize and project their own authority.48 the mississippian period in louisiana was when plaquemine and the caddoan mississippian cultures developed and extensive maize agriculture was adopted the plaquemine culture in the lower mississippi river valley in western mississippi and eastern louisiana began in 1200 ce and continued to about 1400 ce good examples of this culture are the medora site in west baton rouge parish and the emerald mound winterville and holly bluff sites in mississippi.49 plaquemine culture was contemporaneous with the middle mississippian culture represented by the primary settlement the cahokia site near st louis missouri this group is considered ancestral to the natchez and taensa peoples.50 by 1000 ce in the northwestern part of the state the fourche maline culture had evolved into the caddoan mississippian culture the caddoan mississippians covered a large territory including what is now eastern oklahoma western arkansas northeast texas and northwest louisiana archeological evidence has demonstrated that the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory to the present the caddo and related caddo language speakers in prehistoric times and at first european contact were the direct ancestors of the modern caddo nation of oklahoma of today.51 many current place names in the state including atchafalaya natchitouches now spelled natchitoches caddo houma tangipahoa and avoyel as avoyelles are transliterations of those used in various native american languages exploration and colonization by europeansedit in the late 17th century french and french canadian expeditions which included sovereign religious and commercial aims established a foothold on the mississippi river and gulf coast with its first settlements france laid claim to a vast region of north america and set out to establish a commercial empire and french nation stretching from the gulf of mexico to canada the settlement of natchitoches along the red river in present-day northwest louisiana was established in 1714 by louis juchereau de st denis making it the oldest permanent european settlement in the modern state of louisiana the french settlement had two purposes to establish trade with the spanish in texas via the old san antonio road and to deter spanish advances into louisiana the settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river over time planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town this became a pattern repeated in new orleans and other places louisiana's french settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts concentrated along the banks of the mississippi and its major tributaries from louisiana to as far north as the region called the illinois country around present-day st louis missouri initially mobile and then biloxi functioned as the capital of the colony recognizing the importance of the mississippi river to trade and military interests france made new orleans the seat of civilian and military authority south of the great lakes in 1722 from then until the united states acquired the territory in the louisiana purchase of 1803 france and spain jockeyed for control of new orleans and the lands west of the mississippi in the 1720s german immigrants settled along the mississippi river in a region referred to as the german coast france ceded most of its territory to the east of the mississippi to great britain in 1763 in the aftermath of britain's victory in the seven years war generally referred to in north america as the french and indian war the rest of louisiana including the area around new orleans and the parishes around lake pontchartrain had become a colony of spain by the treaty of fontainebleau 1762 although the transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade in 1765 during spanish rule several thousand french-speaking refugees from the region of acadia now nova scotia new brunswick and prince edward island canada made their way to louisiana after having been expelled from their homelands by the british during the french and indian war they settled chiefly in the southwestern louisiana region now called acadiana the spanish eager to gain more catholic settlers welcomed the acadian refugees the ancestors of louisiana's cajuns in 1800 france's napoleon bonaparte reacquired louisiana from spain in the treaty of san ildefonso an arrangement kept secret for two years expansion of slaveryedit jean-baptiste le moyne sieur de bienville brought the first two african slaves to louisiana in 1708 transporting them from a french colony in the west indies in 1709 french financier antoine crozat obtained a monopoly of commerce in la louisiane which extended from the gulf of mexico to what is now illinois that concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from africa every year the british historian hugh thomas wrote.54 physical conditions including disease were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves starting in 1719 traders began to import slaves in higher numbers two french ships the du maine and the aurore arrived in new orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from africa previous slaves in louisiana had been transported from french colonies in the west indies by the end of 1721 new orleans counted 1256 inhabitants of whom about half were slaves in 1724 the french government issued a law called the code noir black code in english which regulated the interaction of whites blancs and blacks noirs in its colony of louisiana55 which was much larger than the current state of louisiana the law consisted of fifty-seven articles which regulated religion in the colony outlawed interracial marriages those between people of different skin color the varying shades of which were also defined by law restricted manumission outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves the main intent of the french government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there in practice the code noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies for example and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally article ii of the code noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion roman catholicism sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves on days off slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves during the 1740s economic crisis in the colony owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property they began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence article vi of the code noir forbade mixed marriages forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners overseers or other slaves on balance the code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern thirteen colonies the louisiana black code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.56 fugitive slaves called maroons could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements the word maroon comes from the french marron it means feral or fugitive in the late 18th century the last spanish governor of the louisiana territory wrote truly it is impossible for lower louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.57 when the united states purchased louisiana in 1803 it was soon accepted that enslaved africans could be brought to louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring mississippi though it violated u.s law to do so.57 despite demands by united states rep james hillhouse and by the pamphleteer thomas paine to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory57 slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor at the start of the 19th century louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves compared to saint-domingue and the west indies it soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations william c c claiborne louisiana's first united states governor said that african slave labor was needed because white laborers cannot be had in this unhealthy climate.58 hugh thomas wrote that claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the african slave trade which the us and great britain adopted in 1808 the united states continued to protect the domestic slave trade including the coastwise trade  the transport of slaves by ship along the atlantic coast and to new orleans and other gulf ports by 1840 new orleans had the biggest slave market in the united states which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state new orleans had become one of the wealthiest cities and the third largest city in the nation.59 the ban on the african slave trade and importation of slaves had increased demand in the domestic market during the decades after the american revolutionary war more than one million enslaved african americans underwent forced migration from the upper south to the deep south two thirds of them in the slave trade others were transported by their owners as slaveholders moved west for new lands.6061 with changing agriculture in the upper south as planters shifted from tobacco to less labor-intensive mixed agriculture planters had excess laborers many sold slaves to traders to take to the deep south slaves were driven by traders overland from the upper south or transported to new orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the coastwise slave trade after sales in new orleans steamboats operating on the mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at natchez and memphis as the deep south was developed for cotton and sugar in the first half of the nineteenth century demand for slaves increased this resulted in a massive forced migration through the slave trade of more than one million african americans from the upper south to the deep south many traders brought slaves to new orleans for domestic sale and by 1840 new orleans had the largest slave market in the country was the third-largest city and was one of the wealthiest cities haitian migration and influenceedit spanish occupation of louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800 beginning in the 1790s waves of immigration took place from saint-domingue following a slave rebellion that started in 1791 over the next decade thousands of migrants landed in louisiana from the island including ethnic europeans free people of color and african slaves some of the latter brought in by each free group they greatly increased the french-speaking population in new orleans and louisiana as well as the number of africans and the slaves reinforced african culture in the city the process of gaining independence in saint-domingue was complex but uprisings continued in 1803 france pulled out its surviving troops from the island having suffered the loss of two-thirds sent to the island two years before mostly to yellow fever in 1804 haiti the second republic in the western hemisphere proclaimed its independence achieved by slave leaders.62 purchase by the united states 1803edit when the united states won its independence from great britain in 1783 one of its major concerns was having a european power on its western boundary and the need for unrestricted access to the mississippi river as american settlers pushed west they found that the appalachian mountains provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward the easiest way to ship produce was to use a flatboat to float it down the ohio and mississippi rivers to the port of new orleans from whence goods could be put on ocean-going vessels the problem with this route was that the spanish owned both sides of the mississippi below natchez napoleon's ambitions in louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the caribbean sugar trade by the terms of the treaty of amiens of 1802 great britain returned ownership of the islands of martinique and guadaloupe to the french napoleon looked upon louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands and as a buffer to u.s settlement in october 1801 he sent a large military force to take back saint-domingue then under control of toussaint louverture after a slave rebellion when the army led by napoleon's brother-in-law leclerc was defeated napoleon decided to sell louisiana thomas jefferson third president of the united states was disturbed by napoleon's plans to re-establish french colonies in america with the possession of new orleans napoleon could close the mississippi to u.s commerce at any time jefferson authorized robert r livingston u.s minister to france to negotiate for the purchase of the city of new orleans portions of the east bank of the mississippi and free navigation of the river for u.s commerce livingston was authorized to pay up to $2 million an official transfer of louisiana to french ownership had not yet taken place and napoleon's deal with the spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier on october 18 1802 however juan ventura morales acting intendant of louisiana made public the intention of spain to revoke the right of deposit at new orleans for all cargo from the united states the closure of this vital port to the united states caused anger and consternation commerce in the west was virtually blockaded historians believe that the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the americans particularly smuggling and not by french intrigues as was believed at the time president jefferson ignored public pressure for war with france and appointed james monroe a special envoy to napoleon to assist in obtaining new orleans for the united states jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10 million when news of the purchase reached the united states jefferson was surprised he had authorized the expenditure of $10 million for a port city and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a land package which would double the size of the country jefferson's political opponents in the federalist party argued the louisiana purchase was a worthless desert66 and that the constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or negotiating treaties without the consent of the senate what really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the louisiana territory strengthening western and southern interests in congress and further reducing the influence of new england federalists in national affairs president jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion and held firm in his support for the treaty despite federalist objections the u.s senate ratified the louisiana treaty on october 20 1803 by statute enacted on october 31 1803 president thomas jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by france and provide for initial governance.67 a transfer ceremony was held in new orleans on november 29 1803 since the louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the french the spanish took down their flag and the french raised theirs the following day general james wilkinson accepted possession of new orleans for the united states a similar ceremony was held in st louis on march 9 1804 when a french tricolor was raised near the river replacing the spanish national flag the following day captain amos stoddard of the first u.s artillery marched his troops into town and had the american flag run up the fort's flagpole the louisiana territory was officially transferred to the united states government represented by meriwether lewis the louisiana territory purchased for less than 3 cents an acre doubled the size of the united states overnight without a war or the loss of a single american life and set a precedent for the purchase of territory it opened the way for the eventual expansion of the united states across the continent to the pacific shortly after the united states took possession the area was divided into two territories along the 33rd parallel north on march 26 1804 thereby organizing the territory of orleans to the south and the district of louisiana subsequently formed as the louisiana territory to the north.68 statehood 1812edit louisiana became the eighteenth u.s state on april 30 1812 the territory of orleans became the state of louisiana and the louisiana territory was simultaneously renamed the missouri territory.69 an area known as the florida parishes was soon annexed into the state of louisiana on april 14 1812.70 according to the 1860 census 331726 people were enslaved nearly 47 of the state's total population of 708002.71 the strong economic interest of elite whites in maintaining the slave society contributed to louisiana's decision to secede from the union in january 26 1861.72 it followed other southern states in seceding after the election of abraham lincoln as president of the united states louisiana's secession was announced on january 26 1861 and it became part of the confederate states of america the state was quickly defeated in the civil war a result of union strategy to cut the confederacy in two by seizing the mississippi federal troops captured new orleans on april 25 1862 because a large part of the population had union sympathies or compatible commercial interests the federal government took the unusual step of designating the areas of louisiana under federal control as a state within the union with its own elected representatives to the u.s congress.citation needed us troops stationed in new orleans complained of insults by its women following the civil war and emancipation of slaves violence rose in the south as the war was carried on by insurgent private and paramilitary groups initially state legislatures were dominated by former confederates who passed black codes to regulate freedmen and generally refused to give the vote they refused to extend voting rights to african americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property as in new orleans. following the memphis riots of 1866 and the new orleans riot the same year the fourteenth amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen congress passed the reconstruction act establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst including louisiana it was grouped with texas in what was administered as the fifth military district african americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law both freedmen and people of color who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education family stability and jobs at the same time there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market white insurgents mobilized to enforce white supremacy first in ku klux klan chapters by 1877 when federal forces were withdrawn white democrats in louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures often by paramilitary groups such as the white league which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence following mississippi's example in 1890 in 1898 the white democratic planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised blacks and people of color by raising barriers to voter registration such as poll taxes residency requirements and literacy tests the effect was immediate and long lasting in 1896 there were 130334 black voters on the rolls and about the same number of white voters in proportion to the state population which was evenly divided.73 the state population in 1900 was 47 african-american a total of 652013 citizens many in new orleans were descendants of creoles of color the sizeable population of free people of color before the civil war.74 by 1900 two years after the new constitution only 5320 black voters were registered in the state because of disfranchisement by 1910 there were only 730 black voters less than 0.5 percent of eligible african-american men despite advances in education and literacy among blacks and people of color.75 blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries white democrats had established one-party democratic rule which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after congressional passage of the 1965 voting rights act provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote in the early decades of the 20th century thousands of african americans left louisiana in the great migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education and to escape jim crow society and lynchings the boll weevil infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs the mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers beginning in the 1940s blacks went west to california for jobs in its expanding defense industries.76 during some of the great depression louisiana was led by governor huey long he was elected to office on populist appeal his public works projects provided thousands of jobs to people in need and he supported education and increased suffrage for poor whites but long was criticized for his allegedly demogogic and autocratic style he extended patronage control through every branch of louisiana's state government especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state long's rule ended abruptly when the governor was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935 mobilization for world war ii created jobs in the state thousands of other workers black and white alike migrated to california for better jobs in its burgeoning defense industry many african americans left the state in the second great migration from the 1940s through the 1960s the mechanization of agriculture in the 1930s had sharply cut the need for laborers they sought skilled jobs in the defense industry in california better education for their children and living opportunities in communities where they could vote.77 in the 1950s the state created new requirements for a citizenship test for voter registration despite opposition by the states rights party downstate black voters began to increase their rate of registration which also reflected the growth of their middle classes gradually black voter registration and turnout increased to 20 and more and it was 32 in 1964 when the first national civil rights legislation of the era was passed.78 the percentage of black voters ranged widely in the state during these years from 93.8 in evangeline parish to 1.7 in tensas parish for instance.79 violent attacks on civil rights activists in two mill towns were catalysts to the founding of the first two chapters of the deacons for defense and justice in late 1964 and early 1965 in jonesboro and bogalusa respectively made up of veterans of world war ii and the korean war they were armed self-defense groups established to protect activists and their families continued violent white resistance in bogalusa to blacks trying to use public facilities in 1965 following passage of the civil rights act of 1964 caused the federal government to order local police to protect the activists.80 other chapters were formed in louisiana mississippi and alabama by 1960 the proportion of african americans in louisiana had dropped to 32% the 1039207 black citizens were suppressed by segregation and disfranchisement.81 african americans continued to suffer disproportionate discriminatory application of the state's voter registration rules because of better opportunities elsewhere from 1965 to 1970 blacks continued to migrate from louisiana for a net loss of more than 37000 people based on official census figures the african-american population in 1970 stood at 1085109 a net gain of more than 46000 people compared to 1960 during the latter period some people began to migrate to cities of the new south for opportunities.82 since that period blacks entered the political system and began to be elected to office as well as having other opportunities on 21st may 1919 the nineteenth amendment to the united states constitution giving women full rights to vote was passed at a national level and was made the law throughout the united states on 18th august 1920 louisiana finally ratified the amendment on 11th june 1970 in august 2005 new orleans and many other low-lying parts of the state along the gulf of mexico were hit by the catastrophic hurricane katrina it caused widespread damage due to breaching of levees and large-scale flooding of more than 80 of the city officials issued warnings to evacuate the city and nearby areas but tens of thousands of people mostly african americans stayed behind many of them stranded and suffered through the damage of the widespread floodwaters in august 2016 an unnamed storm dumped trillions of gallons of rain on southern louisiana including the cities of denham springs baton rouge and lafayette causing catastrophic flooding.83 an estimated 110000 homes were damaged84 and thousands of residents were displaced.85 demographicsedit the united states census bureau estimates that the population of louisiana was 4670724 on july 1

states.111 most parishes have an elected government known as the police jury dating from the colonial days it is the legislative and executive government of the parish and is elected by the voters its members are called jurors and together they elect a president as their chairman civil lawedit the louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of french and spanish governance one is the use of the term parish from the french paroisse in place of county for administrative subdivision another is the legal system of civil law based on french german and spanish legal codes and ultimately roman law as opposed to english common law louisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use especially in europe and its former colonies excluding those that derive from the british empire however it is incorrect to equate the louisiana civil code with the napoleonic code although the napoleonic code and louisiana law draw from common legal roots the napoleonic code was never in force in louisiana as it was enacted in 1804 after the united states had purchased and annexed louisiana in 1803 while the louisiana civil code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment it is still considered the controlling authority in the state differences are found between louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other u.s states while some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition112 the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of louisiana private law thus property contractual business entities structure much of civil procedure and family law as well as some aspects of criminal law are still based mostly on traditional roman legal thinking marriageedit in 1997 louisiana became the first state to offer the option of a traditional marriage or a covenant marriage.113 in a covenant marriage the couple waives their right to a

party affiliation run in a nonpartisan blanket primary or jungle primary on election day if no candidate has more than 50 of the vote the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later this run-off did not take into account party identification therefore it was not uncommon for a democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow democrat or a republican to be in a runoff with a fellow republican congressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system all other states except washington and california use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates each conducted by either a plurality voting system or runoff voting to elect senators representatives and statewide officials between 2008 and 2010 federal congressional elections were run under a closed primary system  limited to registered party members however upon the passage of house bill 292 louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections louisiana has six seats in the u.s house of representatives five of which are currently held by republicans and one by a democrat

typically people of color descendants of free mixed-race families of the colonial and early statehood periods african cultureedit the french colony of la louisiane struggled for decades to survive conditions were harsh the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew and they suffered from regional tropical diseases both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates the settlers kept importing slaves which resulted in a high proportion of native africans from west africa who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings as described by historian gwendolyn midlo hall they developed a marked afro-creole culture in the colonial era.127128 at the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s new orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the haitian revolution many of whom brought their slaves with them this added another infusion of african culture to the city as more slaves in saint-domingue were from africa than in the united states they strongly influenced the african-american culture of the city in terms of dance music and religious practices louisiana creole cultureedit creole culture is an amalgamation of french african spanish and other european and native american cultures.129 creole comes from the portuguese word crioulo originally it referred to a colonist of european specifically french descent who was born in the new world in comparison to immigrants from france.130 the oldest louisiana manuscript to use the word creole from 1782 applied it to a slave born in the french colony.131 but originally it referred more generally to the french colonists born in louisiana over time there developed in the french colony a relatively large group of creoles of color gens de couleur libres who were primarily descended from african slave women and french men later other europeans became part of the mix as well as some native americans. often the french would free their concubines and mixed-race children and pass on social capital to them they might educate sons in france for instance and help them enter the french army for a career they also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children the free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education they generally spoke french and were roman catholic many became artisans and property owners over time the term creole became associated with this class of creoles of color many of whom achieved freedom long before the civil war wealthy french creoles generally maintained town houses in new orleans as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the mississippi river new orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region they could find work there and created their own culture marrying among themselves for decades acadian cultureedit the ancestors of cajuns immigrated from west central france to new france where they settled in the atlantic provinces of new brunswick and nova scotia known originally as acadia after the british defeated france in the french and indian war seven years war in 1763 france ceded its territory east of the mississippi river to britain the british forcibly separated families and evicted them from acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new british regime the acadians were deported to england new england and france some escaped the british remained in french canada others scattered to france canada mexico or the falkland islands many acadian refugees settled in south louisiana in the region around lafayette and the lafourche bayou country they developed a distinct rural culture there that was different from that of the french creole colonists in the new orleans area intermarrying with others in the area they developed what was called cajun music cuisine and culture until the 1970s the term cajun was considered somewhat derogatory languagesedit according to a 2010 study by the modern language association among persons five years old and older132 91.26 of louisiana residents speak only english at home 3.45 speak french standard french french creole or cajun french 3.30 speak spanish and 0.59 speak vietnamese historically native american peoples in the area at the time of european encounter were seven tribes distinguished by their languages caddo tunica natchez houma choctaw atakapa and chitimacha of these only caddo and choctaw still have living native speakers although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages other native american peoples migrated into the region escaping from european pressure from the east among these were alabama biloxi koasati and ofo peoples starting in the 1700s french colonists began to settle along the coast and founded new orleans they established french culture and language institutions they imported thousands of slaves from tribes of west africa who spoke several different languages in the creolization process the slaves developed a louisiana creole dialect incorporating both french and african forms which colonists adopted to communicate with them and which persisted beyond slavery in the 20th century there were still people of mixed race particularly who spoke louisiana creole french during the 19th century after the louisiana purchase by the united states english gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous americans who were english speakers many ethnic french families continued to use french in private slaves and some free people of color also spoke louisiana creole french the state constitution of 1812 gave english official status in legal proceedings but use of french remained widespread subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of french the 1868 constitution passed during the reconstruction era before louisiana was re-admitted to the union banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than english subsequently the legal status of french recovered somewhat but it never regained its pre-civil war prominence.133 several unique dialects of french creole and english are spoken in louisiana dialects of the french language are colonial french and houma french louisiana creole french is the term for one of the creole languages two unique dialects developed of the english language louisiana english a french-influenced variety of english and what is informally known as yat which resembles the new york city dialect particularly that of historical brooklyn both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant irish and italians but the yat dialect which developed in new orleans was also influenced by french and spanish colonial french was the dominant language of white settlers in louisiana during the french colonial period it was spoken primarily by the french creoles native-born in addition to this dialect the mixed-race people and slaves developed louisiana creole with a base in west african languages the limited years of spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the spanish language french and louisiana creole are still used in modern-day louisiana often in family gatherings english and its associated dialects became predominant after the louisiana purchase of 1803 after which the area became dominated by numerous english speakers in some regions english was influenced by french as seen with louisiana english colonial french although mistakenly named cajun french by some cajuns has persisted alongside english renewed interest in the french language in louisiana has led to the establishment of canadian-modeled french immersion schools as well as bilingual signage in the historic french neighborhoods of new orleans and lafayette organizations such as codofil promote use of the french language in the state literatureedit religionedit the largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the catholic church with 1200900 southern baptist convention with 709650 and the united methodist church with 146848 non-denominational evangelical protestant congregations had 195903 members.134 as in other southern states the majority of louisianians belong to various protestant denominations with protestants comprising 57 of the state's adult population protestants are concentrated in the northern and central parts of the state and in the northern tier of the florida parishes because of french and spanish heritage and their descendants the creoles and later irish italian portuguese and german immigrants southern louisiana and the greater new orleans area are predominantly catholic.135 since creoles were the first settlers planters and leaders of the territory they have traditionally been well represented in politics for instance most of the early governors were creole catholics.136 because catholics still constitute a significant fraction of louisiana's population they have continued to be influential in state politics as of 2008update both senators and the governor were catholic the high proportion and influence of the catholic population makes louisiana distinct among southern states.137 jewish communities are established in the state's larger cities notably new orleans and baton rouge.138139 the most significant of these is the jewish community of the new orleans area in 2000 before the 2005 hurricane katrina its population was about 12000 louisiana was among the southern states with a significant jewish population before the 20th century virginia south carolina and georgia also had influential jewish populations in some of their major cities from the 18th and 19th centuries the earliest jewish colonists were sephardic jews who immigrated with english colonists from london later in the 19th century german jews began to immigrate followed by those from eastern europe and the russian empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries musicedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit

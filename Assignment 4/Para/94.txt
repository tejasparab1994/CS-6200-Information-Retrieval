in mixtures containing two or more components the concentrations of each component are often expressed as mole fractions the mole fraction of a given component of a mixture in a particular phase either the vapor or the liquid phase is the number of moles of that component in that phase divided by the total number of moles of all components in that phase  contents  pure single-component systemsedit if the liquid and vapor are pure in that they consist of only one molecular component and no impurities then the equilibrium state between the two phases is described by the following equations wherepliqdisplaystyle p^liq andpvapdisplaystyle p^vap are the pressures within the liquid and vaportliqdisplaystyle t^liq andtvapdisplaystyle t^vap are the temperatures within the liquid and vapor andgliqdisplaystyle tilde g^liq andgvapdisplaystyle tilde g^vap are the molar gibbs free energies units of energy per amount of substance within the liquid and vapor respectively.4 in other words the temperature pressure and molar gibbs free energy are the same between the two phases when they are at equilibrium multicomponent systemsedit in a multicomponent system where the vapor and liquid consist of more than one type of molecule describing the equilibrium state is more complicated for all components i in the system the equilibrium state between the two phases is described by the following equations where p and t are the temperature and pressure for each phase andgiliqdisplaystyle bar g_i^liq andgivapdisplaystyle bar g_i^vap are the partial molar gibbs free energy also called chemical potential units of energy per amount of substance within the liquid and vapor respectively for each phase the partial molar gibbs free energy is defined by boiling-point diagramsedit in multi-component mixtures in general with n components this becomes for certain pairs of substances the two curves also coincide at some point strictly between x1  0 and x1  1 when they meet they meet tangently the dew-point temperature always lies above the boiling-point temperature for a given composition when they are not equal the meeting point is called an azeotrope for that particular pair of substances it is characterized by an azeotrope temperature and an azeotropic composition often expressed as a mole fraction there can be maximum-boiling azeotropes where the azeotrope temperature is at a maximum in the boiling curves or minimum-boiling azeotropes where the azeotrope temperature is at a minimum in the boiling curves if one wants to represent a vle data for a three-component mixture as a boiling point diagram a three-dimensional graph can be used two of the dimensions would be used to represent the composition mole fractions and the third dimension would be the temperature using two dimensions the composition can be represented as an equilateral triangle in which each corner represents one of the pure components the edges of the triangle represent a mixture of the two components at each end of the edge any point inside the triangle represents the composition of a mixture of all three components the mole fraction of each component would correspond to where a point lies along a line starting at that component's corner and perpendicular to the opposite edge the bubble point and dew point data would become curved surfaces inside a triangular prism which connect the three boiling points on the vertical temperature axes each face of this triangular prism would represent a two-dimensional boiling-point diagram for the corresponding binary mixture due to their three-dimensional complexity such boiling-point diagrams are rarely seen alternatively the three-dimensional curved surfaces can be represented on a two-dimensional graph by the use of curved isotherm lines at graduated intervals similar to iso-altitude lines on a map two sets of such isotherm lines are needed on such a two-dimensional graph one set for the bubble point surface and another set for the dew point surface k values and relative volatility valuesedit for raoult's law for modified raoult's law the values of the ratio ki are correlated empirically or theoretically in terms of temperature pressure and phase compositions in the form of equations tables or graph such as the depriester charts shown on the right.7 which is a measure of the relative ease or difficulty of separating the two components large-scale industrial distillation is rarely undertaken if the relative volatility is less than 1.05 with the volatile component being i and the less volatile component being j.2 k values are widely used in the design calculations of continuous distillation columns for distilling multicomponent mixtures such vle diagrams are square with a diagonal line running from the x1  0 y1  0 corner to the x1  1 y1  1 corner for reference raoult's lawedit at boiling and higher temperatures the sum of the individual component partial pressures becomes equal to the overall pressure which can symbolized as ptot under such conditions dalton's law would be in effect as follows then for each component in the vapor phase where p1  partial pressure of component 1 p2  partial pressure of component 2 etc raoult's law is approximately valid for mixtures of components between which there is very little interaction other than the effect of dilution by the other components examples of such mixtures includes mixtures of alkanes which are non-polar relatively inert compounds in many ways so there is little attraction or repulsion between the molecules raoult's law states that for components 1 2 etc in a mixture at boiling temperatures if raoult's law applies the total pressure becomes at boiling temperatures if raoult's law applies a number of the preceding equations in this section can be combined to give the following expressions for vapor mole fractions as a function of liquid mole fractions and temperature once the bubble point t's as a function of liquid composition in terms of mole fractions have been determined these values can be inserted into the above equations to obtain corresponding vapor compositions in terms of mole fractions when this is finished over a complete range of liquid mole fractions and their corresponding temperatures one effectively obtains a temperature t function of vapor composition mole fractions this function effectively acts as the dew point t function of vapor composition in the case of a binary mixture x2  1  x1 and the above equations can be expressed as for many kinds of mixtures particularly where there is interaction between components beyond simply the effects of dilution raoult's law does not work well for determining the shapes of the curves in the boiling point or vle diagrams even in such mixtures there are usually still differences in the vapor and liquid equilibrium concentrations at most points and distillation is often still useful for separating components at least partially for such mixtures empirical data is typically used in determining such boiling point and vle diagrams chemical engineers have done a significant amount of research trying to develop equations for correlating and/or predicting vle data for various kinds of mixtures which do not obey raoult's law well see alsoedit external linksedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces

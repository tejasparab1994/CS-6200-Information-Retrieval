international space station the international space station iss is a space station or a habitable artificial satellite in low earth orbit its first component launched into orbit in 1998 and the iss is now the largest human-made body in low earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from earth.89 the iss consists of pressurised modules external trusses solar arrays and other components iss components have been launched by russian proton and soyuz rockets and american space shuttles.10 after the u.s space shuttle programme ended in 2011 soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the international space station and dragon became the only provider of bulk cargo return to earth called downmass soyuz has very limited downmass capability the iss programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies nasa roscosmos jaxa esa and csa.1618 the ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements.19 the station is divided into two sections the russian orbital segment ros and the united states orbital segment usos which is shared by many nations as of january 2014update the american portion of iss is being funded until 2024.202122 roscosmos has endorsed the continued operation of iss through 202423 but has proposed using elements of the russian orbital segment to construct a new russian space station called opsek.24 on 28 march 2015 russian sources announced that roscosmos and nasa had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current iss.2526 nasa later issued a guarded statement expressing thanks for russia's interest in future co-operation in space exploration but fell short of confirming the russian announcement.2728 contents purpose according to the original memorandum of understanding between nasa and rosaviakosmos the international space station was intended to be a laboratory observatory and factory in low earth orbit it was also planned to provide transportation maintenance and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the moon mars and asteroids.29 in the 2010 united states national space policy the iss was given additional roles of serving commercial diplomatic30 and educational purposes.31 scientific research the iss provides a platform to conduct scientific research small unmanned spacecraft can provide platforms for zero gravity and exposure to space but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades combined with ready access by human researchers over periods that exceed the capabilities of manned spacecraft.1732 the iss simplifies individual experiments by eliminating the need for separate rocket launches and research staff the wide variety of research fields include astrobiology astronomy human research including space medicine and life sciences physical sciences materials science space weather and weather on earth meteorology.1112133334 scientists on earth have access to the crew's data and can modify experiments or launch new ones which are benefits generally unavailable on unmanned spacecraft.32 crews fly expeditions of several months duration providing approximately 160-man-hours per week of labour with a crew of 6.1135 to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe engineers and scientists from all over the world built the alpha magnetic spectrometer ams which nasa compares to the hubble space telescope and says could not be accommodated on a free flying satellite platform partly because of its power requirements and data bandwidth needs.3637 on 3 april 2013 nasa scientists reported that hints of dark matter may have been detected by the alpha magnetic spectrometer.383940414243 according to the scientists the first results from the space-borne alpha magnetic spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in earth-bound cosmic rays. the space environment is hostile to life unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind in addition to cosmic rays high vacuum extreme temperatures and microgravity.44 some simple forms of life called extremophiles45 including small invertebrates called tardigrades46 can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state called desiccation medical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body including muscle atrophy bone loss and fluid shift this data will be used to determine whether lengthy human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible as of 2006update data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise such as the six-month interval required to travel to mars.4748 medical studies are conducted aboard the iss on behalf of the national space biomedical research institute nsbri prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts the study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space usually there is no physician on board the iss and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge it is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.495051 microgravity the earth's gravity is only slightly weaker at the altitude of the iss than at the surface but objects in orbit are in a continuous state of freefall resulting in an apparent state of weightlessness this perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five separate effects:52 researchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution development growth and internal processes of plants and animals in response to some of this data nasa wants to investigate microgravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional human-like tissues and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space.12 investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on earth in addition examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity.12 the study of materials science is an important iss research activity with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground.53 other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants these findings may improve current knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits future plans are for the researchers aboard the iss to examine aerosols ozone water vapour and oxides in earth's atmosphere as well as cosmic rays cosmic dust antimatter and dark matter in the universe.12 exploration the iss provides a location in the relative safety of low earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the moon and mars this provides experience in operations maintenance as well as repair and replacement activities on-orbit which will be essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from earth mission risks can be reduced and the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft advanced.14 referring to the mars-500 experiment esa states that whereas the iss is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness radiation and other space-specific factors aspects such as the effect of long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based simulations.54 sergey krasnov the head of human space flight programmes for russia's space agency roscosmos in 2011 suggested a shorter version of mars-500 may be carried out on the iss.55 in 2009 noting the value of the partnership framework itself sergey krasnov wrote when compared with partners acting separately partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration the iss is helping further advance near-earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the solar system including the moon and mars.56 a manned mission to mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current iss partnership in 2010 esa director-general jean-jacques dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that china india and south korea be invited to join the iss partnership.57 nasa chief charlie bolden stated in february 2011 any mission to mars is likely to be a global effort.58 currently american legislation prevents nasa co-operation with china on space projects.59 education and cultural outreach the iss crew provides opportunities for students on earth by running student-developed experiments making educational demonstrations allowing for student participation in classroom versions of iss experiments and directly engaging students using radio videolink and email.1660 esa offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms.61 in one lesson students can navigate a 3-d model of the interior and exterior of the iss and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time.62 cultural activities are another major objective tetsuo tanaka director of jaxa's space environment and utilization center says there is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science.67 amateur radio on the iss ariss is a volunteer programme which encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science technology engineering and mathematics through amateur radio communications opportunities with the iss crew ariss is an international working group consisting of delegations from nine countries including several countries in europe as well as japan russia canada and the united states in areas where radio equipment cannot be used speakerphones connect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the station.68 first orbit is a feature-length documentary film about vostok 1 the first manned space flight around the earth by matching the orbit of the international space station to that of vostok 1 as closely as possible in terms of ground path and time of day documentary filmmaker christopher riley and esa astronaut paolo nespoli were able to film the view that yuri gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight this new footage was cut together with the original vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the russian state archive nespoli during expedition 26/27 filmed the majority of the footage for this documentary film and as a result is credited as its director of photography.69 the film was streamed through the website firstorbit.org in a global youtube premiere in 2011 under a free license.70 in may 2013 commander chris hadfield shot a music video of david bowie's space oddity on board the station the film was released freely on youtube.71 it was the first music video ever to be filmed in space.72 assembly the assembly of the international space station a major endeavour in space architecture began in november 1998.5 russian modules launched and docked robotically with the exception of rassvet all other modules were delivered by the space shuttle which required installation by iss and shuttle crewmembers using the canadarm2 ssrms and extra-vehicular activities evas as of 5 june 2011update they had added 159 components during more than 1000 hours of eva see list of iss spacewalks 127 of these spacewalks originated from the station and the remaining 32 were launched from the airlocks of docked space shuttles.4 the beta angle of the station had to be considered at all times during construction as it directly affects how long during its orbit the station and any docked or docking spacecraft is exposed to the sun the space shuttle would not perform optimally above a limit called the beta cutoff.73 many of the modules that launched on the space shuttle were integrated and tested on the ground at the space station processing facility to find and correct issues prior to launch the first module of the iss zarya was launched on 20 november 1998 on an autonomous russian proton rocket it provided propulsion attitude control communications electrical power but lacked long-term life support functions two weeks later a passive nasa module unity was launched aboard space shuttle flight sts-88 and attached to zarya by astronauts during evas this module has two pressurized mating adapters pmas one connects permanently to zarya the other allows the space shuttle to dock to the space station at that time the russian station mir was still inhabited the iss remained unmanned for two years while mir was de-orbited on 12 july 2000 zvezda was launched into orbit preprogrammed commands on board deployed its solar arrays and communications antenna it then became the passive target for a rendezvous with zarya and unity it maintained a station-keeping orbit while the zarya-unity vehicle performed the rendezvous and docking via ground control and the russian automated rendezvous and docking system zarya's computer transferred control of the station to zvezda's computer soon after docking zvezda added sleeping quarters a toilet kitchen co2 scrubbers dehumidifier oxygen generators exercise equipment plus data voice and television communications with mission control this enabled permanent habitation of the station.7475 expedition 1 arrived midway between the flights of sts-92 and sts-97 these two space shuttle flights each added segments of the station's integrated truss structure which provided the station with ku-band communication for us television additional attitude support needed for the additional mass of the usos and substantial solar arrays supplementing the station's existing 4 solar arrays.82 over the next two years the station continued to expand a soyuz-u rocket delivered the pirs docking compartment the space shuttles discovery atlantis and endeavour delivered the destiny laboratory and quest airlock in addition to the station's main robot arm the canadarm2 and several more segments of the integrated truss structure the expansion schedule was interrupted by the space shuttle columbia disaster in 2003 and a resulting two-year hiatus in the space shuttle programme the space shuttle was grounded until 2005 with sts-114 flown by discovery.83 as of june 2011update the station consisted of 15 pressurised modules and the integrated truss structure five modules are still to be launched including the nauka with the european robotic arm the uzlovoy module and two power modules called nem-1 and nem-2.87 as of august 2017update russia's future primary research module nauka is set to launch in the first quarter of 2018 along with the european robotic arm which will be able to relocate itself to different parts of the russian modules of the station after the nauka module is attached the uzlovoy module will be attached to one of its docking ports when completed the station will have a mass of more than 400 tonnes 440 short tons.5 station structure the iss is a third generation89 modular space station.90 modular stations can allow the mission to be changed over time and new modules can be added or removed from the existing structure allowing greater flexibility below is a diagram of major station components the blue areas are pressurised sections accessible by the crew without using spacesuits the station's unpressurised superstructure is indicated in red other unpressurised components are yellow note that the unity node joins directly to the destiny laboratory for clarity they are shown apart comparison the iss follows salyut and almaz series skylab and mir as the 11th space station launched as the genesis prototypes were never intended to be manned other examples of modular station projects include the soviet/russian mir and the planned russian opsek and chinese space station first generation space stations such as early salyuts and nasa's skylab were not designed for re-supply.91 generally each crew had to depart the station to free the only docking port for the next crew to arrive skylab had more than one docking port but was not designed for resupply salyut 6 and 7 had more than one docking port and were designed to be resupplied routinely during crewed operation.92 pressurised modules zarya zarya was built from december 1994 to january 1998 at the khrunichev state research and production space center khsc in moscow the control system was developed by the ukrainian khartron corporation in kharkiv although only designed to fly autonomously for six to eight months zarya did so for almost two years because of delays with the russian service module zvezda which finally launched on 12 july 2000 and docked with zarya on 26 july using the russian kurs docking system unity unity was carried into orbit by space shuttle endeavour in 1998 as the primary cargo of sts-88 the first space shuttle mission dedicated to assembly of the station on 6 december 1998 the sts-88 crew mated the aft berthing port of unity with the forward hatch of the already orbiting zarya module zvezda the hull of zvezda was completed in february 1985 with major internal equipment installed by october 1986.94 the module was launched by a proton-k rocket from site 81/23 at baikonur on 12 july 2000 zvezda is at the rear of the station according to its normal direction of travel and orientation and its engines may be used to boost the station's orbit alternatively russian and european spacecraft can dock to zvezda's aft port and use their engines to boost the station.9697 destiny destiny also known as the u.s lab is the primary research facility for united states payloads aboard the iss in 2011 nasa chose the not-for-profit group center for the advancement of science in space casis to be the sole manager of all american science on the station which does not relate to manned exploration the module houses 24 international standard payload racks some of which are used for environmental systems and crew daily living equipment destiny also serves as the mounting point for the station's truss structure.98 quest quest is the only usos airlock and hosts spacewalks with both united states emu and russian orlan spacesuits it consists of two segments the equipment lock which stores spacesuits and equipment and the crew lock from which astronauts can exit into space this module has a separately controlled atmosphere crew sleep in this module breathing a low nitrogen mixture the night before scheduled evas to avoid decompression sickness known as the bends in the low-pressure suits.99 pirs and poisk harmony tranquility tranquility also known as node 3 is the third and last of the station's us nodes it contains an additional life support system to recycle waste water for crew use and supplements oxygen generation like the other us nodes it has six berthing mechanisms five of which are currently in use the first one connects to the station's core via the unity module others host the cupola the pma docking port #3 the leonardo pmm and the bigelow expandable activity module the final zenith port remains free columbus columbus the primary research facility for european payloads aboard the iss provides a generic laboratory as well as facilities specifically designed for biology biomedical research and fluid physics several mounting locations are affixed to the exterior of the module which provide power and data to external experiments such as the european technology exposure facility eutef solar monitoring observatory materials international space station experiment and atomic clock ensemble in space a number of expansions are planned for the module to study quantum physics and cosmology.102103 esa's development of technologies on all the main areas of life support has been ongoing for more than 20 years and are/have been used in modules such as columbus and the atv the german aerospace center dlr manages ground control operations for columbus and the atv is controlled from the french cnes toulouse space center pressurized module experiment logistics module exposed facility experiment logistics module remote manipulator system cupola rassvet leonardo bigelow expandable activity module bigelow expandable activity module beam is a prototype inflatable space habitat serving as a two-year technology demonstration.119 it was built by bigelow aerospace under a contract established by nasa on 16 january 2013 beam was delivered to the iss aboard spacex crs-8 on 10 april 2016 was berthed to the aft port of the tranquility node on 16 april120121 and was fully expanded on 28 may.122 during its two-year test run instruments are measuring its structural integrity and leak rate along with temperature and radiation levels the hatch leading into the module remains closed except for periodic visits by space station crew members for inspections and data collection the module was originally planned to be jettisoned from the station following the test123 but following positive data after a year in orbit nasa has suggested that it could remain on the station as a storage area.124 elements pending russia launch nauka nauka's mission has changed over time during the mid-1990s it was intended as a backup for the fgb and later as a universal docking module udm its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft additional modules and fuel transfer nauka has its own engines like zvezda and zarya nauka will be launched by a proton rocket while smaller russian modules such as pirs and poisk were delivered by modified progress spacecraft russia plans to separate nauka along with the rest of the russian orbital segment to form the opsek space station before the iss is deorbited uzlovoy module the uzlovoy module um or node module is a 4-metric-ton128 ball-shaped module that will allow docking of two scientific and power modules during the final stage of the station assembly and provide the russian segment additional docking ports to receive soyuz ms and progress ms spacecraft um is due to be launched in late 2018 it will be integrated with a special version of the progress cargo ship and launched by a standard soyuz rocket progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the node module to the nadir earth-facing docking port of the nauka mlm/fgb-2 module one port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port which enables docking with the mlm module the remaining five ports are passive hybrids enabling docking of soyuz and progress vehicles as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems the node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of the future russian successor to the iss opsek equipped with six docking ports the node module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required.129130 this would be a progression beyond the iss and russia's modular mir space station which are in turn more advanced than early monolithic first generation stations such as skylab and early salyut and almaz stations science power modules 1  2 elements pending us launch international docking adapter the international docking adapter ida is a spacecraft docking system adapter being developed to convert apas-95 to the nasa docking system nds international docking system standard idss an ida will be placed on each of the international space station's iss two open pressurized mating adapters pma both of which will be connected to node-2 harmony module nanoracks airlock module the nanoracks airlock module is a commercially-funded airlock module intended to be launched in 2019 the module is being built by nanoracks and boeing131 and will be used to deploy cubesats small satellites and other external payloads for nasa casis and other commercial and governmental customers it is intended to be manifested with a commercial resupply services mission.132 cancelled components several modules planned for the station were cancelled over the course of the iss programme reasons include budgetary constraints the modules becoming unnecessary and station redesigns after the 2003 columbia disaster the us centrifuge accommodations module would have hosted science experiments in varying levels of artificial gravity.133 the us habitation module would have served as the station's living quarters instead the sleep stations are now spread throughout the station.134 the us interim control module and iss propulsion module would have replaced the functions of zvezda in case of a launch failure.135 two russian research modules were planned for scientific research.136 they would have docked to a russian universal docking module.137 the russian science power platform would have supplied power to the russian orbital segment independent of the its solar arrays unpressurised elements the station in its complete form has several smaller external components such as the six robotic arms the three external stowage platforms esps and four express logistics carriers elcs.139140 while these platforms allow experiments including misse the stp-h3 and the robotic refueling mission to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally their primary function is to store spare orbital replacement units orus orus are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life examples of orus include pumps storage tanks antennas and battery units such units are replaced either by astronauts during eva or by robotic arms spare parts were routinely transported to and from the station via space shuttle resupply missions with a heavy emphasis on oru transport once the nasa shuttle approached retirement.141 several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of orus including sts-129142 sts-133143 and sts-134.144 as of january 2011update only one other mode of transportation of orus had been utilised  the japanese cargo vessel htv-2  which delivered an fhrc and ctc-2 via its exposed pallet ep.145needs update robotic arms and cargo cranes station systems life support the critical systems are the atmosphere control system the water supply system the food supply facilities the sanitation and hygiene equipment and fire detection and suppression equipment the russian orbital segment's life support systems are contained in the zvezda service module some of these systems are supplemented by equipment in the usos the mlm nauka laboratory has a complete set of life support systems atmospheric control systems the elektron system aboard zvezda and a similar system in destiny generate oxygen aboard the station.164 the crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and solid fuel oxygen generation sfog canisters a chemical oxygen generator system.165 carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the vozdukh system in zvezda other by-products of human metabolism such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat are removed by activated charcoal filters.165 the us orbital segment has redundant supplies of oxygen from a pressurised storage tank on the quest airlock module delivered in 2001 supplemented ten years later by esa-built advanced closed-loop system acls in the tranquility module node 3 which produces o2 by electrolysis.167 hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and converted to water and methane power and thermal control double-sided solar or photovoltaic arrays provide electrical power for the iss these bifacial cells are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than single-sided cells commonly used on earth by collecting sunlight on one side and light reflected off the earth on the other.168 the station's large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere this could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath to mitigate this plasma contactor units pcus create current paths between the station and the ambient plasma field.173 the station's systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power almost all of which converts to heat little of this heat dissipates through the walls of the station to keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable workable limits ammonia is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation then back into the station.174 thus this passive thermal control system ptcs is made of external surface materials insulation such as mli and heat pipes communications and computers radio communications provide telemetry and scientific data links between the station and mission control centres radio links are also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members flight controllers and family members as a result the iss is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes.176 uhf radio is used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting evas uhf is used by other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station such as soyuz progress htv atv and the space shuttle except the shuttle also makes use of the s band and ku band systems via tdrss to receive commands from mission control and iss crewmembers.16 automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment the atv uses a laser attached to the spacecraft and equipment attached to zvezda known as the proximity communications equipment to accurately dock to the station.184185 the operating system used for key station functions is the debian linux distribution.188 the migration from microsoft windows was made in may 2013 for reasons of reliability stability and flexibility.189 station operations expeditions and private flights see also the list of international space station expeditions professional crew space tourism private travellers and the list of human spaceflights to the iss both each permanent crew is given an expedition number expeditions run up to six months from launch until undocking an 'increment covers the same time period but includes cargo ships and all activities expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of 3 person crews expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to the safe minimum of two following the destruction of the nasa shuttle columbia from expedition 13 the crew gradually increased to 6 around 2010.190191 with the arrival of the american commercial crew vehicles in the middle of the 2010s expedition size may be increased to seven crew members the number iss is designed for.192193 travellers who pay for their own passage into space are termed spaceflight participants by roscosmos and nasa and are sometimes referred to as space tourists a term they generally dislike.note 1 all seven were transported to the iss on russian soyuz spacecraft when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a soyuz and a short-stay crewmember is not sent the spare seat is sold by mircorp through space adventures when the space shuttle retired in 2011 and the station's crew size was reduced to 6 space tourism was halted as the partners relied on russian transport seats for access to the station soyuz flight schedules increase after 2013 allowing 5 soyuz flights 15 seats with only two expeditions 12 seats required.200 the remaining seats are sold for around us$40 million to members of the public who can pass a medical exam esa and nasa criticised private spaceflight at the beginning of the iss and nasa initially resisted training dennis tito the first man to pay for his own passage to the iss.note 2 anousheh ansari became the first iranian in space and the first self-funded woman to fly to the station officials reported that her education and experience make her much more than a tourist and her performance in training had been excellent.201 ansari herself dismisses the idea that she is a tourist she did russian and european studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10-day stay the documentary space tourists follows her journey to the station where she fulfilled an age-old dream of man to leave our planet as a normal person and travel into outer space.202 in 2008 spaceflight participant richard garriott placed a geocache aboard the iss during his flight.203 this is currently the only non-terrestrial geocache in existence.204 at the same time the immortality drive an electronic record of eight digitised human dna sequences was placed aboard the iss.205 orbit orbital boosting can be performed by the station's two main engines on the zvezda service module or russian or european spacecraft docked to zvezda's aft port the atv has been designed with the possibility of adding a second docking port to its other end allowing it to remain at the iss and still allow other craft to dock and boost the station it takes approximately two orbits three hours for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed.210 maintaining iss altitude uses about 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel per annum211 at an annual cost of about $210 million.212 in december 2008 nasa signed an agreement with the ad astra rocket company which may result in the testing on the iss of a vasimr plasma propulsion engine.213 this technology could allow station-keeping to be done more economically than at present.214215 the russian orbital segment contains the data management system which handles guidance navigation and control ros gnc for the entire station.95 initially zarya the first module of the station controlled the station until a short time after the russian service module zvezda docked and was transferred control zvezda contains the esa built dms-r data management system.216 using two fault-tolerant computers ftc zvezda computes the station's position and orbital trajectory using redundant earth horizon sensors solar horizon sensors as well as sun and star trackers the ftcs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting orientation zvezda uses gyroscopes and thrusters to turn itself around gyroscopes do not require propellant rather they use electricity to 'store momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station's movement the usos has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section when gyroscopes 'saturate' thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum during expedition 10 an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed when attitude control computers in the ros and usos fail to communicate properly it can result in a rare 'force fight where the ros gnc computer must ignore the usos counterpart which has no thrusters.217218219 when an atv nasa shuttle or soyuz is docked to the station it can also be used to maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting shuttle control was used exclusively during installation of the s3/s4 truss which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.220 mission controls the components of the iss are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at mission control centres across the globe including repairs orbital replacement units orus are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails examples of orus are pumps storage tanks controller boxes antennas and battery units some units can be replaced using robotic arms many are stored outside the station either on small pallets called express logistics carriers elcs or share larger platforms called external stowage platforms which also hold science experiments both kinds of pallets have electricity as many parts which could be damaged by the cold of space require heating the larger logistics carriers also have computer local area network connections lan and telemetry to connect experiments a heavy emphasis on stocking the usos with oru's occurred around 2011 before the end of the nasa shuttle programme as its commercial replacements cygnus and dragon carry one tenth to one quarter the payload unexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and in some cases could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons had these problems not been resolved during sts-120 in 2007 following the relocation of the p6 truss and solar arrays it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly.221 an eva was carried out by scott parazynski assisted by douglas wheelock the men took extra precautions to reduce the risk of electric shock as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight.222 the issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard solar alpha rotary joint sarj which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard sarj until the cause was understood inspections during evas on sts-120 and sts-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage.223 repairs to the joint were carried out during sts-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.224225 2009 saw damage to the s1 radiator one of the components of the station's cooling system the problem was first noticed in soyuz imagery in september 2008 but was not thought to be serious.226 the imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel has peeled back from the underlying central structure possibly because of micro-meteoroid or debris impact it is also known that a service module thruster cover jettisoned during an eva in 2008 had struck the s1 radiator but its effect if any has not been determined on 15 may 2009 the damaged radiator panel's ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computer-controlled closure of a valve the same valve was used immediately afterwards to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak from the cooling system via the damaged panel.226 early on 1 august 2010 a failure in cooling loop a starboard side one of two external cooling loops left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.227228229 the problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid several subsystems including two of the four cmgs were shut down planned operations on the iss were interrupted through a series of evas to address the cooling system issue a first eva on 7 august 2010 to replace the failed pump module was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects a second eva on 11 august successfully removed the failed pump module.230231 a third eva was required to restore loop a to normal functionality.232233 the usos's cooling system is largely built by the american company boeing234 which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump.235 an air leak from the usos in 2004236 the venting of fumes from an elektron oxygen generator in 2006237 and the failure of the computers in the ros in 2007 during sts-117 left the station without thruster elektron vozdukh and other environmental control system operations the root cause of which was found to be condensation inside the electrical connectors leading to a short-circuit.citation needed the four main bus switching units mbsus located in the s0 truss control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the iss in late 2011 mbsu-1 while still routing power correctly ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available eva in each mbsu two power channels feed 160v dc from the arrays to two dc-to-dc power converters ddcus that supply the 124v power used in the station a spare mbsu was already on board but 30 august 2012 eva failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before electrical connection was secured.238 the loss of mbsu-1 limits the station to 75 of its normal power capacity requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem can be addressed on 24 december 2013 astronauts made a rare christmas eve space walk installing a new ammonia pump for the station's cooling system the faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month halting many of the station's science experiments astronauts had to brave a mini blizzard of ammonia while installing the new pump it was only the second christmas eve spacewalk in nasa history.240 fleet operations a wide variety of manned and unmanned spacecraft have supported the station's activities more than 60 progress spacecraft including m-mim2 and m-so1 which installed modules and more than 40 soyuz spacecraft have flown to the iss 35 flights of the retired nasa space shuttle were made to the station.4 there have been five european atv five japanese htv 'kounotori'

downside to this mode of operation is that each mission becomes unique and requires specialised training and planning making the process more labour-intensive and expensive the russians pursued an automated methodology that used the crew in override or monitoring roles although the initial development costs were high the system has become very reliable with standardisations that provide significant cost benefits in repetitive routine operations.255 an automated approach could allow assembly of modules orbiting other worlds prior to crew arrival from 26 february 2011 to 7 march 2011 four of the governmental partners united states esa japan and russia had their spacecraft nasa shuttle atv htv progress and soyuz docked at the iss the only time this has happened to date.260 on 25 may 2012 spacex became the world's first privately held company to send cargo via the dragon spacecraft to the international space station.261 launch and docking windows prior to a ship's docking to the iss navigation and attitude control gnc is handed over to the ground control of the ships country of origin gnc is set to allow the station to drift in space rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes the solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells when a nasa space shuttle docked to the station other ships were grounded as the shuttle's reinforced carbon-carbon wing leading edges cameras windows and instruments were too much at risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships movements approximately 30 of nasa shuttle launch delays were caused by poor weather occasional priority was given to the soyuz arrivals at the station where the soyuz carried crew with time-critical cargoes such as biological experiment materials also causing shuttle delays departure of the nasa shuttle was often delayed or prioritised according to weather over its two landing sites.262 whilst the soyuz is capable of landing anywhere anytime its planned landing time and place is chosen to give consideration to helicopter pilots and ground recovery crew to give acceptable flying weather and lighting conditions soyuz launches occur in adverse weather conditions but the cosmodrome has been shut down on occasions when buried by snow drifts up to 6 metres in depth hampering ground operations life aboard crew activities a typical day for the crew begins with a wake-up at 06:00 followed by post-sleep activities and a morning inspection of the station the crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with mission control before starting work at around 08:10 the first scheduled exercise of the day follows after which the crew continues work until 13:05 following a one-hour lunch break the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 19:30 including dinner and a crew conference the scheduled sleep period begins at 21:30 in general the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday and five hours on saturdays with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catch-up.263 the time zone used aboard the iss is coordinated universal time utc the windows are covered at night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day during visiting space shuttle missions the iss crew mostly follows the shuttle's mission elapsed time met which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the shuttle mission.264265266 the station provides crew quarters for each member of the expedition's crew with two 'sleep stations in the zvezda and four more installed in harmony.267268 the american quarters are private approximately person-sized soundproof booths the russian crew quarters include a small window but provide less ventilation and sound proofing a crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag listen to music use a laptop and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls the module also provides a reading lamp a shelf and a desktop.269270271 visiting crews have no allocated sleep module and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall it is possible to sleep floating freely through the station but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment.272 it is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated otherwise astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.269 food most of the food aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags cans are rare because they are heavy and expensive to transport preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew and taste is reduced in microgravity.269 therefore effort is made to make the food more palatable such as using more spices than in regular cooking the crew looks forward to the arrival of any ships from earth as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables care is taken that foods do not create crumbs sauces are often used to avoid contaminating station equipment each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them using the on-board galley the galley features two food warmers a refrigerator added in november 2008 and a water dispenser that provides both heated and unheated water.270 drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption.270271 drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away any food that floats away including crumbs must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.271 hygiene there are two space toilets on the iss both of russian design located in zvezda and tranquility.270 these waste and hygiene compartments use a fan-driven suction system similar to the space shuttle waste collection system astronauts first fasten themselves to the toilet seat which is equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal.269 a lever operates a powerful fan and a suction hole slides open the air stream carries the waste away solid waste is collected in individual bags which are stored in an aluminium container full containers are transferred to progress spacecraft for disposal.270276 liquid waste is evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet with anatomically correct urine funnel adapters attached to the tube so that men and women can use the same toilet the diverted urine is collected and transferred to the water recovery system where it is recycled into drinking water.271 crew health and safety radiation subatomic charged particles primarily protons from cosmic rays and solar wind are normally absorbed by earth's atmosphere when they interact in sufficient quantity their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora outside earth's atmosphere crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day which is about a year of natural exposure on earth this results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the dna and chromosomes of lymphocytes these cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.47 radiation levels on the iss are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low earth orbit as in the stratosphere for example on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in leo additionally airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight while iss crew are exposed for their whole stay.279 stress there is considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.280 cosmonaut valery ryumin wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the salyut 6 space station all the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them together for two months. nasa's interest in psychological stress caused by space travel initially studied when their manned missions began was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the russian space station mir common sources of stress in early american missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family the latter is still often a cause of stress on the iss such as when the mother of nasa astronaut daniel tani died in a car accident and when michael fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child medical medical effects of long-term weightlessness include muscle atrophy deterioration of the skeleton osteopenia fluid redistribution a slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass and puffiness of the face.47 sleep is disturbed on the iss regularly because of mission demands such as incoming or departing ships sound levels in the station are unavoidably high because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere which would stagnate in the freefall zero-g environment to prevent some of these adverse physiological effects the station is equipped with two treadmills including the colbert and the ared advanced resistive exercise device which enables various weightlifting exercises which add muscle but do not compensate for or raise astronauts reduced bone density282 and a stationary bicycle each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment.269270 astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill.283284 microbiological environmental hazards hazardous moulds which can foul air and water filters may develop aboard space stations they can produce acids which degrade metal glass and rubber they can also be harmful for the crew's health microbiological hazards have led to a development of the locad-pts that can identify common bacteria and moulds faster than standard methods of culturing which may require a sample to be sent back to earth.285 as of 2012update 76 types of unregulated micro-organisms have been detected on the iss.286 reduced humidity paint with mould-killing chemicals and antiseptic solutions can be used to prevent contamination in space stations all materials used in the iss are tested for resistance against fungi.287 threat of orbital debris end of mission according to a 2009 report space corporation energia is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the russian orbital segment when the end of mission is reached and use them as a basis for a new station called the orbital piloted assembly and experiment complex opsek the modules under consideration for removal from the current iss include the multipurpose laboratory module nauka currently scheduled to be launched in 2017 and other russian modules which are planned to be attached to nauka afterwards those modules would be within their useful lives in 2016 or 2020 the report presents a statement from an unnamed russian engineer that based on the experience from mir a 30-year life should be possible except for micrometeorite damage because the russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.300 according to the outer space treaty the united states and russia are legally responsible for all modules they have launched.301 in iss planning nasa examined options including returning the station to earth via shuttle missions deemed too expensive as the usos is not designed for disassembly and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions302 natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to skylab boosting the station to a higher altitude which would delay reentry and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area.303 a controlled deorbit into a remote ocean was found to be technically feasible only with russia's assistance.303 the russian space agency has experience from de-orbiting the salyut 4 5 6 7 and mir space stations nasa's first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite the compton gamma ray observatory occurred in 2000.304 as of late 2010 the preferred plan is to use a slightly modified progress spacecraft to de-orbit the iss.305 this plan was seen as the simplest cheapest and with the highest margin.305 skylab the only space station built and launched entirely by the us decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years and no attempt was made to de-orbit it using a deorbital burn remains of skylab hit populated areas of esperance western australia306 without injuries or loss of life the exploration gateway platform a discussion by nasa and boeing at the end of 2011 suggested using leftover usos hardware and 'zvezda 2 sic as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the earth-moon lagrange points l1 or l2 the entire usos cannot be reused and will be discarded but some russian modules are planned to be reused nauka the uzlovoy module two science power platforms and rassvet launched between 2010 and 2015 and joined to the ros may be separated to form opsek.307 nauka will be used in the station whose main goal is supporting manned deep space exploration opsek will orbit at a higher inclination of 71 degrees allowing observation to and from all of the russian federation a proposed modification that would reuse some of the iss american and european segments is to attach a vasimr drive module to the vacated node with its own onboard power source this would allow long-term reliability testing of the concept for less cost than building a dedicated space station from scratch.309 on 28 march 2015 russian sources announced that roscosmos and nasa had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current iss.2526 igor komarov the head of russia's roscosmos made the announcement with nasa administrator charles bolden at his side komarov said roscosmos together with nasa will work on the programme of a future orbital station we agreed that the group of countries taking part in the iss project will work on the future project of a new orbital station the first step is that the iss will operate until 2024 and that roscosmos and nasa do not rule out that the station's flight could be extended.310 in a statement provided to spacenews on 28 march nasa spokesman david weaver said the agency appreciated the russian commitment to extending the iss but did not confirm any plans for a future space station.28 on 30 september 2015 boeing's contract with nasa as prime contractor for the iss was extended to 30 september 2020 part of boeing's services under the contract will relate to extending the station's primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028.311 regarding extending the iss on 15 november 2016 general director vladimir solntsev of rsc energia stated maybe the iss will receive continued resources today we discussed the possibility of using the station until 2028 and much will depend on the political moments in relations with the americans with the new administration it will be discussed.312313 cost international co-operation sightings from earth naked eye tools are provided by a number of websites such as heavens-above see live viewing below as well as smartphone applications that use the known orbital data and the observer's longitude and latitude to predict when the iss will be visible weather permitting where the station will appear to rise to the observer the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears to the observer either by setting below the horizon or entering into earth's shadow.319320321322 in november 2012 nasa launched its spot the station service which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town.323 the station is visible from 95 of the inhabited land on earth but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes.206 astrophotography using a telescope-mounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers324 whilst using a mounted camera to photograph the earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew.325 the use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the iss during daylight hours.326 see also notes references external links agency iss websites research live viewing multimedia navigation menu personal tools

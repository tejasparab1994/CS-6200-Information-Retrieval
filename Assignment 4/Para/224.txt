beta plane the beta plane approximation is useful for the theoretical analysis of many phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics since it makes the equations much more tractable yet retains the important information that the coriolis parameter varies in space in particular rossby waves the most important type of waves if one considers large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics depend on the variation of f as a restoring force they do not occur if the coriolis parameter is approximated only as a constant see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

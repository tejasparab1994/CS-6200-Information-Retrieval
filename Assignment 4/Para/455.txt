oclc  contents  historyedit oclc began in 1967 as the ohio college library center through a collaboration of ohio university presidents vice presidents and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative computerized network for ohio libraries the group first met on july 5 1967 on the campus of the ohio state university to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization.5 the group hired frederick g kilgour a former yale university medical school librarian to design the shared cataloging system.6 kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time the computer with the oldest the library the plan was to merge the catalogs of ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations control costs and increase efficiency in library management the goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information to best serve researchers and scholars the first library to do online cataloging through oclc was the alden library at ohio university on august 26 1971 this was the first occurrence of online cataloging by any library worldwide.5 membership in oclc is based on use of services and contribution of data between 1967 and 1977 oclc membership was limited to institutions in ohio but in 1978 a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join in 2002 the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the united states.7 as oclc expanded services in the united states outside ohio it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with networks organizations that provided training support and marketing services by 2008 there were 15 independent united states regional service providers oclc networks played a key role in oclc governance with networks electing delegates to serve on oclc members council during 2008 oclc commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels at the same time the oclc members council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the board of trustees which severed the tie between the networks and governance in early 2009 oclc negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center.8 servicesedit oclc provides bibliographic abstract and full-text information to anyone the online computer library center acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the dewey decimal classification system when it bought forest press in 1988 a

grant from the bill  melinda gates foundation uses a strategy based on the findings of the 2008 oclc report from awareness to funding a study of library support in america.24 other past advocacy campaigns have focused on sharing the knowledge gained from library and information research such projects have included communities such as the society of american archivists the open archives initiative the institute for museum and library services the international organization for standardization the national information standards organization the world wide web consortium the internet engineering task force and internet2 one of the most successful contributions to this effort was the dublin core metadata initiative an open forum of libraries archives museums technology organizations and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models.21 oclc partnered with search engine providers in 2003 to advocate for libraries and share information across the broadest possible internet landscape google yahoo! and ask.com have all collaborated with oclc to make the worldcat records searchable through those search engines.21 online database worldcatedit oclc's worldcat database is used by librarians for cataloging and research contributions to worldcat are made via the connexion computer program which was introduced in 2001 its predecessor oclc passport was phased out in may 2005 worldcat contains records in machine readable cataloging marc format contributed by library catalogers worldwide who use oclc as a cataloging tool and these marc format records can also be downloaded into other libraries local catalog systems this allows libraries to find and download records for materials they are adding to their local catalog without having to undergo the lengthy process of creating a new catalog entry from scratch for each new item worldcat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web-based service called firstsearch26 as well as through the publicly available worldcat.org.27 identifiers and linked dataedit oclc assigns a unique control number referred to as an ocn for oclc control number to each new bibliographic record in the worldcat numbers are assigned serially and as of mid-2013 over a billion ocns had been created in september 2013 the oclc declared these numbers to be in the public domain removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of ocns outside oclc itself.28 the control numbers link worldcat's records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record across libraries.29 ocns are particularly useful as identifiers for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have isbns e.g. books published before 1970 ocns are used as identifiers often in wikipedia and wikidata in october 2013 it was reported that out of 29673 instances of infobox book in wikipedia there were 23304 isbns and 15226 ocns and regarding wikidata of around 14 million wikidata items 28741 were books 5403 wikidata items have an isbn associated with them and 12262 have ocns.30 oclc also runs

contour line a contour line also isoline isopleth isarithm or equipotential curve of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value so that the curve joins points of equal value.12 it is a plane section of the three-dimensional graph of the function fx y parallel to the x y plane in cartography a contour line often just called a contour joins points of equal elevation height above a given level such as mean sea level.3 a contour map is a map illustrated with contour lines for example a topographic map which thus shows valleys and hills and the steepness or gentleness of slopes.4 the contour interval of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive contour lines.5 more generally a contour line for a function of two variables is a curve connecting points where the function has the same particular value.2 the gradient of the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines when the lines are close together the magnitude of the gradient is large the variation is steep a level set is a generalization of a contour line for functions of any number of variables contour lines are curved straight or a mixture of both lines on a map describing the intersection of a real or hypothetical surface with one or more horizontal planes the configuration of these contours allows map readers to infer relative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific places contour lines may be either traced on a visible three-dimensional model of the surface as when a photogrammetrist viewing a stereo-model plots elevation contours or interpolated from estimated surface elevations as when a computer program threads contours through a network of observation points of area centroids in the latter case the method of interpolation affects the reliability of individual isolines and their portrayal of slope pits and peaks.6  contents  typesedit equidistant pointsedit a curve of equidistant points is a set of points all at the same distance from a given point line or polyline in this case the function whose value is being held constant along a contour line is a distance function isoplethsedit in meteorology the word isopleth is used for any type of contour line.11 meteorologyedit meteorological contour lines are based on interpolation of the point data received from weather stations and weather satellites weather stations are seldom exactly positioned at a contour line when they are this indicates a measurement precisely equal to the value of the contour instead lines are drawn to best approximate the locations of exact values based on the scattered information points available meteorological contour maps may present collected data such as actual air pressure at a given time or generalized data such as average pressure over a period of time or forecast data such as predicted air pressure at some point in the future thermodynamic diagrams use multiple overlapping contour sets including isobars and isotherms to present a picture of the major thermodynamic factors in a weather system barometric pressureedit isallobars are lines joining points of equal pressure change during a specific time interval.13 these can be divided into anallobars lines joining points of equal pressure increase during a specific time interval14 and katallobars lines joining points of equal pressure decrease.15 in general weather systems move along an axis joining high and low isallobaric centers.16 isallobaric gradients are important components of the wind as they increase or decrease the geostrophic wind an isopycnal is a line of constant density an isoheight or isohypse is a line of constant geopotential height on a constant pressure surface chart isohypse and isoheight are simply known as lines showing equal pressure on a map temperature and related subjectsedit an isogeotherm is a line of equal mean annual temperature an isocheim is a line of equal mean winter temperature and an isothere is a line of equal mean summer temperature rainfall and air moistureedit an isoneph is a line indicating equal cloud cover an isochalaz is a line of constant frequency of hail storms and an isobront is a line drawn through geographical points at which a given phase of thunderstorm activity occurred simultaneously snow cover is frequently shown as a contour-line map windedit freeze and thawedit an isopectic line denotes equal dates of ice formation each winter and an isotac denotes equal dates of thawing physical geography and oceanographyedit elevation and depthedit contours are one of several common methods used to denote elevation or altitude and depth on maps from these contours a sense of the general terrain can be determined they are used at a variety of scales from large-scale engineering drawings and architectural plans through topographic maps and bathymetric charts up to continental-scale maps contour line is the most common usage in cartography but isobath for underwater depths on bathymetric maps and isohypse for elevations are also used in cartography the contour interval is the elevation difference between adjacent contour lines the contour interval should be the same over a single map when calculated as a ratio against the map scale a sense of the hilliness of the terrain can be derived there are several rules to note when interpreting terrain contour lines of course to determine differences in elevation between two points the contour interval or distance in altitude between two adjacent contour lines must be known and this is normally stated in the map key usually contour intervals are consistent throughout a map but there are exceptions sometimes intermediate contours are present in flatter areas these can be dashed or dotted lines at half the noted contour interval when contours are used with hypsometric tints on a small-scale map that includes mountains and flatter low-lying areas it is common to have smaller intervals at lower elevations so that detail is shown in all areas conversely for an island which consists of a plateau surrounded by steep cliffs it is possible to use smaller intervals as the height increases.19 electrostaticsedit an isopotential map is a measure of electrostatic potential in space often depicted in two dimensions with the electostatic charges inducing that electric potential the term equipotential line or isopotential line refers to a curve of constant electric potential whether crossing an equipotential line represents ascending or descending the potential is inferred from the labels on the charges in three dimensions equipotential surfaces may be depicted with a two dimensional cross-section showing equipotential lines at the intersection of the surfaces and the cross-section the general mathematical term level set is often used to describe the full collection of points having a particular potential especially in higher dimensional space magnetismedit in the study of the earth's magnetic field the term isogon or isogonic line refers to a line of constant magnetic declination the variation of magnetic north from geographic north an agonic line is drawn through points of zero magnetic declination an isoporic line refers to a line of constant annual variation of magnetic declination .20 an isoclinic line connects points of equal magnetic dip and an aclinic line is the isoclinic line of magnetic dip zero oceanographyedit besides ocean depth oceanographers use contour to describe diffuse variable phenomena much as meteorologists do with atmospheric phenomena in particular isobathytherms are lines showing depths of water with equal temperature isohalines show lines of equal ocean salinity and isopycnals are surfaces of equal water density geologyedit various geological data are rendered as contour maps in structural geology sedimentology stratigraphy and economic geology contour maps are used to show the below ground surface of geologic strata fault surfaces especially low angle thrust faults and unconformities isopach maps use isopachs lines of equal thickness to illustrate variations in thickness of geologic units environmental scienceedit in discussing pollution density maps can be very useful in indicating sources and areas of greatest contamination contour maps are especially useful for diffuse forms or scales of pollution acid precipitation is indicated on maps with isoplats some of the most widespread applications of environmental science contour maps involve mapping of environmental noise where lines of equal sound pressure level are denoted isobels21 air pollution soil contamination thermal pollution and groundwater contamination by contour planting and contour ploughing the rate of water runoff and thus soil erosion can be substantially reduced this is especially important in riparian zones ecologyedit an isoflor is an isopleth contour connecting areas of comparable biological diversity usually the variable is the number of species of a given genus or family that occurs in a region isoflor maps are thus used to show distribution patterns and trends such as centres of diversity.22 social sciencesedit in economics contour lines can be used to describe features which vary quantitatively over space an isochrone shows lines of equivalent drive time or travel time to a given location and is used in the generation of isochrone maps an isotim shows equivalent transport costs from the source of a raw material and an isodapane shows equivalent cost of travel time contour lines are also used to display non-geographic information in economics indifference curves as shown at left are used to show bundles of goods to which a person would assign equal utility an isoquant in the image at right is a curve of equal production quantity for alternative combinations of input usages and an isocost curve also in the image at right shows alternative usages having equal production costs in political science an analogous method is used in understanding coalitions for example the diagram in laver and shepsle's work23 in population dynamics an isocline shows the set of population sizes at which the rate of change or partial derivative for one population in a pair of interacting populations is zero statisticsedit in statistics isodensity lines 24 or isodensanes are lines that join points with the same value of a probability density isodensanes are used to display bivariate distributions for example for a bivariate elliptical distribution the isodensity lines are ellipses thermodynamics engineering and other sciencesedit various types of graphs in thermodynamics engineering and other sciences use isobars constant pressure isotherms constant temperature isochors constant specific volume or other types of isolines even though these graphs are usually not related to maps such isolines are useful for representing more than two dimensions or quantities on two-dimensional graphs common examples in thermodynamics are some types of phase diagrams isoclines are used to solve ordinary differential equations in interpreting radar images an isodop is a line of equal doppler velocity and an isoecho is a line of equal radar reflectivity other phenomenaedit historyedit the idea of lines that join points of equal value was rediscovered several times the oldest known isobath contour line of constant depth is found on a map dated 1584 of the river spaarne near haarlem by dutchman pieter bruinsz.25 in 1701 edmond halley used such lines isogons on a chart of magnetic variation.26 the dutch engineer nicholas cruquius drew the bed of the river merwede with lines of equal depth isobaths at intervals of 1 fathom in 1727 and philippe buache used them at 10-fathom intervals on a chart of the english channel that was prepared in 1737 and published in 1752 such lines were used to describe a land surface contour lines in a map of the duchy of modena and reggio by domenico vandelli in 1746 and they were studied theoretically by ducarla in 1771 and charles hutton used them in the schiehallion experiment in 1791 a map of france by j l dupain-triel used contour lines at 20-metre intervals hachures spot-heights and a vertical section in 1801 the chief of the corps of engineers haxo used contour lines at the larger scale of 1:500 on a plan of his projects for rocca d'aufo.272829 by around 1843 when the ordnance survey started to regularly record contour lines in great britain and ireland they were already in general use in european countries isobaths were not routinely used on nautical charts until those of russia from 1834 and those of britain from 1838.273031 when maps with contour lines became common the idea spread to other applications perhaps the latest to develop are air quality and noise pollution contour maps which first appeared in the united states in approximately 1970 largely as a result of national legislation requiring spatial delineation of these parameters in 2007 pictometry international was the first to allow users to dynamically generate elevation contour lines to be laid over oblique images graphical designedit to maximize readability of contour maps there are several design choices available to the map creator principally line weight line color line type and method of numerical marking line weight is simply the darkness or thickness of the line used this choice is made based upon the least intrusive form of contours that enable the reader to decipher the background information in the map itself if there is little or no content on the base map the contour lines may be drawn with relatively heavy thickness also for many forms of contours such as topographic maps it is common to vary the line weight and/or color so that a different line characteristic occurs for certain numerical values for example in the topographic map above the even hundred foot elevations are shown in a different weight from the twenty foot intervals line color is the choice of any number of pigments that suit the display sometimes a sheen or gloss is used as well as color to set the contour lines apart from the base map line colour can be varied to show other information line type refers to whether the basic contour line is solid dashed dotted or broken in some other pattern to create the desired effect dotted or dashed lines are often used when the underlying base map conveys very important or difficult to read information broken line types are used when the location of the contour line is inferred numerical marking is the manner of denoting the arithmetical values of contour lines this can be done by placing numbers along some of the contour lines typically using interpolation for intervening lines alternatively a map key can be produced associating the contours with their values if the contour lines are not numerically labeled and adjacent lines have the same style with the same weight color and type then the direction of the gradient cannot be determined from the contour lines alone however if the contour lines cycle through three or more styles then the direction of the gradient can be determined from the lines the orientation of the numerical text labels is often used to indicate the direction of the slope plan view versus profile viewedit most commonly contour lines are drawn in plan view or as an observer in space would view the earth's surface ordinary map form however some parameters can often be displayed in profile view showing a vertical profile of the parameter mapped some of the most common parameters mapped in profile are air pollutant concentrations and sound levels in each of those cases it may be important to analyze air pollutant concentrations or sound levels at varying heights so as to determine the air quality or noise health effects on people at different elevations for example living on different floor levels of an urban apartment in actuality both plan and profile view contour maps are used in air pollution and noise pollution studies labeling contour mapsedit labels are a critical component of elevation maps a properly labeled contour map helps the reader to quickly interpret the shape of the terrain if numbers are placed close to each other it means that the terrain is steep labels should be placed along a slightly curved line pointing to the summit or nadir from several directions if possible making the visual identification of the summit or nadir easy.3233 contour labels can be oriented so a reader is facing uphill when reading the label manual labeling of contour maps is a time-consuming process however there are a few software systems that can do the job automatically and in accordance with cartographic conventions called automatic label placement see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

thermal radiation thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of charged particles in matter all matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation when the temperature of a body is greater than absolute zero inter-atomic collisions cause the kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules to change this results in charge-acceleration and/or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation and the wide spectrum of radiation reflects the wide spectrum of energies and accelerations that occur even at a single temperature sunlight is part of thermal radiation generated by the hot plasma of the sun the earth also emits thermal radiation but at a much lower intensity and different spectral distribution infrared rather than visible because it is cooler the earth's absorption of solar radiation followed by its outgoing thermal radiation have been held to be the two most important processes that determine the temperature and climate of the earth in most climate models however radiant-heat trapping by freely convective gases has never been demonstrated experimentally1 thermal radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer  contents  overviewedit thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero.4 it represents a conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy thermal energy consists of the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter all matter with a temperature by definition is composed of particles which have kinetic energy and which interact with each other these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles i.e. protons and electrons and kinetic interactions among matter particles result in charge-acceleration and dipole-oscillation this results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields resulting in the emission of photons radiating energy away from the body through its surface boundary electromagnetic radiation including light does not require the presence of matter to propagate and travels in the vacuum of space infinitely far if unobstructed the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface it is emanating from including its temperature its spectral absorptivity and spectral emissive power as expressed by kirchhoff's law.4 the radiation is not monochromatic i.e. it does not consist of just a single frequency but comprises a continuous dispersion of photon energies its characteristic spectrum if the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths it is characterized as a black body a black body is also a perfect emitter the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation the ratio of any body's emission relative to that of a black body is the body's emissivity so that a black body has an emissivity of unity surface effectsedit lighter colors and also whites and metallic substances absorb less illuminating light and thus heat up less but otherwise color makes small difference as regards heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings since the dominant emitted wavelengths are nowhere near the visible spectrum but rather in the far infrared emissivities at those wavelengths have little to do with visual emissivities visible colors in the far infra-red most objects have high emissivities thus except in sunlight the color of clothing makes little difference as regards warmth likewise paint color of houses makes little difference to warmth except when the painted part is sunlit the main exception to this is shiny metal surfaces which have low emissivities both in the visible wavelengths and in the far infrared such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions an example of this is the multi-layer insulation used to insulate spacecraft low-emissivity windows in houses are a more complicated technology since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light nanostructures with spectrally selective thermal emittance properties offer numerous technological applications for energy generation and efficiency e.g. for cooling photovoltaic cells and buildings these applications require high emittance in the frequency range corresponding to the atmospheric transparency window in 8 to 13 micron wavelength range a selective emitter radiating strongly in this range is thus exposed to the clear sky enabling the use of the outer space as a very low temperature heat sink personalized cooling technology is another example of an application where optical spectral selectivity can be beneficial conventional personal cooling is typically achieved through heat conduction and convection however the human body is a very efficient emitter of ir radiation which provides additional cooling mechanism most conventional fabrics are opaque to ir radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment fabrics for personalized cooling applications have been proposed that enable ir transmission to directly pass through clothing while being opaque at visible wavelengths fabrics that are transparent in the infrared can radiate body heat at rates that will significantly reduce the burden on power-hungry air-conditioning systems propertiesedit there are four main properties that characterize thermal radiation in the limit of the far field near-field and far-fieldedit the general properties of thermal radiation as described by the planck's law apply if the linear dimension of all parts considered as well as radii of curvature of all surfaces are large compared with the wavelength of the ray considered typically from 8-25 micrometres for the emitter at 300 k indeed thermal radiation as discussed above takes only radiating waves far-field or electromagnetic radiation into account a more sophisticated framework involving electromagnetic theory must be used for smaller distances from the thermal source or surface near-field thermal radiation for example although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent near-field thermal radiation i.e. radiation at distances of a fraction of various radiation wavelengths may exhibit a degree of both temporal and spatial coherence.5 planck's law of thermal radiation has been challenged in recent decades by predictions and successful demonstrations of the radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanoscale gaps that deviate significantly from the law predictions this deviation is especially strong up to several orders in magnitude when the emitter and absorber support surface polariton modes that can couple through the gap separating cold and hot objects however to take advantage of the surface-polariton-mediated near-field radiative heat transfer the two objects need to be separated by ultra-narrow gaps on the order of microns or even nanometers this limitation significantly complicates practical device designs another way to modify the object thermal emission spectrum is by reducing the dimensionality of the emitter itself this approach builds upon the concept of confining electrons in quantum wells wires and dots and tailors thermal emission by engineering confined photon states in two and three-dimensional potential traps including wells wires and dots such spatial confinement concentrates photon states and enhances thermal emission at select frequencies to achieve the required level of photon confinement the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by planck's law most importantly the emission spectrum of thermal wells wires and dots deviates from planck's law predictions not only in the near field but also in the far field which significantly expands the range of their applications subjective color to the eye of a black body thermal radiatoredit selected radiant heat fluxesedit interchange of energyedit thermal radiation is one of the principal mechanisms of heat transfer it entails the emission of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation due to an object's temperature other mechanisms are convection and conduction the interplay of energy exchange by thermal radiation is characterized by the following equation if objects appear white reflective in the visual spectrum they are not necessarily equally reflective and thus non-emissive in the thermal infrared most household radiators are painted white but this is sensible given that they are not hot enough to radiate any significant amount of heat and are not designed as thermal radiators at all  they are actually convectors and painting them matt black would make little difference to their efficacy acrylic and urethane based white paints have 93 blackbody radiation efficiency at room temperature10 meaning the term black body does not always correspond to the visually perceived color of an object these materials that do not follow the black color  high emissivity/absorptivity caveat will most likely have functional spectral emissivity/absorptivity dependence calculation of radiative heat transfer between groups of object including a 'cavity or 'surroundings requires solution of a set of simultaneous equations using the radiosity method in these calculations the geometrical configuration of the problem is distilled to a set of numbers called view factors which give the proportion of radiation leaving any given surface that hits another specific surface these calculations are important in the fields of solar thermal energy boiler and furnace design and raytraced computer graphics to reduce the heat transfer from a surface such as a glass window a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can be placed on the interior of the surface low-emittance low-e coatings are microscopically thin virtually invisible metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the u-factor by suppressing radiative heat flow.13 by adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window radiative poweredit or in terms of wavelength this type of theoretical model with frequency-independent emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body is often known as a grey body for frequency-dependent emissivity the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence though in general there is no simple expression for it practically speaking if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integral constantsedit definitions of constants used in the above equations variablesedit definitions of variables with example values radiative heat transferedit the net radiative heat transfer from one surface to another is the radiation leaving the first surface for the other minus that arriving from the second surface formulas for radiative heat transfer can be derived for more particular or more elaborate physical arrangements such as between parallel plates

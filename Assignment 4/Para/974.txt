degree angle a degree in full a degree of arc arc degree or arcdegree usually denoted by  the degree symbol is a measurement of a plane angle defined so that a full rotation is 360 degrees  contents  historyedit the original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown one theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year.5 ancient astronomers noticed that the sun which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day some ancient calendars such as the persian calendar used 360 days for a year the use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers another theory is that the babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system.67 the earliest trigonometry used by the babylonian astronomers and their greek successors was based on chords of a circle a chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity one sixtieth of this using their standard sexagesimal divisions was a degree aristarchus of samos and hipparchus seem to have been among the first greek scientists to exploit babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically.89 timocharis aristarchus aristillus archimedes and hipparchus were the first greeks known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes.10 eratosthenes used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts the division of the circle into 360 parts also occurred in ancient india as evidenced in the rigveda:11 twelve spokes one wheel navels three who can comprehend thison it are placed togetherthree hundred and sixty like pegsthey shake not in the least another motivation for choosing the number 360 may have been that it is readily divisible 360 has 24 divisorsnote 1 making it one of only 7 numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors sequence a072938 in the oeis.1213 furthermore it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7.note 2 this property has many useful applications such as dividing the world into 24 time zones each of which is nominally 15 of longitude to correlate with the established 24-hour day convention finally it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play according to that theory the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above subdivisionsedit the older system of thirds fourths etc. which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision was used by al-kashi and other ancient astronomers but is rarely used today these subdivisions were denotedcitation needed by writing the roman numeral for the number of sixtieths in superscript 1i for a prime minute of arc 1ii for a second 1iii for a third 1iv for a fourth etc hence the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc and the word second also refer to this system.citation needed alternative unitsedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

fog fog consists of visible cloud water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air at or near the earth's surface.1 fog can be considered a type of low-lying cloud and is heavily influenced by nearby bodies of water topography and wind conditions in turn fog has affected many human activities such as shipping travel and warfare  contents  definitionedit the term fog is typically distinguished from the more generic term cloud in that fog is low-lying and the moisture in the fog is often generated locally such as from a nearby body of water like a lake or the ocean or from nearby moist ground or marshes.2 formationedit fog begins to form when water vapor condenses into tiny liquid water droplets suspended in the air six examples of ways that water vapor is added to the air are by wind convergence into areas of upward motion;6 precipitation or virga falling from above;7 daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land;8 transpiration from plants;9 cool or dry air moving over warmer water;10 and lifting air over mountains.11 water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds.1213 fog like its elevated cousin stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.14 fog normally occurs at a relative humidity near 100%.15 this occurs from either added moisture in the air or falling ambient air temperature.15 however fog can form at lower humidities and can sometimes fail to form with relative humidity at 100% at 100 relative humidity the air cannot hold additional moisture thus the air will become supersaturated if additional moisture is added fog can form suddenly and can dissipate just as rapidly the sudden formation of fog is known as flash fog.16 fog commonly produces precipitation in the form of drizzle or very light snow drizzle occurs when the humidity of fog attains 100 and the minute cloud droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets.17 this can occur when the fog layer is lifted and cooled sufficiently or when it is forcibly compressed from above by descending air drizzle becomes freezing drizzle when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point the thickness of a fog layer is largely determined by the altitude of the inversion boundary which in coastal or oceanic locales is also the top of the marine layer above which the air mass is warmer and drier the inversion boundary varies its altitude primarily in response to the weight of the air above it which is measured in terms of atmospheric pressure the marine layer and any fogbank it may contain will be squashed when the pressure is high and conversely may expand upwards when the pressure above it is lowering typesedit fog can form in a number of ways depending on how the cooling that caused the condensation occurred radiation fog is formed by the cooling of land after sunset by infrared thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky the cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction causing the air temperature to fall below the dew point forming fog in perfect calm the fog layer can be less than a meter thick but turbulence can promote a thicker layer radiation fogs occur at night and usually doesn't last long after sunrise but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter examples of this phenomenon include the tule fog.18 ground fog is fog that obscures less than 60 of the sky and does not extend to the base of any overhead clouds.19 however the term is usually a synonym for radiation fog which is very shallow in some cases the depth of the fog is on the order of tens of centimeters over certain kinds of terrain with the absence of wind advection fog occurs when moist air passes over a cool surface by advection wind and is cooled.20 it is common as a warm front passes over an area with significant snow-pack it is most common at sea when moist air encounters cooler waters including areas of cold water upwelling such as along the california coast see san francisco fog a strong enough temperature difference over water or bare ground can also cause advection fog although strong winds often mix the air and can disperse fragment or prevent many kinds of fog markedly warmer and humid air blowing over a snowpack can continue to generate advection fog at elevated velocities up to 50 mph/80 km/h or more - this fog will be in a turbulent rapidly moving and comparatively shallow layer observed as inches/a few cm in depth over flat farm fields flat urban terrain and the like and/or form more complex forms where the terrain is different such as rotating areas in the lee of hills or large buildings and so on the advection of fog along the california coastline is propelled onto land by one of several processes a cold front can push the marine layer coast-ward an occurrence most typical in the spring or late fall during the summer months a low pressure trough produced by intense heating inland creates a strong pressure gradient drawing in the dense marine layer also during the summer strong high pressure aloft over the desert southwest usually in connection with the summer monsoon produces a south to southeasterly flow which can drive the offshore marine layer up the coastline a phenomenon known as a southerly surge typically following a coastal heat spell however if the monsoonal flow is sufficiently turbulent it might instead break up the marine layer and any fog it may contain moderate turbulence will typically transform a fog bank lifting it and breaking it up into shallow convective clouds called stratocumulus evaporation fog or steam fog forms over bodies of water overlain by much colder air this situation can also lead to steam devils forming lake effect fog is of this type sometimes in combination with other causes like radiation fog it tends to differ from most advective fog formed over land in that it is like lake-effect snow a convective phenomenon resulting in fog which can be quite a bit denser deeper and looks fluffy from above most other fog is stratiform steam devils which look like their dust counterparts are often seen in this situation frontal fog forms near a front when raindrops falling from relatively warm air above a frontal surface evaporate into cooler air close to the earth's surface and cause it to become saturated ice fog forming in very low temperatures can be the result of other mechanisms mentioned here as well as the exhalation of moist warm air by herds of animals it can be associated with the diamond dust form of precipitation in which very small crystals of ice form and slowly fall this often occurs during blue sky conditions which can cause many types of halos and other results of refraction of sunlight by the airborne crystals freezing fog which deposits rime is composed of droplets of supercooled water which freezes to surfaces on contact precipitation fog or frontal fog forms as precipitation falls into drier air below the cloud the liquid droplets evaporate into water vapor the water vapor cools and at the dewpoint it condenses and fog forms hail fog sometimes occurs in the vicinity of significant hail accumulations due to decreased temperature and increased moisture leading to saturation in a very shallow layer near the surface it most often occurs when there is a warm humid layer atop the hail and when wind is light this ground fog tends to be localized but can be extremely dense and abrupt it may form shortly after the hail falls when the hail has had time to cool the air and as it absorbs heat when melting and evaporating.21 upslope fog forms when moist air is going up the slope of a mountain or hill which condenses into fog on account of adiabatic cooling and to a lesser extent the drop in pressure with altitude freezing conditionsedit freezing fog occurs when liquid fog droplets freeze to surfaces forming white soft or hard rime.22 this is very common on mountain tops which are exposed to low clouds it is equivalent to freezing rain and essentially the same as the ice that forms inside a freezer which is not of the frostless or frost-free type the term freezing fog may also refer to fog where water vapor is super-cooled filling the air with small ice crystals similar to very light snow it seems to make the fog tangible as if one could grab a handful morning freezing fog in elko nevada pogonip fog in virginia city nevada from an early 20th-century postcard tree in field during extreme cold with frozen fog topographical influencesedit up-slope fog or hill fog forms when winds blow air up a slope called orographic lift adiabatically cooling it as it rises and causing the moisture in it to condense this often causes freezing fog on mountaintops where the cloud ceiling would not otherwise be low enough valley fog forms in mountain valleys often during winter it is essentially a radiation fog confined by local topography and can last for several days in calm conditions in california's central valley valley fog is often referred to as tule fog sea and coastal fogedit sea fog also known as haar or fret is heavily influenced by the presence of sea spray and microscopic airborne salt crystals clouds of all types require minute hygroscopic particles upon which water vapor can condense over the ocean surface the most common particles are salt from salt spray produced by breaking waves except in areas of storminess the most common areas of breaking waves are located near coastlines hence the greatest densities of airborne salt particles are there condensation on salt particles has been observed to occur at humidities as low as 70% thus fog can occur even in relatively dry air in suitable locations such as the california coast typically such lower humidity fog is preceded by a transparent mistiness along the coastline as condensation competes with evaporation a phenomenon that is typically noticeable by beachgoers in the afternoon another recently discovered source of condensation nuclei for coastal fog is kelp seaweed researchers have found that under stress intense sunlight strong evaporation etc. kelp releases particles of iodine which in turn become nuclei for condensation of water vapor causing fog that diffuses direct sunlight.27 sea smoke also called steam fog or evaporation fog is the most localized form and is created by cold air passing over warmer water or moist land.22 it often causes freezing fog or sometimes hoar frost arctic sea smoke is similar to sea smoke but occurs when the air is very cold instead of condensing into water droplets columns of freezing rising and condensing water vapor is formed the water vapor produces the sea smoke fog and is usually misty and smoke-like.28 fog rolls into seattle from the sea sea fog or fret encroaching on brighton pier sea fog in the arctic ocean near the island of jan mayen visibility effectsedit depending on the concentration of the droplets visibility in fog can range from the appearance of haze to almost zero visibility many lives are lost each year worldwide from accidents involving fog conditions on the highways including multiple-vehicle collisions the aviation travel industry is affected by the severity of fog conditions even though modern auto-landing computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff safe operations are difficult in thick fog and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve a solution for landing returning military aircraft developed in world war ii was called fog investigation and dispersal operation fido it involved burning enormous amounts of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft the high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations shadowsedit shadows are cast through fog in three dimensions the fog is dense enough to be illuminated by light that passes through gaps in a structure or tree but thin enough to let a large quantity of that light pass through to illuminate points further on as a result object shadows appear as beams oriented in a direction parallel to the light source these voluminous shadows are created the same way as crepuscular rays which are the shadows of clouds in fog it is solid objects that cast shadows sound propagation and acoustic effectsedit sound typically travels fastest and farthest through solids then liquids then gases such as the atmosphere sound is affected during fog conditions due to the small distances between water droplets and air temperature differences molecular effect though fog is essentially liquid water the many droplets are separated by small air gaps high-pitched sounds have a high frequency which in turn means they have a short wavelength to transmit a high frequency wave air must move back and forth very quickly short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets partially cancelling and dissipating their energy a process called damping in contrast low pitched notes with a low frequency and a long wavelength move the air less rapidly and less often and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone.30 temperature effect a fog can be caused by a temperature inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog while warmer air sits above it the inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface a temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer.31 record extremesedit the foggiest place in the worldcitation needed is hamilton new zealand followed closely by the grand banks off the coast of newfoundland the meeting place of the cold labrador current from the north and the much warmer gulf stream from the south some of the foggiest land areas in the world include argentia newfoundland and point reyes california each with over 200 foggy days per year.citation needed even in generally warmer southern europe thick fog and localized fog are often found in lowlands and valleys such as the lower part of the po valley and the arno and tiber valleys in italy ebro valley in northeastern spain as well as on the swiss plateau especially in the seeland area in late autumn and winter.citation needed other notably foggy areas include coastal chile in the south coastal namibia nord greenland and the severnaya zemlya islands as a water sourceedit artificial fogedit artificial fog is man-made fog that is usually created by vaporizing a water and glycol-based or glycerine-based fluid the fluid is injected into a heated metal block and evaporates quickly the resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent upon coming into contact with cool outside air the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog.33 such fog machines are primarily used for entertainment applications historical referencesedit the presence of fog has often played a key role in historical events such as strategic battles one example is the battle of long island august 27 1776 when american general george washington and his command were able to evade imminent capture by the british army using fog to conceal their escape another example is d-day june 6 1944 during world war ii when the allies landed on the beaches of normandy france during fog conditions both positive and negative results were reported from both sides during that battle due to impaired visibility.34  galleryedit maple tree with red leaves in the morning mist in western estonia fog hovering over the valleys

galveston texas during the 19th century galveston became a major u.s commercial center and one of the largest ports in the united states it was for a time texas largest city known as the queen city of the gulf it was devastated by the 1900 galveston hurricane whose effects included flooding and a storm surge the natural disaster on the exposed barrier island is still ranked as the deadliest in united states history with an estimated death toll of 6000 to 12000 people the city subsequently emerged during the prohibition era as a leading tourist hub and one of the most infamous centers of gambling this era ended in the 1950s  contents  historyedit exploration and 19th century developmentedit the island's first permanent european settlements were constructed around 1816 by the pirate louis-michel aury to support mexico's rebellion against spain.7 in 1817 aury returned from an unsuccessful raid against spain to find galveston occupied by the pirate jean lafitte.7 lafitte organized galveston into a pirate kingdom he called campeche anointing himself the island's head of government.8 lafitte remained in galveston until 1821 when the united states navy forced him and his raiders off the island.89 in 1839 the city of galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the congress of the republic of texas.1314 the city was by then a burgeoning port of entry and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of german immigrants to texas including jewish merchants.15 together with ethnic mexican residents these groups tended to oppose slavery support the union during the civil war and join the republican party after the war during this expansion the city had many firsts in the state with the founding of institutions and adoption of inventions post office 1836 naval base 1836 texas chapter of a masonic order 1840 cotton compress 1842 catholic parochial school ursuline academy 1847 insurance company 1854 and gas lights 1856.1316 during the american civil war confederate forces under major general john b magruder attacked and expelled occupying union troops from the city in january 1863 in the battle of galveston.17 in 1867 galveston suffered a yellow fever epidemic 1800 people died in the city.18 these occurred in waterfront and river cities throughout the 19th century as did cholera epidemics the city's progress continued through the reconstruction era with numerous firsts construction of the opera house 1870 and orphanage 1876 and installation of telephone lines 1878 and electric lights 1883.13161920 having attracted freedmen from rural areas in 1870 the city had a black population that totaled 300021 made up mostly of former slaves but also by persons who were free men of color and educated before the war the blacks comprised nearly 25 of the city's population of 13818 that year.22 during the post-civil-war period leaders such as george t ruby and norris wright cuney who headed the texas republican party and promoted civil rights for freedmen helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in galveston and in texas.2324 cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs galveston was a cosmopolitan city and one of the more successful during reconstruction the freedmen's bureau was headquartered here german families sheltered teachers from the north and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read its business community promoted progress and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry.25 by the end of the 19th century the city of galveston had a population of 37000 its position on the natural harbor of galveston bay along the gulf of mexico made it the center of trade in texas it was one of the nation's largest cotton ports in competition with new orleans.26 throughout the 19th century the port city of galveston grew rapidly and the strand was considered the region's primary business center for a time the strand was known as the wall street of the south.27 in the late 1890s the government constructed fort crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries in galveston and along the bolivar roads in february 1897 the uss texas nicknamed old hoodoo the first commissioned battleship of the united states navy visited galveston during the festivities the ship's officers were presented with a $5000 silver service adorned with various texas motifs as a gift from the state's citizens hurricane of 1900 and recoveryedit the city developed the city commission form of city government known as the galveston plan to help expedite recovery.30 despite attempts to draw investment to the city after the hurricane galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity development was also hindered by the construction of the houston ship channel which brought the port of houston into competition with the natural harbor of the port of galveston for sea traffic to further her recovery and rebuild her population galveston actively solicited immigration through the efforts of rabbi henry cohen and congregation b'nai israel galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the galveston movement that between 1907 and 1914 diverted roughly 10000 eastern european jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the northeastern united states.31 additionally numerous other immigrant groups including greeks italians and russian jews came to the city during this period.32 this immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island as well as many other areas of texas and the western u.s though the storm stalled economic development and the city of houston developed as the region's principal metropolis galveston economic leaders recognized the need to diversify from the traditional port-related industries in 1905 william lewis moody jr and isaac h kempner members of two of galveston's leading families founded the american national insurance company.33 two years later moody established the city national bank which would become the moody national bank.3435 during the 1920s and 1930s the city re-emerged as a major tourist destination.3637 under the influence of sam maceo and rosario maceo the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in clubs like the balinese room which offered entertainment to wealthy houstonians and other out-of-towners combined with prostitution which had existed in the city since the civil war galveston became known as the sin city of the gulf.38 galvestonians accepted and supported the illegal activities often referring to their island as the free state of galveston.3940 the island had entered what would later become known as the open era.41 the 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the island city during world war ii the galveston municipal airport predecessor to scholes international airport was re-designated a u.s army air corps base and named galveston army air field in january 1943 galveston army air field was officially activated with the 46th bombardment group serving an anti-submarine role in the gulf of mexico in 1942 william lewis moody jr. along with his wife libbie shearn rice moody established the moody foundation to benefit present and future generations of texans. the foundation one of the largest in the united states would play a prominent role in galveston during later decades helping to fund numerous civic and health-oriented programs.42 the end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of las vegas nevada as a competitive center of gambling and entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island.43 finally in 1957 texas attorney general will wilson and the texas rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted gambling and prostitution in the city.44 as these vice industries crashed so did tourism taking the rest of the galveston economy with it.45 neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward.46 the island's economy began a long stagnation many businesses relocated off the island during this period however health care insurance and financial industries continue to be strong contributors to the economy by 1959 the city of houston had long out-paced galveston in population and economic growth beginning in 1957 the galveston historical foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings.47 the 1966 book the galveston that was helped encourage the preservation movement restoration efforts financed by motivated investors notably houston businessman george p mitchell gradually developed the strand historic district and reinvented other areas a new family-oriented tourism emerged in the city over many years with the 1960s came the expansion of higher education in galveston already home to the university of texas medical branch the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the texas maritime academy predecessor of texas a&m university at galveston and by 1967 a community college galveston college had been established.48 in the 2000s property values rose after expensive projects were completed 49 and demand for second homes by the wealthy increased it has made it difficult for middle-class workers to find affordable housing on the island.50 after the storm the island was rebuilt with investments in tourism shipping and continued emphasis on higher education and health care notably the addition of the galveston island historic pleasure pier and the replacement of the bascule-type drawbridge on the railroad causeway with a vertical-lift-type drawbridge to allow heavier freight.5253

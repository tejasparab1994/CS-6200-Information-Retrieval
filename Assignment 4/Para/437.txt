on living marine resources such as seagrasses marshes reefs and fish center for coastal monitoring and assessment ccma15edit conducts field research and data analysis to support marine resource management at local regional and national levels center for sponsored coastal ocean research cscor16edit administers nccos extramural research  a portfolio of 11 programs consisting of 73 multi-year awards held by over 370 university state and government scientists and managers cooperative oxford laboratory col17edit the cooperative oxford laboratory col research mission is to combine the unique scientific response and management capabilities of noaa the maryland department of natural resources and u.s coast guard to identify and evaluate actions and policies that will protect restore and secure the health of the chesapeake bay and other threatened coastal marine ecosystems hollings marine laboratory hml18edit the hollings marine laboratory studies the complex interaction between marine environments aquatic organisms and their connections to human health the research required to address the interactions requires an interdisciplinary approach that our partnership fosters office of coast surveyedit office for coastal managementedit established in 2014 when noaa combined two offices the coastal services center and the office of ocean and coastal resource management in addition to implementing specific initiatives a top priority for noaa's office for coastal management is to unify efforts to make communities more resilient many organizations are involved including the private sector nonprofits the scientific community and all levels of government the office for coastal management works to be a unifying force in these efforts providing unbiased noaa data and tools and providing opportunities for the community to come together to define common goals and find ways to work smarter by working together issues run the gamut from protecting endangered species to erosion to generating better building codes for storm-resistant buildings.7 the ocm has four programs coastal zone managementedit coral reef conservation program crcpedit noaa's coral reef conservation program crcp is a cross-cutting program that brings together expertise from a wide array of noaa programs and offices in strong partnership with coral reef managers the crcp works to reduce harm to and restore the health of coral reefs including deep-water corals by addressing priority national threats and local management priorities through conservation activities the crcp was established in 2000 to help fulfill noaa's responsibilities under the coral reef conservation act of 2000 crca and the presidential executive order 13089 on coral reef protection the goal of the crcp is to protect conserve and restore coral reef resources by maintaining healthy ecosystem function the primary objective of the crcp is to address strategic coral reef management needs in a targeted cost-effective and efficient manner crcp funds and equips reef conservation activities by noaa and its partners in the seven u.s states and jurisdictions containing coral reefs american samoa the

low earth orbit  contents  orbital characteristicsedit goce orbited at about 255 km and had an aerodynamic shape and ion thrusters to reduce and compensate for atmospheric drag equatorial low earth orbits eleo are a subset of leo these orbits with low inclination to the equator allow rapid revisit times and have the lowest delta-v requirement i.e. fuel spend of any orbit orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called polar orbits higher orbits include medium earth orbit meo sometimes called intermediate circular orbit ico and further above geostationary orbit geo orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation use of leoedit although the earth's pull due to gravity in leo is not much less than on the surface of the earth people and objects in orbit experience weightlessness because they are in free fall a low earth orbit is simplest and cheapest for satellite placement it provides high bandwidth and low communication time lag latency but satellites in leo will not be visible from any given point on the earth at all times.5 examplesedit space debrisedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

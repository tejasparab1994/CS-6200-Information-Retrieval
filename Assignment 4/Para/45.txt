atlantic hurricane an atlantic hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in the atlantic ocean usually in the summer or fall a hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only on the basis of location.1 a hurricane is a storm that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian ocean.1 in recent times tropical disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a predetermined list hurricanes that result in significant damage or casualties may have their names retired from the list at the request of the affected nations in order to prevent confusion should a subsequent storm be given the same name.5 on average in the north atlantic basin from 1966 to 2009 11.3 named storms occur each season with an average of 6.2 becoming hurricanes and 2.3 becoming major hurricanes category 3 or greater.6 the climatological peak of activity is around september 11 each season.6  contents  steering factorsedit in the tropical latitudes tropical storms and hurricanes generally move westward with a slight tendency toward the north under the influence of the subtropical ridge a high pressure system that usually extends east-west across the subtropics.8 south of the subtropical ridge surface easterly winds blowing from east to west prevail if the subtropical ridge is weakened by an upper trough a tropical cyclone may turn poleward and then recurve9 or curve back toward the northeast into the main belt of the westerlies poleward north of the subtropical ridge westerly winds prevail and generally steer tropical cyclones that reach northern latitudes toward the east the westerlies also steer extratropical cyclones with their cold and warm fronts from west to east.10 intensityedit climatologyedit seasonal variationedit juneedit julyedit not much tropical activity occurs during the month of july but the majority of hurricane seasons see the formation of one tropical cyclone during july from an average of atlantic tropical cyclone seasons from 1944 to 1996 the first tropical storm in half of the seasons occurred by 11 july and a second formed by 8 august.6 formation usually occurs in the eastern caribbean sea around the lesser antilles in the northern and eastern parts of the gulf of mexico in the vicinity of the northern bahamas and off the coast of the carolinas and virginia over the gulf stream storms travel westward through the caribbean and then either move towards the north and curve near the eastern coast of the united states or stay on a north-westward track and enter the gulf of mexico.11 augustedit decrease in wind shear from july to august contributes to a significant increase of tropical activity.46 an average of 2.8 atlantic tropical storms develop annually in august on average four named tropical storms including one hurricane occur by august 30 and the first intense hurricane develops by 4 september.6 septemberedit the peak of the hurricane season occurs in september and corresponds with low wind shear46 and the warmest sea surface temperatures.47 the month of september sees an average of 3 storms a year by 24 september the average atlantic season features 7 named tropical storms including 4 hurricanes in addition two major hurricanes occur on average by 28 september relatively few tropical cyclones make landfall at these intensities.6 octoberedit the favorable conditions found during september begin to decay in october the main reason for the decrease in activity is increasing wind shear although sea surface temperatures are also cooler than in september.40 activity falls markedly with 1.8 cyclones developing on average despite a climatological secondary peak around 20 october.48 by 21 october the average season features 9 named storms with 5 hurricanes a third major hurricane occurs after 28 september in half of all atlantic tropical cyclone seasons.6 in contrast to mid-season activity the mean locus of formation shifts westward to the caribbean and gulf of mexico reversing the eastward progression of june through august.11 novemberedit wind shear from westerlies increases substantially through november generally preventing cyclone formation.40 on average one tropical storm forms during every other november on rare occasions a major hurricane occurs the few intense hurricanes in november include hurricane cuba in late october and early november 1932 the strongest november hurricane on record peaking as a category 5 hurricane hurricane lenny in mid-november 1999 hurricane kate in late november 1985 which was the latest major hurricane formation on record until hurricane otto a category 3 storm of the 2016 hurricane season.11 hurricane paloma was a very potent category 4 storm that made landfall in cuba in early november 2008 december to mayedit tropical cyclones have formed in all months.42 four tropical cyclones existed during the month of january two of which formed during late december the second hurricane alice in 1954/1955 and tropical storm zeta in 2005/2006 the only two hurricanes to form in january are a category 1 hurricane in the 1938 season and hurricane alex in the 2016 season a subtropical storm in january also began the 1978 atlantic hurricane season.11 no major hurricanes have occurred in the off-season.52 extremesedit trendsedit often in part because of the threat of hurricanes many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism therefore the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances the combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes therefore experts regard the early data as suspect.64 christopher landsea et al estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 these undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones the density of shipping tracks over the atlantic basin and the amount of populated coastline.65 these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the atlantic basin before the satellite era began in 1960 tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one a ship reported a voyage through the storm or a storm landed in a populated area.64 the official record therefore could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale-force winds recognized it as a tropical storm as opposed to a high-latitude extra-tropical cyclone a tropical wave or a brief squall returned to port and reported the experience see alsoedit notesedit

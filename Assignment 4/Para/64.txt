rain rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then becomes heavy enough to fall under gravity rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the earth it provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation the major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts if enough moisture and upward motion is present precipitation falls from convective clouds those with strong upward vertical motion such as cumulonimbus thunder clouds which can organize into narrow rainbands in mountainous areas heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains on the leeward side of mountains desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass the movement of the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone brings rainy seasons to savannah climes rain is also known or suspected on other planets where it may be composed of methane neon sulfuric acid or even iron rather than water  contents  formation water-saturated air there are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point adiabatic cooling conductive cooling radiational cooling and evaporative cooling adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands.7 the air can rise due to convection large-scale atmospheric motions or a physical barrier such as a mountain orographic lift conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface8 usually by being blown from one surface to another for example from a liquid water surface to colder land radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation either by the air or by the surface underneath.9 evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature or until it reaches saturation.10 the main ways water vapor is added to the air are wind convergence into areas of upward motion11 precipitation or virga falling from above12 daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans water bodies or wet land13 transpiration from plants14 cool or dry air moving over warmer water15 and lifting air over mountains.16 water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust ice and salt in order to form clouds elevated portions of weather fronts which are three-dimensional in nature17 force broad areas of upward motion within the earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus.18 stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass it can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.19 coalescence and fragmentation coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary when air turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets as these larger water droplets descend coalescence continues so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing and is also known as the warm rain process.20 in clouds below freezing when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall this generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets this process is temperature dependent as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing in addition because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.21 rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops.26 intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related i.e. high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.2728 droplet size distribution deviations can occur for small droplets and during different rainfall conditions the distribution tends to fit averaged rainfall while instantaneous size spectra often deviate and have been modeled as gamma distributions.31 the distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation.23 raindrop impacts rain falling on loosely packed material such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples that can be fossilized.33 the air density dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints has been used to constrain the density of the air 2.7 billion years ago.34 the sound of raindrops hitting water is caused by bubbles of air oscillating underwater.3536 the metar code for rain is ra while the coding for rain showers is shra.37 virga in certain conditions precipitation may fall from a cloud but then evaporate or sublime before reaching the ground this is termed virga and is more often seen in hot and dry climates causes frontal activity convection convective rain or showery precipitation occurs from convective clouds e.g. cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus it falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective however it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.3842 graupel and hail indicate convection.43 in mid-latitudes convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts squall lines and warm fronts.44 orographic effects orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation in mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds for example the trade winds a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side moisture is removed by orographic lift leaving drier air see katabatic wind on the descending and generally warming leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.16 in south america the andes mountain range blocks pacific moisture that arrives in that continent resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western argentina.48 the sierra nevada range creates the same effect in north america forming the great basin and mojave deserts.4950 within the tropics the wet or rainy season is the time of year covering one or more months when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls.51 the term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities.52 areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.53 savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.54 some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season.27 when the wet season occurs during the warm season or summer rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours the wet season is a time when air quality improves55 freshwater quality improves5657 and vegetation grows significantly tropical cyclones a source of very heavy rainfall consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction southern hemisphere or counter clockwise northern hemisphere.58 although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.59 areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.60 human influence analysis of 65 years of united states of america rainfall records show the lower 48 states have an increase in heavy downpours since 1950 the largest increases are in the northeast and midwest which in the past decade have seen 31 and 16 percent more heavy downpours compared to the 1950s rhode island is the state with the largest increase 104% mcallen texas is the city with the largest increase 700% heavy downpour in the analysis are the days where total precipitation exceeded the top 1 percent of all rain and snow days during the years 1950-20146566 the most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding which include techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains and suppress hail.67 characteristics patterns rainbands are cloud and precipitation areas which are significantly elongated rainbands can be stratiform or convective68 and are generated by differences in temperature when noted on weather radar imagery this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure.69 rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion70 and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.71 rainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes.72 rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the front's orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet.73 bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries if enough moisture is present if sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front they can mask the location of the cold front itself.74 once a cyclone occludes a trough of warm air aloft or trowal for short will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast and ultimately northwestern periphery also known as the warm conveyor belt forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front the trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head due to the comma-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature it can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection.75 banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain.76 behind extratropical cyclones during fall and winter rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the great lakes downwind of islands bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges offshore california this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.77 rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that together with the eyewall and the eye constitute a hurricane or tropical storm the extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.78 acidity the phrase acid rain was first used by scottish chemist robert augus smith in 1852.79 the ph of rain varies especially due to its origin on america's east coast rain that is derived from the atlantic ocean typically has a ph of 5.0-5.6 rain that comes across the continental from the west has a ph of 3.8-4.8 and local thunderstorms can have a ph as low as 2.0.80 rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids sulfuric acid h2so4 and nitric acid hno3 sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes and wetlands sulfate reducing bacteria and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels and mining where h2s is present nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning soil bacteria and natural fires while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants in the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium most likely as ammonia from livestock production which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the ph.81 an oceanic or maritime climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents bordering cool oceans as well as southeastern australia and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.87 the mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the mediterranean basin parts of western north america parts of western and south australia in southwestern south africa and in parts of central chile the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and cool wet winters.88 a steppe is a dry grassland.89 subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.90 measurement gauges rain is measured in units of length per unit time typically in millimeters per hour91 or in countries where imperial units are more common inches per hour.92 the length or more accurately depth being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time typically an hour.93 one millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter.94 when a precipitation measurement is made various networks exist across the united states and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the internet such as cocorahs or globe.99100 if a network is not available in the area where one lives the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the measurement.101 remote sensing one of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for hydrological purposes.102 for instance river flood control sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration to produce radar accumulations rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points a radar equation is then used which is where z represents the radar reflectivity r represents the rainfall rate and a and b are constants.103 satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive microwave instruments aboard polar orbiting as well as geostationary weather satellites to indirectly measure rainfall rates.104 if one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time intensity rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation euphemisms for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer trash-mover and toad-strangler.107 the intensity can also be expressed by rainfall erosivity r-factor108 return period forecasting impact effect on agriculture precipitation especially rain has a dramatic effect on agriculture all plants need at least some water to survive therefore rain being the most effective means of watering is important to agriculture while a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants too much or too little rainfall can be harmful even devastating to crops drought can kill crops and increase erosion118 while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth.119 plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive for example certain cacti require small amounts of water120 while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive in areas with wet and dry seasons soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.27 animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season as the crops have yet to mature.121 developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest which occurs late in the wet season.122 rain may be harvested through the use of rainwater tanks treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation.123 excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.124 in culture cultural attitudes towards rain differ across the world in temperate climates people tend to be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy with its impact greater on men than women.125 rain can also bring joy as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it in dry places such as india126 or during periods of drought127 rain lifts people's moods in botswana the setswana word for rain pula is used as the name of the national currency in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country since it has a desert climate.128 several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats and diversion devices such as gutters and storm drains that lead rains to sewers.129 many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive the source of this scent is petrichor an oil produced by plants then absorbed by rocks and soil and later released into the air during rainfall.130 global climatology deserts polar desert since rain only falls as liquid in frozen temperatures rain cannot fall as a result very cold climates see very little rainfall and are often known as polar deserts a common biome in this area is the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter ice caps see no rain at all making antarctica the world's driest continent rainforests rainforests are areas of the world with very high rainfall both tropical and temperate rainforests exist tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude but they are often found in other areas around 40-75 of all biotic life is found in rainforests rainforests are also responsible for 28 of the world's oxygen turnover monsoons impact of the westerlies wettest known locations outside earth see also notes references external links navigation menu personal tools

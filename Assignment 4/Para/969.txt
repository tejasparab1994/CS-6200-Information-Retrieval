volume volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface for example the space that a substance solid liquid gas or plasma or shape occupies or contains.1 volume is often quantified numerically using the si derived unit the cubic metre the volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container i e. the amount of fluid gas or liquid that the container could hold rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes volumes of some simple shapes such as regular straight-edged and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary where a variance in shape and volume occurs such as those that exist between different human beings these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the body volume index one-dimensional figures such as lines and two-dimensional shapes such as squares are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space the volume of a solid whether regularly or irregularly shaped can be determined by fluid displacement displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas the combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances however sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not additive.2 in differential geometry volume is expressed by means of the volume form and is an important global riemannian invariant in thermodynamics volume is a fundamental parameter and is a conjugate variable to pressure  contents  unitsedit in the international system of units si the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre m3 the metric system also includes the litre l as a unit of volume where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube thus so small amounts of liquid are often measured in millilitres where various other traditional units of volume are also in use including the cubic inch the cubic foot the cubic mile the teaspoon the tablespoon the fluid ounce the fluid dram the gill the pint the quart the gallon the minim the barrel the cord the peck the bushel and the hogshead related termsedit the density of an object is defined as the ratio of the mass to the volume.5 the inverse of density is specific volume which is defined as volume divided by mass specific volume is a concept important in thermodynamics where the volume of a working fluid is often an important parameter of a system being studied volume in calculusedit in calculus a branch of mathematics the volume of a region d in r3 is given by a triple integral of the constant functionfxyz1displaystyle fxyz=1 and is usually written as the volume integral in cylindrical coordinates is volume formulasedit volume ratios for a cone sphere and cylinder of the same radius and heightedit let the radius be r and the height be h which is 2r for the sphere then the volume of cone is the volume of the sphere is while the volume of the cylinder is volume formula derivationsedit sphereedit the volume of a sphere is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally small circular disks of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius r is as follows the radius of the circular disks defined such that the x-axis cuts perpendicularly through them is or where y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x value using y as the disk radius the volume of the sphere can be calculated as now coneedit the cone is a type of pyramidal shape the fundamental equation for pyramids one-third times base times altitude applies to cones as well however using calculus the volume of a cone is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular disks of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a cone of height h whose base is centered at 0 0 0 with radius r is as follows the surface area of the circular disk is then the volume of the cone can then be calculated as and after extraction of the constants integrating gives us volume in differential geometryedit in differential geometry a branch of mathematics a volume form on a differentiable manifold is a differential form of top degree i.e. whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold that is nowhere equal to zero a manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable an orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form on non-orientable manifolds one may instead define the weaker notion of a density integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form an oriented pseudo-riemannian manifold has a natural volume form in local coordinates it can be expressed as where thedxidisplaystyle dx^i are 1-forms that form a positively oriented basis for the cotangent bundle of the manifold andgdisplaystyle g is the determinant of the matrix representation of the metric tensor on the manifold in terms of the same basis volume in thermodynamicsedit in thermodynamics the volume of a system is an important extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state the specific volume an intensive property is the system's volume per unit of mass volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature for example volume is related to the pressure

hurricane sandy general impact other wikis contents meteorological history forecasts on october 23 2012 the path of hurricane sandy was correctly predicted by the european centre for medium-range weather forecasts ecmwf headquartered in reading england nearly eight days in advance of its striking the american east coast the computer model noted that the storm would turn west towards land and strike the new york/new jersey region on october 29 rather than turn east and head out to the open atlantic as most hurricanes in this position do by october 27 four days after the ecmwf made its prediction the national weather service and national hurricane center confirmed the path of the hurricane predicted by the european model the national weather service was criticized for not employing its higher-resolution forecast models the way that its european counterpart did a hardware and software upgrade completed at the end of 2013 enabled the weather service to make more accurate predictions and do so far more in advance than the technology in 2012 had allowed.34 relation to global warming as they move north atlantic hurricanes typically are forced east and out to sea by the prevailing westerlies.38 in sandy's case this typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over greenland resulting in a negative north atlantic oscillation forming a kink in the jet stream causing it to double back on itself off the east coast sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow.38 the blocking pattern over greenland also stalled an arctic front which combined with the cyclone.38 mark fischetti of scientific american said that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by the melting of arctic ice.39 trenberth said that while a negative north atlantic oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.36 sea level at new york and along the new jersey coast has increased by nearly

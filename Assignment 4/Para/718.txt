convair cv-240 family the convair cv-240 is an american airliner produced by convair from 1947 to 1954 initially as a possible replacement of the ubiquitous douglas dc-3 featuring a more modern design with cabin pressurization the 240 series was able to make some inroads as a commercial airliner and also had a long development cycle which resulted in various civil and military variants although reduced in numbers through attrition the convairliners in various forms continue to fly into the 21st century.1  contents  design and developmentedit the design began its life in a requirement by american airlines for an airliner to replace its douglas dc-3s convair's original design the unpressurised model 110 was a twin-engine low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction with 30 seats it was powered by pratt  whitney r-2800 double wasp radial engines and had a tricycle landing gear and a ventral airstair for passenger boarding.2 the prototype model 110 registration nx90653 first flew on july 8 1946.2 by this time american had changed its requirements to require pressurization and deemed the design too small the first prototype was used by convair for development work for the 240 series before being broken up in 1947.3 the model 240 was followed by the model 340 that had a longer fuselage longer-span wings and more powerful engines the 340 first flew on october 5 1951.6 in 1954 in an attempt to compete with turboprop-powered airliners like the vickers viscount convair produced the model 440 metropolitan with more streamlined cowlings new engine exhausts and better soundproofing for the cabin.7 as the super 240 evolved into the cv-340 and cv-440 the limit of piston-engine performance was reached and future development centered on conversion to turboprop power.1 operational historyedit the first delivery of a production convairliner was to american on february 29 1948.5 a total of 75 were delivered to american with another 50 going to western airlines continental airlines pan american airways klm swissair sabena and trans australia airlines.8 a cv-240 was the first private aircraft used in a united states presidential campaign in 1960 john f kennedy used a cv-240 named caroline after his daughter during his campaign this aircraft is now preserved in the national air and space museum after aborted negotiations with twa and eastern for super 240 orders the production of the 240 series was temporarily halted in response to a united inquiry convair redesigned the super 240 calling it the cv-340 united ordered 55 and more us orders came from braniff continental delta northeast and national other orders came from abroad and the cv-340 proved popular in south america the cv-340 earned an enviable reputation for reliability and profitability and was developed into the cv-440 metropolitan the final piston-engined variant of the convairliners.1 kelowna flightcraft air charter the major remaining operator of this model currently holds the type certificate for this aircraft variantsedit data from general dynamics aircraft and their predecessors1 civil variantsedit military variantsedit operatorsedit civil operatorsedit africaedit asiaedit australasiaedit europeedit united states and canadaedit mexico the caribbean central and south americaedit military operatorsedit other operatorsedit accidents and incidentsedit specifications cv-240edit data from general dynamics aircraft and their predecessors43 general characteristics performance see alsoedit referencesedit notesedit bibliographyedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

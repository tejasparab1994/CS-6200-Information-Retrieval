polar vortex when the polar vortex is strong there is a single vortex with a jet stream that is well constrained near the polar front when the northern vortex weakens it separates into two or more vortices the strongest of which are near baffin island canada and the other over northeast siberia.2 the antarctic vortex of the southern hemisphere is a single low pressure zone that is found near the edge of the ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude when the polar vortex is strong the mid-latitude westerlies winds at the surface level between 30 and 60 latitude from the west increase in strength and are persistent when the polar vortex is weak high pressure zones of the mid latitudes may push poleward moving the polar vortex jet stream and polar front equatorward the jet stream is seen to buckle and deviate south this rapidly brings cold dry air into contact with the warm moist air of the mid latitudes resulting in a rapid and dramatic change of weather known as a cold snap.3 ozone depletion occurs within the polar vortices  particularly over the southern hemisphere  reaching a maximum depletion in the spring  contents  historyedit the phenomenon was mentioned frequently in the news and weather media in the cold north american winter of 2013-2014 popularizing the term as an explanation of very cold temperatures.6 identificationedit duration and poweredit polar vortices are weakest during summer and strongest during winter extratropical cyclones that migrate into higher latitudes when the polar vortex is weak can disrupt the single vortex creating smaller vortices cold-core lows within the polar air mass.11 those individual vortices can persist for more than a month.8 volcanic eruptions in the tropics can lead to a stronger polar vortex during winter for as long as two years afterwards.12 the strength and position of the polar vortex shapes the flow pattern in a broad area about it an index which is used in the northern hemisphere to gauge its magnitude is the arctic oscillation.13 the waxing and waning of the polar vortex is driven by the movement of mass and the transfer of heat in the polar region in the autumn the circumpolar winds increase in speed and the polar vortex rises into the stratosphere the result is the polar air forms a coherent rotating air mass the polar vortex as winter approaches the vortex core cools the winds decrease and the vortex energy declines once late winter and early spring approach the vortex is at its weakest as a result during late winter large fragments of the vortex air can be diverted into lower latitudes by stronger weather systems intruding from those latitudes in the lowest level of the stratosphere strong potential vorticity gradients remain and the majority of that air remains confined within the polar air mass into december in the southern hemisphere and april in the northern hemisphere well after the breakup of the vortex in the mid-stratosphere.15 the breakup of the northern polar vortex occurs between mid march to mid may this event signifies the transition from winter to spring and has impacts on the hydrological cycle growing seasons of vegetation and overall ecosystem productivity the timing of the transition also influences changes in sea ice ozone air temperature and cloudiness early and late polar breakup episodes have occurred due to variations in the stratospheric flow structure and upward spreading of planetary waves from the troposphere.clarification needed as a result of increased waves into the vortex the vortex experiences more rapid warming than normal resulting in an earlier breakup and spring when the breakup comes early it is characterized by with persistent of remnants of the vortex when the breakup is late the remnants dissipate rapidly when the breakup is early there is one warming period from late february to middle march when the breakup is late there are two warming periods one january and one in march zonal mean temperature wind and geopotential height exert varying deviations from their normal values before and after early breakups while the deviations remain constant before and after late breakups scientists are connecting a delay in the arctic vortex breakup with a reduction of planetary wave activities few stratospheric sudden warming events and depletion of ozone.1617clarification needed climate changeedit a study in 2001 found that stratospheric circulation can have anomalous effects on weather regimes.29 in the same year researchers found a statistical correlation between weak polar vortex and outbreaks of severe cold in the northern hemisphere.3031 in more recent years scientists identified interactions with arctic sea ice decline reduced snow cover evapotranspiration patterns nao anomalies or weather anomalies which are linked to the polar vortex and jet stream configuration.2931323334353637 however because the specific observations are considered short-term observations starting c 13 years ago there is considerable uncertainty in the conclusions climatology observations require several decades to definitively distinguish natural variability from climate trends.citation needed the general assumption is that reduced snow cover and sea ice reflect less sunlight and therefore evaporation and transpiration increases which in turn alters the pressure and temperature gradient of the polar vortex causing it to weaken or collapse this becomes apparent when the jet stream amplitude increases meanders over the northern hemisphere causing rossby waves to propagate farther to the south or north which in turn transports warmer air to the north pole and polar air into lower latitudes the jet stream amplitude increases with a weaker polar vortex hence increases the chance for weather systems to become blocked a recent blocking event emerged when a high-pressure over greenland steered hurricane sandy into the northern mid-atlantic states.38 ozone

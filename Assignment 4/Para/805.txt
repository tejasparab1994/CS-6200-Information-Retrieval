president nixon visited the biloxi-gulfport regional airport and gave a speech to elevate the spirits of local residents struggling with the storm's aftermath during the rebuilding process stricter building codes were enforced by local governments in 1973 hurricane hunters and their associated reconnaissance aircraft relocated to keesler air force base when their previous headquarters at ramey puerto rico closed.10 the devastation of camille inspired the implementation of the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after the storm many gulf coast residents commented that hurricane warnings were not clear enough in conveying the expected intensity of the coming storm the saffir-simpson scale offered a much more concise statement of storm intensity than barometric pressure and wind-speed measurements and veterans of previous hurricanes could analogize the power of the approaching storm to those they had experienced.42 in a 1999 report on hurricane camille sponsored by the noaa coastal services center the authors concluded with camille the preparations for the event and the response were based on processes put in place long before the storm made landfall coordination between government agencies as well as with state and local officials was enhanced because of preexisting plans.40 one small compensation was that recovery from flood damage in nelson county virginia led to the discovery of the ginger gold apple in the orchards of clyde harvey.43 retirementedit due to the major destruction and death in much of the southern united states the name camille was retired after the 1969 season44 and will never again be used for an atlantic or gulf hurricane or tropical storm the name cindy was scheduled to replace the name in 197345 although a new ten-year list of names was created for the 1972-1980 atlantic hurricane seasons.46 comparisons to hurricane katrinaedit although hurricane camille and hurricane katrina took different paths they both reached the same section of the coast of mississippi with similar destructive effects camille intensified more rapidly than katrina and unlike katrina camille re-intensified a second time and maintained status as a category 5 hurricane until landfall both hurricanes shared the common aspect of undergoing periods of rapid intensification.47 the size of camille's radius of maximum wind was less than one-third that of katrina more similar to the intense but small hurricane andrew also unlike katrina camille caused little damage in new orleans louisiana though camille itself just barely missed the city.48 the area of hurricane-force winds within camille was just over two-thirds the size of hurricane katrina both storms were moving at a similar forward motion at the time of landfall although camille's wind speed at landfall was higher katrina's storm surge exceeded camille's storm surge at all known locations due to its greater size.49 both hurricanes names were retired due to the time period between the two hurricanes along with the approximate same landfall locations sizes and intensities of the two storms katrina had been nicknamed camille's deadly daughter. in cultureedit filmsedit musicedit

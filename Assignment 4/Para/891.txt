orbital inclination orbital inclination measures the tilt of an object's orbit around a celestial body it is expressed as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting object  contents  orbitsedit the inclination is one of the six orbital elements describing the shape and orientation of a celestial orbit it is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of reference normally stated in degrees for a satellite orbiting a planet the plane of reference is usually the plane containing the planet's equator for planets in the solar system the plane of reference is usually the ecliptic the plane in which the earth orbits the sun.12 this reference plane is most practical for earth-based observers therefore earth's inclination is by definition zero inclination could instead be measured with respect to another plane such as the sun's equator or the invariable plane the plane that represents the angular momentum of the solar system approximately the orbital plane of jupiter most planetary orbits in the solar system have relatively small inclinations both in relation to each other and to the sun's equator natural and artificial satellitesedit the inclination of orbits of natural or artificial satellites is measured relative to the equatorial plane of the body they orbit if they orbit sufficiently closely the equatorial plane is the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the central body exoplanets and multiple star systemsedit the inclination of exoplanets or members of multiple stars is the angle of the plane of the orbit relative to the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight from earth to the object since the word 'inclination is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin-orbit angle or spin-orbit alignment in most cases the orientation of the star's rotational axis is unknown if the orbit is almost edge-on then the planet can be seen transiting its star other meaningedit for planets and other rotating celestial bodies the angle of the equatorial plane relative to the orbital plane  such as the tilt of the earth's poles toward or away from the sun  is sometimes also called inclination but less ambiguous terms are axial tilt or obliquity calculationedit in astrodynamics the inclination i can be computed from the orbital momentum vector h or any vector perpendicular to the orbital plane as where hz is the z-component of h mutual inclination of two orbits may be calculated from their inclinations to another plane using cosine rule for angles see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

earth earth is the third planet from the sun and the only object in the universe known to harbor life according to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence earth formed over 4 billion years ago.242526 earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space especially the sun and the moon earth's only natural satellite earth revolves around the sun in 365.26 days a period known as an earth year during this time earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.n 5 earth's axis of rotation is tilted producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface.27 the gravitational interaction between the earth and moon causes ocean tides stabilizes the earth's orientation on its axis and gradually slows its rotation.28 earth is the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years about 71 of earth's surface is covered with water mostly by oceans.29 the remaining 29 is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere the majority of earth's polar regions are covered in ice including the antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the arctic ice pack earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core a liquid outer core that generates the earth's magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics  contents  name and etymology originally earth was written in lowercase and from early middle english its definite sense as the globe was expressed as the earth by early modern english many nouns were capitalized and the earth became and often remained the earth particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies more recently the name is sometimes simply given as earth by analogy with the names of the other planets.39 house styles now vary oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common with the capitalized form an acceptable variant another convention capitalizes earth when appearing as a name e.g earth's atmosphere but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the e.g the atmosphere of the earth it almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as what on earth are you doing?50 chronology formation geological history origin of life and evolution future physical characteristics shape in geodesy the exact shape that earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid more precisely the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level chemical composition the most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides chlorine sulfur and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1% over 99 of the crust is composed of 11 oxides principally silica alumina iron oxides lime magnesia potash and soda.99100101 internal structure heat tectonic plates the mechanically rigid outer layer of earth the lithosphere is divided into pieces called tectonic plates these plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries convergent boundaries at which two plates come together divergent boundaries at which two plates are pulled apart and transform boundaries in which two plates slide past one another laterally earthquakes volcanic activity mountain-building and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries.116 the tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.117 surface the continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite less common is basalt a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.126 sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together nearly 75 of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks although they form about 5 of the crust.127 the third form of rock material found on earth is metamorphic rock which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures high temperatures or both the most abundant silicate minerals on earth's surface include quartz feldspars amphibole mica pyroxene and olivine.128 common carbonate minerals include calcite found in limestone and dolomite.129 hydrosphere about 97.5 of the water is saline the remaining 2.5 is fresh water most fresh water about 68.7% is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.138 atmosphere weather and climate water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere when atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm humid air this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.151 most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes this water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods precipitation patterns vary widely ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter atmospheric circulation topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.154 this latitudinal rule has several anomalies upper atmosphere thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from earth's gravity this causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.164 the leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.165 hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on earth.166 in the current oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape instead most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.167 gravitational field magnetic field magnetosphere the extent of earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere to about 10 earth radii and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.172 because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.173 charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as earth rotates;174175 the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field176 and the van allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.172177 during magnetic storms and substorms charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail directed along field lines into earth's ionosphere where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized causing the aurora.178 orbit and rotation rotation orbit axial tilt and seasons above the arctic circle an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year up to six months at the north pole itself a polar night in the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed with the south pole oriented opposite the direction of the north pole six months later this pole will experience a midnight sun a day of 24 hours again reversing with the south pole a study from 2016 suggested that planet nine tilted all solar system planets including earth's by about 6 degrees.194 habitability biosphere in july 2016 scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor luca of all organisms living on earth.198 natural resources and land use earth has resources that have been exploited by humans those termed non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels only renew over geological timescales large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from earth's crust consisting of coal petroleum and natural gas these deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis resulting from actions of magmatism erosion and plate tectonics.200 these bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements natural and environmental hazards large areas of earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones hurricanes or typhoons that dominate life in those areas from 1980 to 2000 these events caused an average of 11800 human deaths per year.203 many places are subject to earthquakes landslides tsunamis volcanic eruptions tornadoes sinkholes blizzards floods droughts wildfires and other calamities and disasters many localized areas are subject to human-made pollution of the air and water acid rain and toxic substances loss of vegetation overgrazing deforestation desertification loss of wildlife species extinction soil degradation soil depletion and erosion there is a scientific consensus linking human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions this is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets more extreme temperature ranges significant changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels.204 human geography cartography the study and practice of map-making and geography the study of the lands features inhabitants and phenomena on earth have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting earth surveying the determination of locations and distances and to a lesser extent navigation the determination of position and direction have developed alongside cartography and geography providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information independent sovereign nations claim the planet's entire land surface except for some parts of antarctica a few land parcels along the danube river's western bank and the unclaimed area of bir tawil between egypt and sudan as of 2015update there are 193 sovereign states that are member states of the united nations plus two observer states and 72 dependent territories and states with limited recognition.14 earth has never had a sovereign government with authority over the entire globe although some nation-states have striven for world domination and failed.212 the united nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations thereby avoiding armed conflict.213 the u.n serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law when the consensus of the membership permits it provides a mechanism for armed intervention.214 moon the moon is a relatively large terrestrial planet-like natural satellite with a diameter about one-quarter of earth's it is the largest moon in the solar system relative to the size of its planet although charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet pluto the natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as moons after earth's the gravitational attraction between earth and the moon causes tides on earth the same effect on the moon has led to its tidal locking its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit earth as a result it always presents the same face to the planet as the moon orbits earth different parts of its face are illuminated by the sun leading to the lunar phases the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator the moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the moon.28 some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the sun and planets to earth's equatorial bulge the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years as appears to be the case for mars.223 viewed from earth the moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the sun the angular size or solid angle of these two bodies match because although the sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the moon's it is also 400 times more distant.186 this allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on earth the most widely accepted theory of the moon's origin the giant-impact hypothesis states that it formed from the collision of a mars-size protoplanet called theia with the early earth this hypothesis explains among other things the moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of earth's crust.224 asteroids and artificial satellites earth has at least five co-orbital asteroids including 3753 cruithne and 2002 aa29.225226 a trojan asteroid companion 2010 tk7 is librating around the leading lagrange triangular point l4 in the earth's orbit around the sun.227228 as of june 2016update there were 1419 operational human-made satellites orbiting earth.5 there are also inoperative satellites including vanguard 1 the oldest satellite currently in orbit and over 16000 pieces of tracked space debris.n 3 earth's largest artificial satellite is the international space station cultural and historical viewpoint the standard astronomical symbol of earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle 230 representing the four corners of the world human cultures have developed many views of the planet earth is sometimes personified as a deity in many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity231 and by the mid-20th century the gaia principle compared earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability.232233234 creation myths in many religions involve the creation of earth by a supernatural deity or deities.231 scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet in the west belief in a flat earth235 was displaced by the idea of spherical earth credited to pythagoras in the 6th century bc.236 earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object comparable to the other planets in the solar system.237 due to the efforts of influential christian scholars and clerics such as james ussher who sought to determine the age of earth through analysis of genealogies in scripture westerners before the 19th century generally believed earth to be a few thousand years old at most it was only during the 19th century that geologists realized earth's age was at least many millions of years.238 see also notes references further

washington metro topological diagram of the whole system including extension under construction and the approved maryland purple line light rail which will be operationally separate from metro the washington metro known colloquially as metro and branded metrorail4 is the heavy rail rapid transit system serving the washington metropolitan area in the united states it is administered by the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata which also operates metrobus service under the metro name.5 besides the district of columbia metro serves several jurisdictions in the states of maryland and virginia in maryland metro provides service to montgomery and prince george's counties in virginia to arlington and fairfax counties and the independent city of alexandria combined with its ridership in the independent virginia cities of falls church and fairfax the metro service area is largely coextensive with the inner ring of the washington metropolitan area the system is currently being expanded to reach dulles international airport and loudoun county virginia it operates mostly as a subway in the district itself while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated metro is the third-busiest rapid transit system in the united states in number of passenger trips after the new york city subway and chicago l.1 there were 215.3 million trips on metro in fiscal year 2015 or 712843 trips per weekday.9 in june 2008 metro set a monthly ridership record with 19729641 trips or 798456 per weekday.10 fares vary based on the distance traveled the time of day and the type of card used by the passenger riders enter and exit the system using a proximity card called smartrip  contents  historyedit during the 1960s plans were laid for a massive freeway system in washington harland bartholomew who chaired the national capital planning commission thought that a rail transit system would never be self-sufficient because of low density land uses and general transit ridership decline.11 but the plan met fierce opposition and was altered to include a capital beltway system plus rail line radials the beltway received full funding funding for the ambitious inner loop freeway system was partially reallocated toward construction of the metro system.12 in 1960 the federal government created the national capital transportation agency to develop a rapid rail system in 1966 a bill creating wmata was passed by the federal government the district of columbia virginia and maryland6 with planning power for the system being transferred to it from the ncta.13 the highest ridership for a single day was on the day of the inauguration of barack obama january 20 2009 with 1120000 riders it broke the previous record set the day before of 866681 riders.25 june 2008 set several ridership records the single-month ridership record of 19729641 total riders the record for highest average weekday ridership with 1044400 weekday trips had five of the ten highest ridership days and had 12 weekdays in which ridership exceed 800000 trips.10 in february 2006 metro officials chose randi miller a car dealership employee from woodbridge virginia to record new doors opening doors closing and please stand clear of the doors thank you announcements after winning an open contest to replace the messages recorded by sandy carroll in 1996 the doors closing contest attracted 1259 contestants from across the country.26 on october 30 2010 the crowd at the rally to restore sanity and/or fear broke a 19-year record in saturday ridership with 825437 trips.27 the previous record had been set on june 8 1991 at 786358 trips during the desert storm rally.28 opening datesedit 29 architectureedit many metro stations were designed by chicago architect harry weese and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture with their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs metro stations display aspects of brutalist design the stations also reflect the influence of washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults weese worked with cambridge massachusetts-based lighting designer bill lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system.3031 all of metro's original brutalist stations are found in downtown washington d.c and neighboring urban corridors of arlington virginia while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.32 in 2007 the design of the metro's vaulted-ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the america's favorite architecture list compiled by the american institute of architects aia and was the only brutalist design to win a place among the 150 selected by this public survey in january 2014 the aia announced that it would present its twenty-five year award to the washington metro system for an architectural design of enduring significance that has stood the test of time by embodying architectural excellence for 25 to 35 years the announcement cited the key role of weese who conceived and implemented a common design kit-of-parts which continues to guide the construction of new metro stations over a quarter-century later albeit with designs modified slightly for cost reasons.33 intersection of coffered concrete ceiling vaults at metro center opened 1976 a major transfer station a train departs from mcpherson square station opened 1977 which has an original ceiling vault design canopy over entrance to l'enfant plaza opened 1977 echoes the arched ceiling underground woodley park station opened 1981 shows a modified ceiling vault shady grove opened 1984 is a typical original above-ground station spring hill opened 2014 is a typical newer above-ground station systemedit in an effort to gain revenues wmata has started to allow retail ventures in metro stations wmata has authorized dvd-rental vending machines and ticket booths for the old town trolley tours and is seeking additional retail tenants.37 financingedit metro relies extensively on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the maryland virginia and washington d.c governments which are represented on metro's board of directors the system does not have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities mass transit systems do critics allege that this has contributed to metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems.38 for fiscal year 2015 the estimated farebox recovery ratio fare revenue divided by operating expenses was 66 percent based on the wmata approved budget.39 infrastructureedit stationsedit the system is not centered on any single station but metro center is at the intersection of the red orange blue and silver lines.43 the station is also the location of wmata's main sales office metro has designated five other core stations that have high passenger volume including:44 gallery place transfer station for the red green and yellow lines l'enfant plaza transfer station for the orange blue silver green and yellow lines union station the busiest station by passenger boardings;43 farragut north and farragut west rolling stockedit note retirement dates are estimates for the 2000 3000 and 5000 series trains the 5000 series caf trains are expected to be retired in 2019 because of poor quality and unreliability.citation needed the 7000 series of cars currently being built by kawasaki heavy industries rolling stock company of kobe japan are being delivered for on-site testing during winter 2013 and first entered service april 14 2015 on the blue line the new cars are different from previous models in that while still operating as married pairs the cab in one car was eliminated turning it into a b car the new design allows for increased passenger capacity elimination of redundant equipment greater energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs the national transportation safety board investigation of the fatal june 22 2009 accident led it to conclude that the 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect passengers in a crash as a result on july 26 2010 metro voted to purchase 300 7000 series cars to replace the remaining 1000 series cars.5253 an additional 128 7000 series cars were also ordered to serve the new silver line to dulles airport 64 for each phase in may 2013 metro placed another order for 100 7000 series cars which will replace all of the 4000 series cars.54 on july 13 2015 wmata used their final option and purchased an additional 220 7000 series railcars for fleet expansion bringing the total number of 7000 series railcars on order to 748.55 signaling and operationedit during normal passenger operation on revenue tracks trains are designed to be controlled by an integrated automatic train operation ato and automatic train control atc system that accelerates and brakes trains automatically without operator intervention all trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors make station announcements and supervise their trains the system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.56 since june 2009 when two red line trains collided and killed nine people due in part to malfunctions in the atc system all metro trains have been manually operated.57 the current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks speed restrictions and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains increased dwell time and worse on-time performance.58 metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 201759 but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues.60 the train doors were originally designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them much as elevator doors do almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled at present the doors may be opened automatically or manually if a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction the operator must re-open the door hours and headwaysedit metrorail begins service at 5 am monday through friday 7 am on saturdays and 8 am sundays it ends service at 11:30 pm monday through thursday 1:00 am friday and saturday and 11:00 pm on sundays although the last trains leave the end stations inbound about half an hour before these times.61not in citation given trains run more frequently during rush hours on all lines with scheduled peak hour headways of 4 minutes on the red line and 9 minutes on all other lines headways are much longer during midday and evening on weekdays and all weekend the midday six-minute headways are based on a combination of two metrorail lines orange/blue and yellow/green as each route can run every 12 minutes in the case of the red line every other train bound for glenmont terminates at silver spring instead night and weekend service varies between 8 and 24 minutes with trains generally scheduled only every 20 minutes other service truncations also occur in the system during rush hour service only on the red line every other train bound for shady grove terminates at grosvenor-strathmore in addition to the alternating terminations at silver spring mentioned above for the yellow line all trains bound for fort totten terminate at mount vernon square these are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of rail cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system until 1999 metro ended service at midnight every night and weekend service began at 8 am that year wmata began late night service on fridays and saturdays until 1 am by 2007 with encouragement from businesses that closing time had been pushed back to 3 am62 with peak fares in effect for entries after midnight there were plans floated to end late night service due to costs in 2011 but they were met with resistance by riders.63 wmata temporarily discontinued late night rail service on may 30 2016 so that metro can conduct an extensive track rehabilitation program in an effort to improve the system's reliability.6465 special service patternsedit metro runs special service patterns on holidays and when events in washington may require additional service independence day activities require metro to adjust service to provide extra capacity to and from the national mall.69 wmata makes similar adjustments during other events such as presidential inaugurations metro has altered service and used some stations as entrances or exits only to help manage congestion.70 rush plusedit the rush realignment was intended to free up space in the rosslyn portal the tunnel between rosslyn and foggy bottom which operates at full capacity already when silver line service began those trains would be routed through the tunnel and so some of what were blue line trains to largo town center were now diverted across the fenwick bridge to become yellow line trains running all the way up the green line to greenbelt select yellow line trains running south diverted along the blue line to franconia-springfield as opposed to the normal yellow line terminus at huntington until the start of silver line service excess rosslyn tunnel capacity was used by additional orange line trains that traveled along the blue line to largo as opposed to the normal orange line terminus at new carrollton rush had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys though severely increasing headways for the portion of the blue line running between pentagon and rosslyn in may 2017 metro announced that yellow rush service would be eliminated effective june 25 2017.71 passenger information systemsedit a passenger information display system pids was installed in all metrorail stations in 2000 displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations and provide real-time information on next train arrivals delayed trains emergency announcements and related information.72 wmata also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices.73 in 2010 metro began sharing its pids data with outside software developers for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices free apps are available to the public on major mobile device software platforms ios android windows phone palm.7475 wmata also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.76 fare structureedit riders enter and exit the system using a stored-value card in the form of a proximity card known as smartrip the fare is deducted from the balance of the card when exiting.77 smartrip cards can be purchased at station vending machines online or at retail outlets and can store up to $300 in value passengers may purchase passes at farecard vending machines passes are loaded onto the same smartrip cards as stored value but grant riders unlimited travel within the system for a certain period of time the period of validity starts with the first use four types of passes are currently sold:8384 users can add value to any farecard riders pay an exit fare based on time of day and distance traveled trips may include segments on multiple lines under one fare as long as the rider does not exit the faregates with the exception of the farragut crossing out-of-station interchange between farragut west and farragut north stations at farragut crossing riders may exit from one station and reenter at the other within 30 minutes on a single fare when making a trip that uses metrobus and metrorail a 50 discount is available when using a smartrip card.9091 when entering and exiting at the same station users are normally charged a minimum fare $2.15  $1.75 however since july 1 2016 users have had a 15 minute grace period to exit the station those who do so will receive a rebate of the amount paid as an autoload to their smartrip card.9293 students at district of columbia public schools ride both metrobus and metrorail for free.94 fare historyedit the contract for metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to cubic transportation systems.95 electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on july 1 1977 a little more than a year after the first stations opened prior to electronic fare collection exact change fareboxes were used.96 metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by bay area rapid transit which cubic won a contract for in 1974.95 any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit and passes were printed with the expiration date several adjustments were made to shift the availability of passes from paper tickets to smartrip cards in 2012 and 2013 in may 2014 metro announced plans to retrofit more than 500 fare vending machines throughout the system to dispense smartrip cards rather than paper fare cards and eventually eliminate magnetic fare cards entirely.97 this was completed in early december 2015 when the last paper farecard was sold.98 the faregates stopped accepting paper farecards on march 6 201699100 and the last day for trading in farecards to transfer the value to smartrip was june 30 2016.100 safety and securityedit securityedit metro planners designed the system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations the open vaulted ceiling design of stations and the limited obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights metro's attempts to reduce crime combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind101 has contributed to metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the united states.102 there are nearly 6000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.103 each city and county in the metro service area has similar ordinances that regulate or prohibit vending on metro-owned property and which prohibit riders from eating drinking or smoking in metro trains buses and stations the transit police have a reputation for enforcing these laws rigorously one widely publicized incident occurred in october 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old ansche hedgepeth for eating french fries in the tenleytown-au station.105 in a 2004 opinion by john roberts now chief justice of the united states the d.c circuit court of appeals upheld hedgepeth's arrest.106 by then wmata had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles and arresting them only after three violations within a year metro's zero-tolerance policy on food trash and other sources of disorder embodies the broken windows philosophy of crime reduction this philosophy also extends to the use of station restroom facilities a longstanding policy intended to curb unlawful and unwanted activity has been to only allow employees to use metro restrooms.102 station managers may make exceptions for passengers with small children the elderly or the disabled.107 metro now allows the use of restrooms by passengers who gain a station manager's permission except during periods of heightened terror alerts.108 random bag searchesedit on october 27 2008 the metro transit police department announced plans to immediately begin random searches of backpacks purses and other bags transit police would search riders at random before boarding a bus or entering a station it also explained its intent to stop anyone acting suspiciously.109 metro claims that the united states court of appeals for the second circuit decision in macwade v kelly110 which upheld random searches on the new york city subway allows metro transit police to take similar action.111 metro transit police chief michael taborn stated that if someone were to turn around and simply enter the system through another escalator or elevator metro has a plan to address suspicious behavior.112 security expert bruce schneier characterized the plan as security theater against a movie plot threat and does not believe random bag searches actually improve security.113 in 2010 metro once again announced that it would implement random bag searches and conducted the first such searches on december 21 2010.115 the searches consist of swabbing bags and packages for explosive residue and x-raying or opening any packages which turned up positive on the first day of searches at least one false positive for explosives was produced which metro officials indicated could occur for a variety of reasons including if a passenger had recently been in contact with firearms or been to a firing range.116 the d.c bill of rights coalition and the montgomery county civil rights coalition circulated a petition against random bag searches taking the position that the practice violates the fourth amendment to the united states constitution and would not improve security.117 on january 3 2011 metro held a public forum for the searches at a metro riders advisory council meeting at which more than 50 riders spoke out most of them in opposition to the searches however at the meeting metro officials called random bag inspections a success and claimed that few riders had complained.118 after a prolonged absence as of february 2017update bag searches have resumed at random stations throughout the washington metro area safetyedit accidents and incidentsedit several collisions have occurred on washington metro resulting in injuries and fatalities along with numerous derailments with few or no injuries wmata has been criticized for disregarding safety warnings and advice from experts the tri-state oversight committee oversaw wmata but had no regulatory authority metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents but could not require other metro departments to implement its recommendations.119 following several safety lapses the federal transit administration assumed oversight at wmata.120 during the blizzard of 1996 on january 6 a metro operator was killed when a train failed to stop at the shady grove station the four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment the national transportation safety board ntsb investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system the ntsb recommended that metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system even in inclement weather and recommended that metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.121 on november 3 2004 an out-of-service red line train rolled backwards into the woodley park station hitting an in-service train stopped at the platform the rear car 1077 was telescoped by the first car of the standing train 4018 no one was killed but 20 people were injured.122 a 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station safety officials estimated that had the train been full at least 79 people would have died the train operator was dismissed and metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.123 on january 13 1982 a train derailed at a malfunctioning crossover switch south of the federal triangle station in attempting to restore the train to the rails supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed the other rail car slid off the track and hit a tunnel support killing three people and injuring 25 coincidentally this crash occurred about 30 minutes after air florida flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th street bridge during a major snowstorm.6 on january 20 2003 during construction of a new canopy at the national airport station metro began running trains through the center track even though it had not been constructed for standard operations and a blue line train derailed at the switch no injuries resulted but the crash delayed construction by a number of weeks.129 on january 7 2007 a green line train carrying approximately 120 people derailed near the mount vernon square station in downtown washington trains were single-tracking at the time and the derailment of the fifth car occurred where the train was switching from the south to northbound track the crash injured at least 18 people and prompted the rescue of 60 people from a tunnel.130 at least one person had a serious but non-life-threatening injury.131 the mount vernon square crash was one of a series of five derailments involving 5000-series cars with four of those occurring on side tracks and not involving passengers.131 on june 9 2008 an orange line train 2000-series derailed between the rosslyn and court house stations.132133 on july 6 2012 around 4:45 pm a green line train bound for downtown washington d.c and branch avenue derailed near west hyattsville no injuries were reported a heat kink due to the hot weather was identified as the probable cause of the accident.137 on august 6 2015 a non-passenger train derailed outside smithsonian station the track condition that caused the derailment had been detected a month earlier but was not repaired.138 on july 29 2016 a silver line train heading in the direction of wiehle-reston east station derailed outside east falls church station service was suspended between ballston and west falls church and mclean stations on the orange and silver lines.139 on september 1 2016 metro announced the derailment of an empty six-car train in the alexandria rail yard no injuries or service interruptions were reported and an investigation is ongoing.140 safety measuresedit on july 13 2009 wmata adopted a zero tolerance policy for train or bus operators found to be texting or using other hand-held devices while on the job this new and stricter policy came after investigations of several mass-transit accidents in the u.s found that operators were texting at the time of the accident the policy change was announced the day after a passenger of a metro train videotaped the operator texting while operating the train.141 on january 12 2015 during early evening rush a yellow line train stopped in the tunnel and filled with smoke just after departing l'enfant plaza for pentagon due to an electrical arcing event ahead in the tunnel everyone on board was evacuated 84 people were taken to hospitals and one person died.142 on march 14 2016 an electrified rail caught fire between mcpherson square and farragut west causing significant disruptions on the blue orange and silver lines on march 15 a decision was made to close the entire rail network the following day to inspect the network's entire electric rail power grid.143 future expansionedit wmata expects an average of one million riders daily by 2030 the need to increase capacity has renewed plans to add 220 cars to the system and reroute trains to alleviate congestion at the busiest stations.144 population growth in the region has also revived efforts to extend service build new stations and construct additional lines silver lineedit blue line realignmentedit orange line extensionedit the virginia department of transportation vdot announced on january 18 2008 that it and the virginia department of rail and public transportation drpt had begun work on a draft environmental impact statement eis for the i-66 corridor in fairfax and prince william counties according to vdot the eis officially named the i-66 multimodal transportation and environment study would focus on improving mobility along i-66 from the capital beltway i-495 interchange in fairfax county to the interchange with u.s route 15 in prince william county the eis also allegedly includes a four-station extension of the orange line past vienna the extension would continue to run in the i-66 median and would have stations at chain bridge road fair oaks stringfellow road and centreville near virginia route 28 and u.s route 29.153 in its final report published june 8 2012 the study and analysis revealed that an extension would have a minimal impact on metrorail ridership and volumes on study area roadways inside the beltway and would therefore not relieve congestion in the study corridor.154 fort belvoir and fort meade extensionsedit in 2005 the defense department announced that it would be shifting 18000 jobs to fort belvoir in virginia and at least 5000 jobs to fort meade in maryland by 2012 as part of that year's base realignment and closure plan in anticipation of such a move local officials and the military proposed extending the blue and green lines to service each base the proposed extension of the green line could cost $100 million per mile $60 million per kilometer and a light rail extension to fort belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.155156 potomac yard stationedit in 2008 officials began to explore the possibility of adding an infill station called potomac yard in the potomac yard area of alexandria on the blue and yellow lines between the national airport and braddock road stations in 2010 the alexandria city council approved a portion of the proposed $240 million construction of the station construction would start in 2017 and the station is expected to open in 2020.157 other new rail linesedit in 2011 metro began studying the needs of the system through 2040.152 new metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include a new line which parallels the capital beltway a new line from the friendship heights metro station to white oak maryland which would pass through the district and silver spring an extension of the green line to national harbor in maryland and re-routing the blue line in the district between the orange line and green line none of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction.152 related non-wmata projectsedit a number of light rail and urban streetcar projects have been proposed to extend or supplement service provided by metro like the silver line in virginia the proposed purple line has been in planning since the 1980s.158 the project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the metrorail system in a pattern roughly mirroring the capital beltway.159 the current proposal would create a light rail system in maryland between the bethesda and new carrollton stations by way of silver spring and college park such a plan would connect both branches of the red line to the green and orange lines and would decrease the travel time between suburban metro stations.158160 in 2005 a maryland lawmaker proposed a light rail system to connect areas of southern maryland especially the rapidly growing area around the town of waldorf to the branch avenue station on the green line.163 the district of columbia department of transportation is building the new d.c streetcar system to improve transit connectivity within the district a tram line to connect bolling air force base to the anacostia station and was originally expected to open in 2010 streetcar routes have been proposed in the atlas district capitol hill and the k street corridor.164 after seven years of construction the atlas district route known as the h/benning street route opened on february 27 2016.165 see alsoedit

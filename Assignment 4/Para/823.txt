convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence and hurricane hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior however andrew weakened as it continued further inland and after crossing southern florida in four hours the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 130 mph 210 km/h.1 in the gulf of mexico the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north.12 andrew steadily re-intensified over the gulf of mexico reaching winds of 145 mph 235 km/h late on august 25.7 as the high pressure system to its north weakened a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest this caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest and winds decreased as andrew approached the gulf coast of the united states.1 preparationsedit bahamasedit floridaedit gulf coast of the united statesedit shortly after the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico from

louisiana even a month prior to andrew the house committee on appropriations  which oversees the budget for fema  released a report calling the agency a political dumping ground and a turkey farm due to its weak inexperienced leaders congressman s william green of new york a member of the appropriations committee stated that he believed the agency learned little from its botched response to hurricane hugo in 1989 however green also criticized local officials for expecting them fema to come and run the whole show some fema officials responded that it was impossible to respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for the los angeles riots fema spokesman grant peterson stated 24 hours is not reasonable to expect to have all the resources of the federal government landing in the middle of a disaster.89 floridaedit louisianaedit see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more

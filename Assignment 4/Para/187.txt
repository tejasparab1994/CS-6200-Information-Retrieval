national hurricane center the national hurricane center nhc is the division of the united states national weather service responsible for tracking and predicting weather systems within the tropics between the prime meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean the agency which is co-located with the miami branch of the national weather service is situated on the campus of florida international university in university park florida.12 its tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb routinely issues marine forecasts in the form of graphics and high seas forecasts for this area year round with the ocean prediction center having backup responsibility for this unit the technology and science branch tsb provides technical support for the center which includes new infusions of technology from abroad the chief aerial reconnaissance coordination all hurricanes carcah unit tasks planes for research and operational purposes to tropical cyclones during the atlantic hurricane season and significant weather events including snow storms during winter and spring research to improve operational forecasts is done through the hurricane forecast improvement project hfip and joint hurricane test bed jht initiatives although the nhc is an agency of the united states the world meteorological organization has designated it as regional specialized meteorological center for the north atlantic and eastern pacific making it the clearinghouse for tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas if the center loses power or becomes incapacitated the central pacific hurricane center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast pacific ocean while the weather prediction center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the north atlantic ocean  contents  historyedit early historyedit the central office in washington which evolved into the national meteorological center and weather prediction center formally known as the hydrometeorological prediction center assumed hurricane warning/advisory responsibility at that time this responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935 and the concept of the atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.5 the jacksonville hurricane warning office moved to miami florida in 1943 tropical cyclone naming began for atlantic tropical cyclones using the joint army/navy phonetic alphabet by 1947.6 in 1950 the miami hurricane warning office began to prepare the annual hurricane season summary articles.7 in the 1953 atlantic season the united states weather bureau began naming storms which reach tropical storm intensity with human names.8 as the national hurricane centeredit beginning in 1973 the national meteorological center duties renamed the hydrometeorological prediction center renamed for a second time in 201326 gained advisory responsibility for tracking and publicizing inland tropical depressions the world meteorological organization assumed control of the atlantic hurricane naming list in 1977.27 in 1978 the nhc's offices moved off the campus of the university of miami across u.s highway 1 to the ire financial building.28 male names were added into the hurricane list beginning in the 1979 season.29 the hurricane warning offices remained active past 1983.30 in 1984 the nhc was separated from the miami weather service forecast office which meant the meteorologist in charge at miami was no longer in a position above the hurricane center director.31 by 1988 the nhc gained responsibility for eastern pacific tropical cyclones as the former eastern pacific hurricane center in san francisco was decommissioned.32 in 1992 hurricane andrew blew the wsr-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of nhc's/the miami state weather forecast offices.33 the radar was replaced with a wsr-88d nexrad system in april 1993 installed near metro zoo34 near where hurricane andrew made landfall organizationedit hurricane specialists unitedit known as the nhc from 1995 through 2010 the hurricane specialists within the hurricane specialists unit hsu are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms the specialists work rotating eight-hour shifts from may through november monitoring weather patterns in the atlantic and eastern pacific oceans whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms they issue advisories every six hours until the storm is over public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens land.43 the specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected they forecast and recommend watches and warnings.44 during the hurricane season the hsu routinely issues their tropical weather outlook product which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones if systems occur outside the defined hurricane season the hsu issues special tropical weather outlooks.45 backup responsibility for their northeast pacific area resides at the central pacific hurricane center cphc46 and vice versa if cphc were to have communication issues.47 north atlantic responsibilities are backed up by the weather prediction center wpc.40 routine coordination occurs at 1700 utc each day between the weather prediction center and national hurricane center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future.48 outside of the hurricane season the specialists concentrate on public education efforts.49 tropical analysis and forecast branchedit the tropical analysis and forecast branch tafb formerly the tropical satellite analysis and forecast unit and the tropical analysis center is a part of the national hurricane center and was created in 1967.50 the tafb is responsible for high seas analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the atlantic and pacific between the prime meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast pacific ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern atlantic ocean.51 unlike the hurricane specialists unit hsu tafb is staffed full-time around the year other responsibilities of the tafb include satellite-derived tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates wsr-88d radar fixes for tropical cyclones tropical cyclone forecast support media support and general operational support.52 the ocean prediction center backs up tafb in the event of a communications outage and vice versa.53 technology and science branchedit the technology  science branch tsb develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities tsb created and continues development of the automated tropical cyclone forecasting atcf system used to incorporate various data and model outputs create and update hurdat and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts the tsb provides support for nhc computer and communications systems including its website tsb maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions the storm surge unit which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones is part of this branch.44 the techniques development and applications unit tdau is part of tsb.54 carcahedit the chief aerial reconnaissance coordination all hurricanes carcah is a subunit of the 53d weather reconnaissance squadron hurricane hunters carcah's mission is to provide a point-of-contact and to coordinate all tropical cyclone operational reconnaissance requirements at nhc and the central pacific hurricane center for the north atlantic caribbean gulf of mexico and the north pacific basin east of the international date line in accordance with the national hurricane operations plan nhop during the winter carcah coordinates the atlantic and pacific winter storm requirements in support of the national winter storms operations plan nwsop missions are flown in advance of the high-impact weather events forecast to affect the u.s. such as heavy snowfall44 and at times when there is significant uncertainty within/between numerical weather prediction output.55 hltedit the hurricane liaison team hlt supports hurricane response through information exchange between the nhc the national weather service noaa/nws and the emergency management community the hlt is composed of federal state and local emergency managers as well as nws meteorologists and hydrologists who maintain open lines of communication about the progress and threat level of the storm with appropriate federal state and local officials the team establishes and facilitates video and/or teleconferences with the nhc fema and other federal agencies state emergency operations centers eocs weather prediction center hpc storm prediction center spc and river forecast centers rfcs.44 during significant landfalling hurricanes the president of the united states as well as affected city mayors and state governors join the daily briefing call which occurs at noon eastern daylight time.56 researchedit as part of their annual tropical cyclone activity the agency issues a report on every tropical cyclone in the atlantic and eastern pacific ocean basins which are available since 1958 and 1988 respectively the report summarizes the synoptic history meteorological statistics casualties and damages and the post-analysis best track of a storm.57 the reports were formally known as preliminary reports up until 1999.58 the agency maintains archives and climatological statistics on atlantic and pacific hurricane history including annual reports on every tropical cyclone a complete set of tropical cyclone advisories digitized copies of related materials on older storms season summaries published as the monthly weather review and hurdat which is the official tropical cyclone database.59 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools

mississippi river native americans long lived along the mississippi river and its tributaries most were hunter-gatherers but some such as the mound builders formed prolific agricultural societies the arrival of europeans in the 16th century changed the native way of life as first explorers then settlers ventured into the basin in increasing numbers.14 the river served first as a barrier forming borders for new spain new france and the early united states and then as a vital transportation artery and communications link in the 19th century during the height of the ideology of manifest destiny the mississippi and several western tributaries most notably the missouri formed pathways for the western expansion of the united states formed from thick layers of the river's silt deposits the mississippi embayment is one of the most fertile agricultural regions of the country which resulted in the river's storied steamboat era during the american civil war the mississippi's capture by union forces marked a turning point towards victory due to the river's importance as a route of trade and travel not least to the confederacy because of substantial growth of cities and the larger ships and barges that supplanted riverboats the first decades of the 20th century saw the construction of massive engineering works such as levees locks and dams often built in combination since modern development of the basin began the mississippi has also seen its share of pollution and environmental problems  most notably large volumes of agricultural runoff which has led to the gulf of mexico dead zone off the delta in recent years the river has shown a steady shift towards the atchafalaya river channel in the delta a course change would be an economic disaster for the port city of new orleans  contents  name and significanceedit the word itself comes from messipi the french rendering of the anishinaabe ojibwe or algonquin name for the river misi-ziibi great river in the 18th century the river was the primary western boundary of the young united states and since the country's expansion westward the mississippi river has been widely considered a convenient if approximate dividing line between the eastern southern and midwestern united states and the western united states this is exemplified by the gateway arch in st louis and the phrase trans-mississippi as used in the name of the trans-mississippi exposition it is common to qualify a regionally superlative landmark in relation to it such as the highest peak east of the mississippi15 or the oldest city west of the mississippi.16 the fcc also uses it as the dividing line for broadcast callsigns which begin with w to the east and k to the west mixing together in media markets along the river physical geographyedit the geographical setting of the mississippi river includes considerations of the course of the river itself its watershed its outflow its prehistoric and historic course changes and possibilities of future course changes the new madrid seismic zone along the river is also noteworthy these various basic geographical aspects of the river in turn underlie its human history and present uses of the waterway and its adjacent lands divisionsedit the mississippi river can be divided into three sections the upper mississippi the river from its headwaters to the confluence with the missouri river the middle mississippi which is downriver from the missouri to the ohio river and the lower mississippi which flows from the ohio to the gulf of mexico upper mississippiedit the upper mississippi runs from its headwaters to its confluence with the missouri river at st louis missouri it is divided into two sections from its origin at lake itasca to st louis missouri the waterway's flow is moderated by 43 dams fourteen of these dams are located above minneapolis in the headwaters region and serve multiple purposes including power generation and recreation the remaining 29 dams beginning in downtown minneapolis all contain locks and were constructed to improve commercial navigation of the upper river taken as a whole these 43 dams significantly shape the geography and influence the ecology of the upper river beginning just below saint paul minnesota and continuing throughout the upper and lower river the mississippi is further controlled by thousands of wing dikes that moderate the river's flow in order to maintain an open navigation channel and prevent the river from eroding its banks the head of navigation on the mississippi is the coon rapids dam in coon rapids minnesota before it was built in 1913 steamboats could occasionally go upstream as far as saint cloud minnesota depending on river conditions after the completion of the st anthony falls lock and dam in 1963 the river's head of navigation moved upstream to the coon rapids dam however the locks were closed in 2015 to control the spread of invasive asian carp making minneapolis once again the site of the head of navigation of the river.18 the upper mississippi river is joined by the minnesota river at fort snelling in the twin cities the st croix river near prescott wisconsin the cannon river near red wing minnesota the zumbro river at wabasha minnesota the black la crosse and root rivers in la crosse wisconsin the wisconsin river at prairie du chien wisconsin the rock river at the quad cities the iowa river near wapello iowa the skunk river south of burlington iowa and the des moines river at keokuk iowa other major tributaries of the upper mississippi include the crow river in minnesota the chippewa river in wisconsin the maquoketa river and the wapsipinicon river in iowa and the illinois river in illinois the upper mississippi is largely a multi-thread stream with many bars and islands from its confluence with the st croix river downstream to dubuque iowa the river is entrenched with high bedrock bluffs lying on either side the height of these bluffs decreases to the south of dubuque though they are still significant through savanna illinois this topography contrasts strongly with the lower mississippi which is a meandering river in a broad flat area only rarely flowing alongside a bluff as at vicksburg mississippi middle mississippiedit lower mississippiedit deliberate water diversion at the old river control structure in louisiana allows the atchafalaya river in louisiana to be a major distributary of the mississippi river with 30 of the mississippi flowing to the gulf of mexico by this route rather than continuing down the mississippi's current channel past baton rouge and new orleans on a longer route to the gulf.252627 although the red river is commonly thought to be a tributary it is actually not because its water flows separately into the gulf of mexico through the atchafalaya river watershededit in the united states the mississippi river drains the majority of the area between the crest of the rocky mountains and the crest of the appalachian mountains except for various regions drained to hudson bay by the red river of the north to the atlantic ocean by the great lakes and the saint lawrence river and to the gulf of mexico by the rio grande the alabama and tombigbee rivers the chattahoochee and appalachicola rivers and various smaller coastal waterways along the gulf outflowedit fresh river water flowing from the mississippi into the gulf of mexico does not mix into the salt water immediately the images from nasa's modis to the right show a large plume of fresh water which appears as a dark ribbon against the lighter-blue surrounding waters these images demonstrate that the plume did not mix with the surrounding sea water immediately instead it stayed intact as it flowed through the gulf of mexico into the straits of florida and entered the gulf stream the mississippi river water rounded the tip of florida and traveled up the southeast coast to the latitude of georgia before finally mixing in so thoroughly with the ocean that it could no longer be detected by modis course changesedit over geologic time the mississippi river has experienced numerous large and small changes to its main course as well as additions deletions and other changes among its numerous tributaries and the lower mississippi river has used different pathways as its main channel to the gulf of mexico across the delta region prehistoric coursesedit the current form of the mississippi river basin was largely shaped by the laurentide ice sheet of the most recent ice age the southernmost extent of this enormous glaciation extended well into the present-day united states and mississippi basin when the ice sheet began to recede hundreds of feet of rich sediment were deposited creating the flat and fertile landscape of the mississippi valley during the melt giant glacial rivers found drainage paths into the mississippi watershed creating such features as the minnesota river james river and milk river valleys when the ice sheet completely retreated many of these temporary rivers found paths to hudson bay or the arctic ocean leaving the mississippi basin with many features oversized for the existing rivers to have carved in the same time period ice sheets during the illinoian stage about 300000 to 132000 years before present blocked the mississippi near rock island illinois diverting it to its present channel farther to the west the current western border of illinois the hennepin canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the mississippi downstream from rock island to hennepin illinois south of hennepin to alton illinois the current illinois river follows the ancient channel used by the mississippi river before the illinoian stage.3435 timeline of outflow course changes36 historic course changesedit in march 1876 the mississippi suddenly changed course near the settlement of reverie tennessee leaving a small part of tipton county tennessee attached to arkansas and separated from the rest of tennessee by the new river channel since this event was an avulsion rather than the effect of incremental erosion and deposition the state line still follows the old channel.37 the town of kaskaskia illinois once stood on a peninsula at the confluence of the mississippi and kaskaskia okaw rivers founded as a french colonial community it later became the capital of the illinois territory and was the first state capital of illinois until 1819 beginning in 1844 successive flooding caused the mississippi river to slowly encroach east a major flood in 1881 caused it to overtake the lower 10 miles of the kaskaskia river forming a new mississippi channel and cutting off the town from the rest of the state later flooding destroyed most of the remaining town including the original state house today the remaining 2300 acre island and community of 14 residents is known as an enclave of illinois and is accessible only from the missouri side.38 new madrid seismic zoneedit the new madrid seismic zone along the mississippi river near new madrid missouri between memphis and st louis is related to an aulacogen failed rift that formed at the same time as the gulf of mexico this area is still quite active seismically four great earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 estimated at approximately 8 on the richter magnitude scale had tremendous local effects in the then sparsely settled area and were felt in many other places in the midwestern and eastern u.s these earthquakes created reelfoot lake in tennessee from the altered landscape near the river cultural geographyedit state boundariesedit the mississippi river runs through or along 10 states from minnesota to louisiana and was used to define portions of these states borders with wisconsin illinois kentucky tennessee and mississippi along the east side of the river and iowa missouri and arkansas along its west side substantial parts of both minnesota and louisiana are on either side of the river although the mississippi defines part of the boundary of each of these states in all of these cases the middle of the riverbed at the time the borders were established was used as the line to define the borders between adjacent states.3940 in various areas the river has since shifted but the state borders have not changed still following the former bed of the mississippi river as of their establishment leaving several small isolated areas of one state across the new river channel contiguous with the adjacent state also due to a meander in the river a small part of western kentucky is contiguous with tennessee but isolated from the rest of its state communities along the riveredit many of the communities along the mississippi river are listed below most have either historic significance or cultural lore connecting them to the river they are sequenced from the source of the river to its end bridge crossingsedit the road crossing highest on the upper mississippi is a simple steel culvert through which the river locally named nicolet creek flows north from lake nicolet under wilderness road to the west arm of lake itasca within itasca state park.41 the earliest bridge across the mississippi river was built in 1855 it spanned the river in minneapolis minnesota where the current hennepin avenue bridge is located.42 no highway or railroad tunnels cross under the mississippi river the first railroad bridge across the mississippi was built in 1856 it spanned the river between the rock island arsenal in illinois and davenport iowa steamboat captains of the day fearful of competition from the railroads considered the new bridge a hazard to navigation two weeks after the bridge opened the steamboat effie afton rammed part of the bridge setting it on fire legal proceedings ensued with abraham lincoln defending the railroad the lawsuit went to the supreme court of the united states which ruled in favor of the railroad.43 below is a general overview of selected mississippi bridges which have notable engineering or landmark significance with their cities or locations they are sequenced from the upper mississippi's source to the lower mississippi's mouth navigation and flood controledit a clear channel is needed for the barges and other vessels that make the main stem mississippi one of the great commercial waterways of the world the task of maintaining a navigation channel is the responsibility of the united states army corps of engineers which was established in 1802.44 earlier projects began as early as 1829 to remove snags close off secondary channels and excavate rocks and sandbars 19th centuryedit in 1848 the illinois and michigan canal was built to connect the mississippi river to lake michigan via the illinois river near peru illinois the canal allowed shipping between these important waterways in 1900 the canal was replaced by the chicago sanitary and ship canal the second canal in addition to shipping also allowed chicago to address specific health issues typhoid fever cholera and other waterborne diseases by sending its waste down the illinois and mississippi river systems rather than polluting its water source of lake michigan to improve navigation between st paul minnesota and prairie du chien wisconsin the corps constructed several dams on lakes in the headwaters area including lake winnibigoshish and lake pokegama the dams which were built beginning in the 1880s stored spring run-off which was released during low water to help maintain channel depth 20th centuryedit in 1913 construction was complete on lock and dam no 19 at keokuk iowa the first dam below st anthony falls built by a private power company union electric company of st louis to generate electricity originally for streetcars in st louis the keokuk dam was one of the largest hydro-electric plants in the world at the time the dam also eliminated the des moines rapids lock and dam no 1 was completed in minneapolis minnesota in 1917 lock and dam no 2 near hastings minnesota was completed in 1930 before the great mississippi flood of 1927 the corps's primary strategy was to close off as many side channels as possible to increase the flow in the main river it was thought that the river's velocity would scour off bottom sediments deepening the river and decreasing the possibility of flooding the 1927 flood proved this to be so wrong that communities threatened by the flood began to create their own levee breaks to relieve the force of the rising river u.s government scientists determined in the 1950s that the mississippi river was starting to switch to the atchafalaya river channel because of its much steeper path to the gulf of mexico eventually the atchafalaya river would capture the mississippi river and become its main channel to the gulf of mexico leaving new orleans on a side channel as a result the u.s congress authorized a project called the old river control structure which has prevented the mississippi river from leaving its current channel that drains into the gulf via new orleans.52 21st centuryedit some of the pre-1927 strategy is still in use today with the corps actively cutting the necks of horseshoe bends allowing the water to move faster and reducing flood heights.54 historyedit native americansedit the area of the mississippi river basin was first settled by hunting and gathering native american peoples and is considered one of the few independent centers of plant domestication in human history.55 evidence of early cultivation of sunflower a goosefoot a marsh elder and an indigenous squash dates to the 4th millennium bce the lifestyle gradually became more settled after around 1000 bce during what is now called the woodland period with increasing evidence of shelter construction pottery weaving and other practices a network of trade routes referred to as the hopewell interaction sphere was active along the waterways between about 200 and 500 ce spreading common cultural practices over the entire area between the gulf of mexico and the great lakes a period of more isolated communities followed and agriculture introduced from mesoamerica based on the three sisters maize beans and squash gradually came to dominate after around 800 ce there arose an advanced agricultural society today referred to as the mississippian culture with evidence of highly stratified complex chiefdoms and large population centers the most prominent of these now called cahokia was occupied between about 600 and 1400 ce56 and at its peak numbered between 8000 and 40000 inhabitants larger than london england of that time at the time of first contact with europeans cahokia and many other mississippian cities had dispersed and archaeological finds attest to increased social stress.575859 modern american indian nations inhabiting the mississippi basin include cheyenne sioux ojibwe potawatomi ho-chunk fox kickapoo tamaroa moingwena quapaw and chickasaw european explorationedit french explorers louis jolliet and jacques marquette began exploring the mississippi in the 17th century marquette traveled with a sioux indian who named it ne tongo big river in sioux language in 1673 marquette proposed calling it the river of the immaculate conception colonizationedit following britain's victory in the seven years war the mississippi became the border between the british and spanish empires the treaty of paris 1763 gave great britain rights to all land east of the mississippi and spain rights to land west of the mississippi spain also ceded florida to britain to regain cuba which the british occupied during the war britain then divided the territory into east and west florida article 8 of the treaty of paris 1783 states the navigation of the river mississippi from its source to the ocean shall forever remain free and open to the subjects of great britain and the citizens of the united states with this treaty which ended the american revolutionary war britain also ceded west florida back to spain to regain the bahamas which spain had occupied during the war in 1800 under duress from napoleon of france spain ceded an undefined portion of west florida to france when france then sold the louisiana territory to the u.s in 1803 a dispute arose again between spain and the u.s on which parts of west florida exactly had spain ceded to france which would in turn decide which parts of west florida were now u.s property versus spanish property these aspirations ended when spain was pressured into signing pinckney's treaty in 1795 france reacquired 'louisiana from spain in the secret treaty of san ildefonso in 1800 the united states then secured effective control of the river when it bought the louisiana territory from france in the louisiana purchase of 1803 the last serious european challenge to u.s control of the river came at the conclusion of war of 1812 when british forces mounted an attack on new orleans  the attack was repulsed by an american army under the command of general andrew jackson in the treaty of 1818 the u.s and great britain agreed to fix the border running from the lake of the woods to the rocky mountains along the 49th parallel north in effect the u.s ceded the northwestern extremity of the mississippi basin to the british in exchange for the southern portion of the red river basin so many settlers traveled westward through the mississippi river basin as well as settled in it that zadok cramer wrote a guide book called the navigator detailing the features and dangers and navigable waterways of the area it was so popular that he updated and expanded it through 12 editions over a period of 25 years the colonization of the area was barely slowed by the three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 estimated at approximately 8 on the richter magnitude scale that were centered near new madrid missouri steamboat eraedit mark twain's book life on the mississippi covered the steamboat commerce which took place from 1830 to 1870 on the river before more modern ships replaced the steamer the book was published first in serial form in harper's weekly in seven parts in 1875 the full version including a passage from the then unfinished adventures of huckleberry finn and works from other authors was published by james r osgood  company in 1885 steamboat transport remained a viable industry both in terms of passengers and freight until the end of the first decade of the 20th century among the several mississippi river system steamboat companies was the noted anchor line which from 1859 to 1898 operated a luxurious fleet of steamers between st louis and new orleans italian explorer giacomo beltrami wrote about his journey on the virginia which was the first steam boat to make it to fort st anthony in minnesota he referred to his voyage as a promenade that was once a journey on the mississippi the steamboat era changed the economic and political life of the mississippi as well as the nature of travel itself the mississippi was completely changed by the steamboat era as it transformed into a flourishing tourists trade.74 civil waredit control of the river was a strategic objective of both sides in the american civil war in 1862 union forces coming down the river successfully cleared confederate defenses at island number 10 and memphis tennessee while naval forces coming upriver from the gulf of mexico captured new orleans louisiana the remaining major confederate stronghold was on the heights overlooking the river at vicksburg mississippi and the union's vicksburg campaign december 1862 to july 1863 and the fall of port hudson completed control of the lower mississippi river the union victory ending the siege of vicksburg on july 4 1863 was pivotal to the union's final victory of the civil war 20th and 21st centuriesedit on october 20 1976 the automobile ferry mv george prince was struck by a ship traveling upstream as the ferry attempted to cross from destrehan louisiana to luling louisiana seventy-eight passengers and crew died only eighteen survived the accident the great flood of 1993 was another significant flood primarily affecting the mississippi above its confluence with the ohio river at cairo illinois two portions of the mississippi were designated as american heritage rivers in 1997 the lower portion around louisiana and tennessee and the upper portion around iowa illinois minnesota and missouri the nature conservancy's project called america's rivershed initiative announced a 'report card assessment of the entire basin in october 2015 and gave the grade of d+ the assessment noted the aging navigation and flood control infrastructure along with multiple environmental problems.78 in 2002 slovenian long-distance swimmer martin strel swam the entire length of the river from minnesota to louisiana over the course of 68 days in 2005 the source to sea expedition79 paddled the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers to benefit the audubon society's upper mississippi river campaign.8081 futureedit failure of the old river control structure the morganza spillway or nearby levees would likely re-route the main channel of the mississippi through louisiana's atchafalaya basin and down the atchafalaya river to reach the gulf of mexico south of morgan city in southern louisiana this route provides a more direct path to the gulf of mexico than the present mississippi river channel through baton rouge and new orleans.84 while the risk of such a diversion is present during any major flood event such a change has so far been prevented by active human intervention involving the construction maintenance and operation of various levees spillways and other control structures by the u.s army corps of engineers the old river control structure between the present mississippi river channel and the atchafalaya basin sits at the normal water elevation and is ordinarily used to divert 30 of the mississippi's flow to the atchafalaya river there is a steep drop here away from the mississippi's main channel into the atchafalaya basin if this facility were to fail during a major flood there is a strong concern the water would scour and erode the river bottom enough to capture the mississippi's main channel the structure was nearly lost during the 1973 flood but repairs and improvements were made after engineers studied the forces at play in particular the corps of engineers made many improvements and constructed additional facilities for routing water through the vicinity these additional facilities give the corps much more flexibility and potential flow capacity than they had in 1973 which further reduces the risk of a catastrophic failure in this area during other major floods such as that of 2011 recreationedit there are seven national park service sites along the mississippi river the mississippi national river and recreation area is the national park service site dedicated to protecting and interpreting the mississippi river itself the other six national park service sites along the river are listed from north to south ecologyedit the mississippi basin is home to a highly diverse aquatic fauna and has been called the mother fauna of north american fresh water.93 fishedit about 375 fish species are known from the mississippi basin far exceeding other north hemisphere river basin exclusively within temperate/subtropical regions93 except the yangtze.94 within the mississippi basin streams that have their source in the appalachian and ozark highlands contain especially many species among the fish species in the basin are numerous endemics as well as relicts such as paddlefish sturgeon gar and bowfin.93 because of its size and high species diversity the mississippi basin is often divided into subregions the upper mississippi river alone is home to about 120 fish species including walleye sauger large mouth bass small mouth bass white bass northern pike bluegill crappie channel catfish flathead catfish common shiner freshwater drum and shovelnose sturgeon.9596 other faunaedit in addition to fish several species of turtles such as snapping musk mud map cooter painted and softshell turtles american alligator aquatic amphibians such as hellbender mudpuppy three-toed amphiuma and lesser siren97 and cambarid crayfish such as the red swamp crayfish are native to the mississippi basin.98 introduced speciesedit numerous introduced species are found in the mississippi and some of these are invasive among the introductions are fish such as asian carp including the silver carp that have become infamous for outcompeting native fish and their potentially dangerous jumping behavior they have spread throughout much of the basin even approaching but not yet invading the great lakes.99 the minnesota department of natural resources has designated much of the mississippi river in the state as infested waters by the exotic species zebra mussels and eurasian watermilfoil.100 cultural referencesedit literatureedit musicedit see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools

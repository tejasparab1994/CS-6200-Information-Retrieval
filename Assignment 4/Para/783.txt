hurricane irene  contents  meteorological historyedit on august 15 2011 a tropical wave exited the west african coast and emerged into the atlantic characterized by distinct low-level cyclonic rotation and deep tropical humidity.6 it remained well-defined while moving steadily westward for several days to the south of the cape verde islands although at the time any notable convection occurred well to the southwest of its axis.7 as the wave distanced itself from the islands development of thunderstorms and showers in its proximity continued to remain scarce and it became rather broad in appearance.8 on august 19 the convective structure began to show signs of organization as the associated atmospheric pressure lowered and with a progressively favorable environment situated ahead of the wave its chances of undergoing tropical cyclogenesis markedly increased.910 the strong thunderstorm activity continued to become more pronounced around the main low-pressure feature by august 20 the national hurricane center noted that tropical cyclone formation was imminent as the wave neared the lesser antilles11 and a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the presence of a small surface circulation center just southwest of a burst of vigorous convection and unusually high sustained winds indicating sufficient organization for the cyclone to be upgraded into tropical storm irene at 23:00 utc that day.12 with the hurricane then situated just north of the mountainous coast of hispaniola the storm deepened little after reemerging over water and any additional organization during the rest of the day was gradual.2021 after briefly weakening on august 2322 however irene began to develop a distinct eye encircled by an area of deepening convection the next morning moving erratically through the southeast bahamas over very warm waters23 irene quickly expanded as its outflow aloft became very well established the cyclone intensified into a category 3 major hurricane as it recurved toward the northwest along a weakness in the subtropical ridge.24 the cyclone subsequently underwent a partial eyewall replacement cycle which resulted in some reduction in its winds although a distinct eye redeveloped for a few hours it obscured once again soon thereafter irene was unable to recover from the cycle with no further significant intensification expected thereafter.25 following its final new york landfall irene moved northeast over new england while maintaining its strength before it was declared an extratropical cyclone early on august 29 while its center was located near the new hampshire/vermont border.3 during that day the system continued to move towards the northeast before it was absorbed by a frontal system early on august 30.3 preparationsedit caribbeanedit in response to the formation of irene tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the leeward islands and puerto rico.31 also in the lesser antilles the storm's approach prompted authorities in the u.s virgin islands to close off air and seaports as well as to open public shelters.32 as irene was forecast to make landfall on hispaniola a tropical storm watch was initially issued for the south coast of the dominican republic though it was upgraded to a hurricane warning on august 21 after strengthening was forecast.33 in light of the expected intensification to hurricane status a tropical storm warning was also issued for the northern coast fire of that country while a tropical storm watch was put in effect for all of haiti the tropical storm warning for puerto rico was simultaneously upgraded to a hurricane watch.34 later that day all of the dominican republic was placed under a hurricane warning with the tropical storm watch for haiti upgraded to a warning and a tropical storm watch initiated for the southeastern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands.35 as irene's forecast track became justified the latter watch was upgraded to a warning on august 22 while a hurricane watch was declared for the central bahamas.36 united statesedit with irene's projected path fixed over much of the united states east coast over 65 million people from the

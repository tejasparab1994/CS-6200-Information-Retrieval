heat transfer coefficient the overall heat transfer by combined modes is usually expressed on terms of an overall conductance or overall heat transfer coefficient 'u' heat transfer q=uat2-t1  where it is used in calculating the heat transfer typically by convection or phase transition between a fluid and a solid the heat transfer coefficient has si units in watts per squared meter kelvin w/m2k the heat transfer coefficient is the reciprocal of thermal insulance this is used for building materials r-value and for clothing insulation there are numerous methods for calculating the heat transfer coefficient in different heat transfer modes different fluids flow regimes and under different thermohydraulic conditions often it can be estimated by dividing the thermal conductivity of the convection fluid by a length scale the heat transfer coefficient is often calculated from the nusselt number a dimensionless number there are also online calculators available specifically for heat transfer fluid applications experimental assessment of the heat transfer coefficient poses some challenges especially when small fluxes are to be measured e.g0.2wcm2displaystyle <0.2w/cm^2.12  contents  compositionedit a simple method for determining an overall heat transfer coefficient that is useful to find the heat transfer between simple elements such as walls in buildings or across heat exchangers is shown below note that this method only accounts for conduction within materials it does not take into account heat transfer through methods such as radiation the method is as follows where as the areas for each surface approach being equal the equation can be written as the transfer coefficient per unit area as shown below or it is to be noted that often the value fordxwdisplaystyle dx_w is referred to as the difference of two radii where the inner and outer radii are used to define the thickness of a pipe carrying a fluid however this figure may also be considered as a wall thickness in a flat plate transfer mechanism or other common flat surfaces such as a wall in a building when the area difference between each edge of the transmission surface approaches zero in the walls of buildings the above formula can be used to derive the formula commonly used to calculate the heat through building components architects and engineers call the resulting values either the u-value or the r-value of a construction assembly like a wall each type of value r or u are related as the inverse of each other such that r-value  1/u-value and both are more fully understood through the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient described in lower section of this document convective heat transfer correlationsedit although convective heat transfer can be derived analytically through dimensional analysis exact analysis of the boundary layer approximate integral analysis of the boundary layer and analogies between energy and momentum transfer these analytic approaches may not offer practical solutions to all problems when there are no mathematical models applicable therefore many correlations were developed by various authors to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient in various cases including natural convection forced convection for internal flow and forced convection for external flow these empirical correlations are presented for their particular geometry and flow conditions as the fluid properties are temperature dependent they are evaluated at the film temperaturetfdisplaystyle t_f which is the average of the surfacetsdisplaystyle t_s and the surrounding bulk temperaturetdisplaystyle t_infty  external flow vertical planeedit recommendations by churchill and chu provide the following correlation for natural convection adjacent to a vertical plane both for laminar and turbulent flow.34 k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid l is the characteristic length with respect to the direction of gravity ral is the rayleigh number with respect to this length and pr is the prandtl number for laminar flows the following correlation is slightly more accurate it is observed that a transition from a laminar to a turbulent boundary occurs when ral exceeds around 109 external flow vertical cylindersedit for cylinders with their axes vertical the expressions for plane surfaces can be used provided the curvature effect is not too significant this represents the limit where boundary layer thickness is small relative to cylinder diameterddisplaystyle d the correlations for vertical plane walls can be used when wheregrldisplaystyle gr_l is the grashof number external flow horizontal platesedit w h mcadams suggested the following correlations for horizontal plates.5 the induced buoyancy will be different depending upon whether the hot surface is facing up or down for a hot surface facing up or a cold surface facing down for laminar flow and for turbulent flow for a hot surface facing down or a cold surface facing up for laminar flow external flow horizontal cylinderedit for cylinders of sufficient length and negligible end effects churchill and chu has the following correlation for105rad1012displaystyle 10^-5<mathrm ra _d<10^12 external flow spheresedit forced convectionedit internal flow laminar flowedit internal flow turbulent flowedit for a fluid flowing in a straight circular pipe with a reynolds number between 10000 and 120000 in the turbulent pipe flow range when the fluid's prandtl number is between 0.7 and 120 for a location far from the pipe entrance more than 10 pipe diameters more than 50 diameters according to many authors7 or other flow disturbances and when the pipe surface is hydraulically smooth the heat transfer coefficient between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface can be expressed explicitly as where the fluid properties necessary for the application of this equation are evaluated at the bulk temperature thus avoiding iteration forced convection external flowedit in analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions for flow parallel to a plane surface wherexdisplaystyle x is the distance from the edge andldisplaystyle l is the height of the boundary layer a mean nusselt number can be calculated using the colburn analogy.6 thom correlationedit there exist simple fluid-specific correlations for heat transfer coefficient in boiling the thom correlation is for the flow of boiling water subcooled or saturated at pressures up to about 20 mpa under conditions where the nucleate boiling contribution predominates over forced convection this correlation is useful for rough estimation of expected temperature difference given the heat flux:9 where note that this empirical correlation is specific to the units given heat transfer coefficient of pipe walledit the resistance to the flow of heat by the material of pipe wall can be expressed as a heat transfer coefficient of the pipe wall however one needs to select if the heat flux is based on the pipe inner or the outer diameter selecting to base the heat flux on the pipe inner diameter and assuming that the pipe wall thickness is small in comparison with the pipe inner diameter then the heat transfer coefficient for the pipe wall can be calculated as if the wall were not curvedcitation needed where k is the effective thermal conductivity of the wall material and x is the wall thickness if the above assumption does not hold then the wall heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using the following expression where di and do are the inner and outer diameters of the pipe respectively the thermal conductivity of the tube material usually depends on temperature the mean thermal conductivity is often used combining heat transfer coefficientsedit for two or more heat transfer processes acting in parallel heat transfer coefficients simply add for two or more heat transfer processes connected in series heat transfer coefficients add inversely:10 for example consider a pipe with a fluid flowing inside the approximate rate of heat transfer between the bulk of the fluid inside the pipe and the pipe external surface is:11 where overall heat transfer coefficientedit the overall heat transfer coefficientudisplaystyle u is a measure of the overall ability of a series of conductive and convective barriers to transfer heat it is commonly applied to the calculation of heat transfer in heat exchangers but can be applied equally well to other problems for the case of a heat exchangerudisplaystyle u can be used to determine the total heat transfer between the two streams in the heat exchanger by the following relationship where the overall heat transfer coefficient takes into account the individual heat transfer coefficients of each stream and the resistance of the pipe material it can be calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of a series of thermal resistances but more complex relationships exist for example when heat transfer takes place by different routes in parallel where the heat transfer coefficient is the heat transferred per unit area per kelvin thus area is included in the equation as it represents the area over which the transfer of heat takes place the areas for each flow will be different as they represent the contact area for each fluid side the thermal resistance due to the pipe wall is calculated by the following relationship where this represents the heat transfer by conduction in the pipe the thermal conductivity is a characteristic of the particular material values of thermal conductivities for various materials are listed in the list of thermal conductivities as mentioned earlier in the article the convection heat transfer coefficient for each stream depends on the type of fluid flow properties and temperature properties some typical heat transfer coefficients include thermal resistance due to fouling depositsedit often during their use heat exchangers collect a layer of fouling on the surface which in addition to potentially contaminating a stream reduces the effectiveness of heat exchangers in a fouled heat exchanger the buildup on the walls creates an additional layer of materials that heat must flow through due to this new layer there is additional resistance within the heat exchanger and thus the overall heat transfer coefficient of the exchanger is reduced the following relationship is used to solve for the heat transfer resistance with the additional fouling resistance:13 where this equation uses the overall heat transfer coefficient of an unfouled heat exchanger and the fouling resistance to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient of a fouled heat exchanger the equation takes into account that the perimeter of the heat exchanger is different on the hot and cold sides the perimeter used for thepdisplaystyle p does not matter as long as it is the same the overall heat transfer coefficients will adjust to take into account that a different perimeter was used as the productupdisplaystyle up will remain the same the fouling resistances can be calculated for a specific heat exchanger if the average thickness and thermal conductivity of the fouling are known the product of the average thickness and thermal conductivity will result in the fouling resistance on a specific side of the heat exchanger.13 where

meteorology atmospheric physicsatmospheric dynamics category climate categoryclimate change category meteorology is a branch of the atmospheric sciences which includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting the study of meteorology dates back millennia though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 18th century the 19th century saw modest progress in the field after weather observation networks were formed across broad regions prior attempts at prediction of weather depended on historical data it wasn't until after the elucidation of the laws of physics and more particularly the development of the computer allowing for the automated solution of a great many equations that model the weather in the latter half of the 20th century that significant breakthroughs in weather forecasting were achieved meteorological phenomena are observable weather events that are explained by the science of meteorology meteorological phenomena are described and quantified by the variables of earth's atmosphere temperature air pressure water vapor mass flow and the variations and interactions of those variables and how they change over time different spatial scales are used to describe and predict weather on local regional and global levels meteorology climatology atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry are sub-disciplines of the atmospheric sciences meteorology and hydrology compose the interdisciplinary field of hydrometeorology the interactions between earth's atmosphere and its oceans are part of a coupled ocean-atmosphere system meteorology has application in many diverse fields such as the military energy production transport agriculture and construction  contents  historyedit the ability to predict rains and floods based on annual cycles was evidently used by humans at least from the time of agricultural settlement if not earlier early approaches to predicting weather were based on astrology and were practiced by priests cuneiform inscriptions on babylonian tablets included associations between thunder and rain the chaldeans differentiated the 22 and 46 halos.1 in 350 bc aristotle wrote meteorology.3 aristotle is considered the founder of meteorology.4 one of the most impressive achievements described in the meteorology is the description of what is now known as the hydrologic cycle.5 the book de mundo composed before 250 bc or between 350 and 200 bc noted6 the greek scientist theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting called the book of signs the work of theophrastus remained a dominant influence in the study of weather and in weather forecasting for nearly 2000 years.7 in 25 ad pomponius mela a geographer for the roman empire formalized the climatic zone system.8 according to toufic fahd around the 9th century al-dinawari wrote the kitab al-nabat book of plants in which he deals with the application of meteorology to agriculture during the muslim agricultural revolution he describes the meteorological character of the sky the planets and constellations the sun and moon the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain the anwa heavenly bodies of rain and atmospheric phenomena such as winds thunder lightning snow floods valleys rivers lakes.910verification needed early attempts at predicting weather were often related to prophesy and divining and sometimes based on astrological ideas admiral fitzroy tried to separate scientific approaches from prophetic ones.11 research of visual atmospheric phenomenaedit instruments and classification scalesedit atmospheric composition researchedit in 1648 blaise pascal rediscovered that atmospheric pressure decreases with height and deduced that there is a vacuum above the atmosphere.24 in 1738 daniel bernoulli published hydrodynamics initiating the kinetic theory of gases and established the basic laws for the theory of gases.25 in 1761 joseph black discovered that ice absorbs heat without changing its temperature when melting in 1772 black's student daniel rutherford discovered nitrogen which he called phlogisticated air and together they developed the phlogiston theory.26 in 1777 antoine lavoisier discovered oxygen and developed an explanation for combustion.27 in 1783 in lavoisier's essay reflexions sur le phlogistique28 he deprecates the phlogiston theory and proposes a caloric theory.2930 in 1804 sir john leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface suggesting the importance of black body radiation in 1808 john dalton defended caloric theory in a new system of chemistry and described how it combines with matter especially gases he proposed that the heat capacity of gases varies inversely with atomic weight in 1824 sadi carnot analyzed the efficiency of steam engines using caloric theory he developed the notion of a reversible process and in postulating that no such thing exists in nature laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics research into cyclones and air flowedit in 1494 christopher columbus experienced a tropical cyclone which led to the first written european account of a hurricane.31 in 1686 edmund halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions.32 in 1735 an ideal explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by george hadley.33 in 1743 when benjamin franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery.34 understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the earth affects airflow was partial at first gaspard-gustave coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts such as waterwheels.35 in 1856 william ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid-latitudes and the air within deflected by the coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds.36 late in the 19th century the motion of air masses along isobars was understood to be the result of the large-scale interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force by 1912 this deflecting force was named the coriolis effect.37 just after world war i a group of meteorologists in norway led by vilhelm bjerknes developed the norwegian cyclone model that explains the generation intensification and ultimate decay the life cycle of mid-latitude cyclones and introduced the idea of fronts that is sharply defined boundaries between air masses.38 the group included carl-gustaf rossby who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics tor bergeron who first determined how rain forms and jacob bjerknes observation networks and weather forecastingedit over the next 50 years many countries established national meteorological services the india meteorological department 1875 was established to follow tropical cyclone and monsoon.46 the finnish meteorological central office 1881 was formed from part of magnetic observatory of helsinki university.47 japan's tokyo meteorological observatory the forerunner of the japan meteorological agency began constructing surface weather maps in 1883.48 the united states weather bureau 1890 was established under the united states department of agriculture the australian bureau of meteorology 1906 was established by a meteorology act to unify existing state meteorological services.4950 numerical weather predictionedit in 1904 norwegian scientist vilhelm bjerknes first argued in his paper weather forecasting as a problem in mechanics and physics that it should be possible to forecast weather from calculations based upon natural laws.5152 it was not until later in the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction in 1922 lewis fry richardson published weather prediction by numerical process53 after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in world war i he described how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations that govern atmospheric flow could be neglected and a numerical calculation scheme that could be devised to allow predictions richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations however the sheer number of calculations required was too large to complete without electronic computers and the size of the grid and time steps used in the calculations led to unrealistic results though numerical analysis later found that this was due to numerical instability starting in the 1950s numerical forecasts with computers became feasible.54 the first weather forecasts derived this way used barotropic single-vertical-level models and could successfully predict the large-scale movement of midlatitude rossby waves that is the pattern of atmospheric lows and highs.55 in 1959 the uk meteorological office received its first computer a ferranti mercury.citation needed in the 1960s the chaotic nature of the atmosphere was first observed and mathematically described by edward lorenz founding the field of chaos theory.56 these advances have led to the current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere.57 mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the earth climate models have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models these climate models are used to investigate long-term climate shifts such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases meteorologistsedit meteorologists are scientists who study meteorology.58 the american meteorological society published and continually updates an authoritative electronic meteorology glossary.59 meteorologists work in government agencies private consulting and research services industrial enterprises utilities radio and television stations and in education in the united states meteorologists held about 9400 jobs in 2009.60 meteorologists are best known by the public for weather forecasting some radio and television weather forecasters are professional meteorologists while others are reporters weather specialist weatherman etc. with no formal meteorological training the american meteorological society and national weather association issue seals of approval to weather broadcasters who meet certain requirements equipmentedit each science has its own unique sets of laboratory equipment in the atmosphere there are many things or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured rain which can be observed or seen anywhere and anytime was one of the first atmospheric qualities measured historically also two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity neither of these can be seen but can be felt the devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge the anemometer and the hygrometer many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable even aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air sets of surface measurements are important data to meteorologists they give a snapshot of a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station a ship or a weather buoy the measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables usually temperature pressure wind measurements and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer barometer anemometer and hygrometer respectively.61 professional stations may also include air quality sensors carbon monoxide carbon dioxide methane ozone dust and smoke ceilometer cloud ceiling falling precipitation sensor flood sensor lightning sensor microphone explosions sonic booms thunder pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer ir/vis/uv photodiodes rain gauge/snow gauge scintillation counter background radiation fallout radon seismometer earthquakes and tremors transmissometer visibility and a gps clock for data logging upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting the most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the world meteorological organization spatial scalesedit the study of the atmosphere can be divided into distinct areas that depend on both time and spatial scales at one extreme of this scale is climatology in the timescales of hours to days meteorology separates into micro- meso- and synoptic scale meteorology respectively the geospatial size of each of these three scales relates directly with the appropriate timescale other subclassifications are used to describe the unique local or broad effects within those subclasses microscaleedit mesoscaleedit synoptic scaleedit global scaleedit some meteorological principlesedit boundary layer meteorologyedit dynamic meteorologyedit dynamic meteorology generally focuses on the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere the idea of air parcel is used to define the smallest element of the atmosphere while ignoring the discrete molecular and chemical nature of the atmosphere an air parcel is defined as a point in the fluid continuum of the atmosphere the fundamental laws of fluid dynamics thermodynamics and motion are used to study the atmosphere the physical quantities that characterize the state of the atmosphere are temperature density pressure etc these variables have unique values in the continuum.69 applicationsedit weather forecastingedit weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere at a future time and given location humans have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since at least the 19th century.7071 weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.72 once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure current weather conditions and sky condition7374 forecast models are now used to determine future conditions human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon which involves pattern recognition skills teleconnections knowledge of model performance and knowledge of model biases the chaotic nature of the atmosphere the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere error involved in measuring the initial conditions and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made the range of the forecast increases the use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.757677 there are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property.78 forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture79808182 and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.838485 on an everyday basis people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain snow and wind chill forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead and survive them aviation meteorologyedit aviation meteorology deals with the impact of weather on air traffic management it is important for air crews to understand the implications of weather on their flight plan as well as their aircraft as noted by the aeronautical information manual:86 agricultural meteorologyedit meteorologists soil scientists agricultural hydrologists and agronomists are persons concerned with studying the effects of weather and climate on plant distribution crop yield water-use efficiency phenology of plant and animal development and the energy balance of managed and natural ecosystems conversely they are interested in the role of vegetation on climate and weather.88 hydrometeorologyedit hydrometeorology is the branch of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle the water budget and the rainfall statistics of storms.89 a hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating quantitative precipitation heavy rain heavy snow and highlights areas with the potential for flash flooding typically the range of knowledge that is required overlaps with climatology mesoscale and synoptic meteorology and other geosciences.90 the multidisciplinary nature of the branch can result in technical challenges since tools and solutions from each of the individual disciplines involved may behave slightly differently be optimized for different hard and software platforms and use different data formats there are some initiatives  such as the drihm project91  that are trying to address this issue.92 nuclear meteorologyedit nuclear meteorology investigates the distribution of radioactive aerosols and gases in the atmosphere.93 maritime meteorologyedit maritime meteorology deals with air and wave forecasts for ships operating at sea organizations such as the ocean prediction center honolulu national weather service forecast office united kingdom met office and jma prepare high seas forecasts for the world's oceans military meteorologyedit military meteorology is the research and application of meteorology for military purposes in the united states the united states navy's commander naval meteorology and oceanography command oversees meteorological efforts for the navy and marine corps while the united states air force's air force weather agency is responsible for the air force and army environmental meteorologyedit environmental meteorology mainly analyzes industrial pollution dispersion physically and chemically based on meteorological parameters such as

sea surface temperature coastal ssts can cause offshore winds to generate upwelling which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses but shallower waters over a continental shelf are often warmer onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant such as the northwest coast of south america its values are important within numerical weather prediction as the sst influences the atmosphere above such as in the formation of sea breezes and sea fog it is also used to calibrate measurements from weather satellites  contents  measurementedit there are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured away from the immediate sea surface general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement this is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean's surface and strong vertical temperature gradients a diurnal thermocline.2 sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean known as the near-surface layer.3 thermometersedit weather satellitesedit weather satellites have been available to determine sea surface temperature information since 1967 with the first global composites created during 1970.10 since 198211 satellites have been increasingly utilized to measure sst and have allowed its spatial and temporal variation to be viewed more fully satellite measurements of sst are in reasonable agreement with in situ temperature measurements.12 the satellite measurement is made by sensing the ocean radiation in two or more wavelengths within the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum or other parts of the spectrum which can then be empirically related to sst.13 these wavelengths are chosen because they are the satellite-measured sst provides both a synoptic view of the ocean and a high frequency of repeat views16 allowing the examination of basin-wide upper ocean dynamics not possible with ships or buoys nasa's national aeronautic and space administration moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sst satellites have been providing global sst data since 2000 available with a one-day lag noaa's goes geostationary orbiting earth satellites satellites are geo-stationary above the western hemisphere which enables to them to deliver sst data on an hourly basis with only a few hours of lag time there are several difficulties with satellite-based absolute sst measurements first in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates from the top skin of the ocean approximately the top 0.01 mm or less which may not represent the bulk temperature of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime reflected radiation as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation all these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods complicating ground truth efforts.17 secondly the satellite cannot look through clouds creating a cool bias in satellite-derived ssts within cloudy areas.2 however passive microwave techniques can accurately measure sst and penetrate cloud cover.13 within atmospheric sounder channels on weather satellites which peak just above the ocean's surface knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration.2 local variationedit atlantic multidecadal oscillationedit the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo is important for how external forcings are linked with north atlantic ssts.27 regional variationedit importance to the earth's atmosphereedit tropical cyclonesedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

japan made major military moves into southeast asia and the east indies islands of the south pacific ocean against the british and dutch colonies opening a new wider pacific phase in the second world war the northern mariana islands had become a league of nations mandate assigned to japan in 1919 pursuant to the treaty of versailles of 1919 it was the chamorros indigenous island people from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military after the war this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas guam's chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them whereas having been administered by japan for over 30 years the northern mariana chamorros were loyal to the japanese government the japanese occupation of guam lasted for approximately thirty-one months during this period the indigenous people of guam were subjected to forced labor family separation incarceration execution concentration camps and forced prostitution approximately one thousand people died during the occupation according to later congressional committee testimony in 2004 some historians estimate that war violence killed 10 of guam's then 20000

of the island's fresh water steep coastal cliffs dominate the north while the southern end of the island is mountainous with lower hills in between.1 climateedit since super typhoon pamela in 1976 wooden structures have been largely replaced by concrete structures.2829 during the 1980s wooden utility poles began to be replaced by typhoon-resistant concrete and steel poles after the local government enforced stricter construction codes many home and business owners built their structures out of reinforced concrete with installed typhoon shutters demographicsedit ethnic groupsedit based

center 2010:32 cultureedit post-european-contact chamorro guamanian culture is a combination of american spanish filipino other micronesian islander and mexican traditions few indigenous pre-hispanic customs remained following spanish contact hispanic influences are manifested in the local language music dance sea navigation cuisine fishing games such as batu chonka estuleks and bayogu songs and fashion due to foreign cultural influence from spain most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-hispanic culture in the last few decades some scholars have traveled throughout the pacific islands conducting research to study what the original chamorro cultural practices such as dance language and canoe building may have been like the cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation the increasing numbers of chamorros especially chamorro youth relocating to the u.s mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro identity.citation needed while only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms the resurgence of interest among the chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the chamorro people sportsedit pacific gamesedit guam hosted the pacific games in 1975 and 1999 at the 2007 games guam finished 7th of 22 countries and 14th at the 2011 games

fights out of guam economyedit guam's economy depends primarily on tourism department of defense installations and locally owned businesses despite paying no income or excise tax it receives large transfer payments from the general revenues of the u.s federal treasury under the provisions of a special law by congress it is guam's treasury rather than the u.s treasury that receives the federal income taxes paid by local taxpayers including military and civilian federal employees assigned to guam the compacts of free association between the united states the federated states of micronesia the republic of the marshall islands and the republic of palau accorded the former entities of the trust territory of the pacific islands a political status of free association with the united states the compacts give citizens of these island nations generally no restrictions to reside in the united states also its territories and many were attracted to guam due to its proximity environmental and cultural familiarity over the years it was claimed by some in guam that the territory has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved and the federal government should compensate the states and territories affected by this type of migration.citation needed over the years congress had appropriated compact impact aids to guam the northern mariana islands and hawaii and eventually this appropriation was written into each renewed compact some however continue to claim the compensation is not enough or that the distribution of actual compensation received is significantly disproportionate.citation needed as of 2008update guam's largest single private sector employer with about 1400 jobs was continental micronesia a subsidiary of continental airlines;39 it is now a part of united airlines a subsidiary of chicago-based united continental holdings inc.40 as of 2008update the continental

states house of representatives currently democrat madeleine z bordallo the delegate does not have a vote on the final passage of legislation but is accorded a vote in committee and the privilege to speak to the house u.s citizens in guam vote in a straw poll for their choice in the u.s presidential general election but since guam has no votes in the electoral college the poll has no real effect however in sending delegates to the republican and democratic national conventions guam does have influence in the national presidential race these delegates are elected by local party conventions.5 political statusedit in the 1980s and early 1990s there was a significant movement in favor of this u.s territory becoming a commonwealth which would give it a level of self-government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands however the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of guam proposed because its clauses were incompatible with the territorial clause art iv sec 3 cl 2 of the u.s constitution other movements advocate u.s statehood for guam union with the state of hawaii or union with the northern mariana islands as a single territory or independence.42 in a 1982 plebiscite voters indicated interest in seeking commonwealth status.citation needed the island has been considering another non-binding plebiscite on decolonization since 1998 governor eddie baza calvo intended to include one during the island's november 2016 elections but it was delayed again.43 a commission on decolonization was established in 1997 to educate the people of guam about the various political status options in its relationship with the u.s. statehood free association and independence the group was dormant for some years in 2013 the commission began seeking funding to start a public education campaign there were few subsequent developments until late 2016 in early december 2016 the commission scheduled a series of education sessions in various villages about the current status of guam's relationship with the u.s and the self-determination options that might be considered.43 the commission's current executive director is edward alvarez and there are ten members the group is also expected to release position papers on independence and statehood but the contents have not yet been completed.44 the united nations is in favor of greater self-determination for guam and other such territories the un's special committee on decolonization has agreed to endorse the governor's education plan the commission's may 2016 report states with academics from the university of guam the commission was working to create and approve educational materials the office of the governor was collaborating closely with the commission in developing educational materials for the public.45 the united states department of the interior had approved a $300000 grant for decolonization education edward alvarez told the united nations pacific regional seminar in may 2016 we are hopeful that this might indicate a shift in united states policy to its non-self-governing territories such as guam where they will be more willing to engage in discussions about our future and offer true support to help push us towards true self-governances and self-determination.46 villagesedit guam is divided into nineteen municipalities called villages military basesedit in addition to on-shore military installations guam along with the rest of the mariana islands is being prepared to be the westernmost military training range for the u.s guam is currently viewed as a key military hub that will further allow u.s military power to be projected via sea and sky the u.s military has proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on guam and moving 8600 marines and 9000 of their dependents to guam from okinawa japan including the required construction workers this buildup would increase guam's population by 45% in a february 2010 letter the united states environmental protection agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs.48 by 2012 these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4800 marines stationed on the island two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their dependents.49 with the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of u.s marines from okinawa japan to guam slated to begin in 2010 and last for the next several years thereafter the amount of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40 of the entire landmass of guam in january 2011 the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fy2011 indicated that recent significant events will delay the deadline for realigning u.s marine corps service members and their families from okinawa to guam the transfer may be as late as 2020 in addition the defense authorization act cut approximately $320 million from the 2011 budget request villagers and the military community are interconnected in many ways many villagers serve in the military or are retired many active duty personnel and defense department civilians also live in the villages outside of the military installation areas the military and village communities have adoption programs where guam's population and military personnel stationed on guam perform community service projects transportation and communicationsedit most of the island has state-of-the-art mobile phone services and high-speed internet widely available through either cable or dsl guam was added to the north american numbering plan nanp in 1997 country code 671 became nanp area code 67150 removing the barrier of high-cost international long-distance calls to the u.s mainland guam is also a major hub for submarine cables between the western u.s. hawaii australia and asia guam currently serves twelve submarine cables with most continuing to china the speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year light first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland but larger first-class or priority items can take a week or two fourth-class mail such as magazines are transported by sea after reaching hawaii most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to guam instead of usa to avoid being routed the long way through the u.s mainland and possibly charged a higher rate especially from asia the commercial port of guam is the island's lifeline because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii-based shipping line matson inc whose container ships connect guam with honolulu hawaii los angeles california oakland california and seattle washington the port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500000 customers throughout the micronesian region the port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the island's u.s department of defense installations andersen air force base and commander naval forces marianas and eventually the third marine expeditionary force guam is served by the antonio b won pat international airport which is a hub for united airlines the island is outside the united states customs zone so guam is responsible for establishing and operating its own customs and quarantine agency and jurisdiction therefore the u.s customs and border protection only carries immigration but not customs functions since guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction passengers arriving directly from the united states skip immigration and proceed directly to guam customs and quarantine however due to the guam and cnmi visa waiver program for certain countries an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on guam for flights to the states for travel from the northern mariana islands to guam a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to guam on flights from guam to the northern mariana islands no immigration check is performed traveling between guam and the states through a foreign point however does require a passport most residents travel within guam using personally owned vehicles the local government currently outsources the only public bus system guam regional transit authority and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locations ecologyedit brown tree snakeedit believed to be a stowaway on a u.s military transport near the end of world war ii the brown tree snake boiga irregularis was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea and the solomon islands it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's cargo flow the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands.5152 before the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the guam rail or ko'ko bird in chamorro and the guam flycatcher both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction.53 according to many elders ko'ko birds were common in guam before world war ii.54 other bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow the mariana swiftlet and the micronesian starling though populations are present on other islands including rota.53 guam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of birdsong.5556 coconut rhinoceros beetleedit other invasive animal speciesedit from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries the spanish introduced pigs dogs chickens the philippine deer rusa mariannus black francolins and carabao a subspecies of water buffalo which have cultural significance herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems after birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective the u.s military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residents.57 guam has no native amphibian species but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam litoria fallax native to the eastern coast of australia has been present in guam since 1968 and rhinella marina the cane toad was brought to the island in 1937 the other 6 amphibian species namely hylarana guentheri native to mainland asia microhyla pulchra native to mainland asia polypedates braueri endemic to taiwan eleutherodactylus planirostris native to the caribbean fejervarya cancrivora the guam variety being most closely related to f cancrivora found in taiwan and fejervarya limnocharis native to southeast asia have been in guam since 2003.59 many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo especially from taiwan mainland china and southeast asia introduced feral pigs and deer over-hunting and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of guam's native plants and animals threats to indigenous plantsedit invading animal species are not the only threat to guam's native flora tinangaja a virus affecting coconut palms was first observed on the island in 1917 when copra production was still a major part of guam's economy though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of guam.60 during the past century the dense forests of northern guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan-tangan brush leucaena leucocephala much of guam's foliage was lost during world war ii in 1947 the u.s military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905.61 in southern guam non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape although the colorful and impressive flame tree delonix regia is found throughout the marianas the tree on guam has been largely decimated wildfiresedit wildfires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the island's humid climate most fires are caused by humans with 80 resulting from arson.62 poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas grasslands and barrens have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river leading to water quality problems for southern guam eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers planting trees have had little success in preserving natural habitats.63 aquatic preservesedit efforts have been made to protect guam's coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers this is important. in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists.64 before adopting u.s environmental protection agency standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests.6566 tumon bay has since been made into a preserve a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit bats.67 harvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii the green sea turtle chelonia mydas was harvested legally on guam before august 1978 when it was listed as threatened under the endangered species act the hawksbill sea turtle eretmochelys imbricata has been on the endangered list since 1970 in an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on guam routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and nest sites are recorded and monitored for hatchlings whitespotted boxfish ostracion meleagris educationedit colleges and universitiesedit the university of guam uog and guam community college both fully accredited by the western association of schools and colleges offer courses in higher education.68 uog is a member of the exclusive group of only 76 land-grant institutions in the entire united states pacific islands university is a small christian liberal arts institution nationally accredited by the transnational association of christian colleges and schools they offer courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels primary and secondary schoolsedit before september 1997 the u.s department of defense partnered with guam board of education.73 in september 1997 the dodea opened its own schools for children of military personnel.74 dodea schools which also serve children of some federal civilian employees had an attendance of 2500 in 2000 dodea guam operates three elementary/middle schools and one high school.75 public librariesedit health careedit the government of guam maintains the island's main health care facility guam memorial hospital in tamuning.77 u.s board certified doctors and dentists practice in all specialties in addition the u.s naval hospital in agana heights serves active-duty members and dependents of the military community.78 there is one subscriber-based air ambulance located on the island carejet which provides emergency patient transportation across guam and surrounding islands.79 a private hospital the guam regional medical city opened its doors in early 2016.80 film-makingedit over the years a number of films have been shot on guam including shiro's head directed by the muna brothers and the

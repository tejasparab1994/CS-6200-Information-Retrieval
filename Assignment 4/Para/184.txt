hurricane katrina hurricane katrina was an extremely destructive and deadly tropical cyclone that was one of the costliest natural disasters and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the united states.2 it also was the costliest us disaster until 2017 when hurricane harvey hit the united states gulf coast it was the eleventh named storm the fifth hurricane and the third major hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season over fifty breaches in new orleans's hurricane surge protection were the cause of the majority of the death and destruction during katrina on august 29 2005 eventually 80 of the city and large tracts of neighboring parishes became flooded and the floodwaters lingered for weeks.5 according to a modeling exercise conducted by the u.s army corps of engineers usace two-thirds of the deaths in greater new orleans were due to levee and floodwall failure.6 all of the major studies concluded that the usace the designers and builders of the levee system as mandated by the flood control act of 1965 was responsible this is mainly due to a decision to use shorter steel sheet pilings in an effort to save money.7 in january 2008 judge stanwood duval u.s district court ruled that despite the corps role in the flooding the agency8 could not be held financially liable because of sovereign immunity in the flood control act of 1928 exactly ten years after katrina j david rogers lead author of a new report in the official journal of the world water council concluded that the flooding during katrina could have been prevented had the corps retained an external review board to double-check its flood-wall designs.910 there was also an investigation of the responses from federal state and local governments resulting in the resignation of federal emergency management agency fema director michael d brown and of new orleans police department nopd superintendent eddie compass many other government officials were criticized for their responses especially new orleans mayor ray nagin louisiana governor kathleen blanco and president george w bush several agencies including the united states coast guard uscg national hurricane center nhc and national weather service nws were commended for their actions the nhc provided accurate hurricane forecasts with sufficient lead time.11  contents  meteorological history hurricane katrina formed as tropical depression twelve over the southeastern bahamas on august 23 2005 as the result of an interaction between a tropical wave and the remnants of tropical depression ten the storm strengthened into tropical storm katrina on the morning of august 24 the tropical storm moved towards florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making landfall between hallandale beach and aventura on the morning of august 25 the storm weakened over land but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the gulf of mexico and it continued strengthening over open waters on august 27 the storm reached category 3 intensity on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale becoming the third major hurricane of the season an eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size.1 the storm rapidly intensified after entering the gulf growing from a category 3 hurricane to a category 5 hurricane in just nine hours this rapid growth was due to the storm's movement over the unusually warm waters of the loop current.12 preparations federal government the united states coast guard began pre-positioning resources in a ring around the expected impact zone and activated more than 400 reservists on august 27 it moved its personnel out of the new orleans region prior to the mandatory evacuation.14 aircrews from the aviation training center in mobile staged rescue aircraft from texas to florida.15 all aircraft were returning towards the gulf of mexico by the afternoon of august 29 air crews many of whom lost their homes during the hurricane began a round-the-clock rescue effort in new orleans and along the mississippi and alabama coastlines.16 voluntary and mandatory evacuations were issued for large areas of southeast louisiana as well as coastal mississippi and alabama about 1.2 million residents of the gulf coast were covered under a voluntary or mandatory evacuation order.1 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa florida and gulf coast by sunday august 28 most infrastructure along the gulf coast had been shut down including all freight and amtrak rail traffic into the evacuation areas as well as the waterford nuclear generating station.33 louisiana in louisiana the state's hurricane evacuation plan calls for local governments in areas along and near the coast to evacuate in three phases starting with the immediate coast 50 hours before the start of tropical storm force winds persons in areas designated phase ii begin evacuating 40 hours before the onset of tropical storm winds and those in phase iii areas including new orleans evacuate 30 hours before the start of such winds.34 many private caregiving facilities that relied on bus companies and ambulance services for evacuation were unable to evacuate their charges because they waited too long.35 louisiana's emergency operations plan supplement 1c part ii section ii paragraph d calls for use of school and other public buses in evacuations.36 although buses that later flooded were available to transport those dependent upon public transportation not enough bus drivers were available to drive them as governor blanco did not sign an emergency waiver to allow any licensed driver to transport evacuees on school buses.37 at a news conference at 10 am on august 28 shortly after katrina was upgraded to a category 5 storm new orleans mayor ray nagin ordered the first-ever mandatory evacuation of the city calling katrina a storm that most of us have long feared.40 the city government also established several refuges of last resort for citizens who could not leave the city including the massive louisiana superdome which sheltered approximately 26000 people and provided them with food and water for several days as the storm came ashore.4142 some estimates claimed that 80 of the 1.3 million residents of the greater new orleans metropolitan area evacuated leaving behind substantially fewer people than remained in the city during the hurricane ivan evacuation.43 impact on august 29 katrina's storm surge caused 53 breaches to various flood protection structures in and around the greater new orleans area submerging 80 of the city a june 2007 report by the american society of civil engineers indicated that two-thirds of the flooding was caused by the multiple failures of the city's floodwalls.47 the storm surge also devastated the coasts of mississippi and alabama making katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the united states and the deadliest hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane the total damage from katrina is estimated at $108 billion 2005 u.s dollars.148 even in 2010 debris remained in some coastal communities.51 florida bahamas and cuba before striking south florida katrina traversed the bahamas as a tropical storm however minimal impact was reported with only fresh breezes on various islands.54 louisiana hard-hit st bernard parish was flooded because of breaching of the levees that contained a navigation channel called the mississippi river gulf outlet mr-go and the breach of the 40 arpent canal levee that was designed and built by the orleans levee board the search for the missing was undertaken by the st bernard fire department because of the assets of the united states coast guard being diverted to new orleans in the months after the storm many of the missing were tracked down by searching flooded homes tracking credit card records and visiting homes of family and relatives.58 according to the u.s dept of housing and urban development in st bernard parish 81 20229 of the housing units were damaged in st tammany parish 70 48792 were damaged and in placquemines parish 80 7212 were damaged.59 new orleans as the eye of hurricane katrina swept to the northeast it subjected the city to hurricane conditions for hours although power failures prevented accurate measurement of wind speeds in new orleans there were a few measurements of hurricane-force winds from this the nhc concluded that it is likely that much of the city experienced sustained winds of category 1 or category 2 strength katrina's storm surge led to 53 levee breaches in the federally built levee system protecting metro new orleans and the failure of the 40 arpent canal levee nearly every levee in metro new orleans was breached as hurricane katrina passed just east of the city limits failures occurred in new orleans and surrounding communities especially st bernard parish the mississippi river gulf outlet mr-go breached its levees in approximately 20 places flooding much of east new orleans most of st bernard parish and the east bank of plaquemines parish the major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th street canal levee the london avenue canal and the wide navigable industrial canal which left approximately 80 of the city flooded.61 most of the major roads traveling into and out of the city were damaged the only routes out of the city were the westbound crescent city connection and the huey p long bridge as large portions of the i-10 twin span bridge traveling eastbound towards slidell louisiana had collapsed both the lake pontchartrain causeway and the crescent city connection only carried emergency traffic.62 on august 29 at 7:40 am cdt it was reported that most of the windows on the north side of the hyatt regency new orleans had been blown out and many other high rise buildings had extensive window damage.63 the hyatt was the most severely damaged hotel in the city with beds reported to be flying out of the windows insulation tubes were exposed as the hotel's glass exterior was completely sheared off.64 the superdome which was sheltering many people who had not evacuated sustained significant damage.65 two sections of the superdome's roof were compromised and the dome's waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off louis armstrong new orleans international airport was closed before the storm but did not flood on august 30 it was reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations limited commercial passenger service resumed at the airport on september 13 and regular carrier operations resumed in early october.66 levee breaches in new orleans also caused a significant number of deaths with over 700 bodies recovered in new orleans by october 23 2005.67 some survivors and evacuees reported seeing dead bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections especially in the east of the city the advanced state of decomposition of many corpses some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.68 the first deaths reported from the city were reported shortly before midnight on august 28 as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to baton rouge most likely from dehydration an estimated 215 bodies were found in nursing homes and hospitals in new orleans69 the largest number being at the memorial medical center where 45 corpses were recovered.70 some 200 patients at the charity hospital weren't evacuated until friday september 2 having been without power or fresh water for five days.71 while there were also early reports of fatalities amid mayhem at the superdome only six deaths were confirmed there with four of these originating from natural causes one from a drug overdose and one a suicide at the convention center four bodies were recovered one of the four is believed to be the result of a homicide.72 there is evidence that many prisoners were abandoned in their cells during the storm while the guards sought shelter hundreds of prisoners were later registered as unaccounted for.73747576 mississippi the gulf coast of mississippi suffered massive damage from the impact of hurricane katrina on august 29 leaving 238 people dead 67 missing and billions of dollars in damage bridges barges boats piers houses and cars were washed inland.77 katrina traveled up the entire state and afterwards all 82 counties in mississippi were declared disaster areas for federal assistance 47 for full assistance.77 mississippi emergency management agency officials also recorded deaths in forrest hinds warren and leake counties over 900000 people throughout the state experienced power outages.56 southeast united states eastern arkansas received light rain from the passage of katrina.81 gusty winds downed some trees and power lines though damage was minimal katrina also caused a number of power outages in many areas with over 100000 customers affected in tennessee primarily in the memphis and nashville areas other u.s states and canada aftermath economic effects katrina displaced over one million people from the central gulf coast to elsewhere across the united states becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the united states.95 houston texas had an increase of 35000 people mobile alabama gained over 24000 baton rouge louisiana over 15000 and hammond louisiana received over 10000 nearly doubling its size chicago illinois received over 6000 people the most of any non-southern city.96 by late january 2006 about 200000 people were once again living in new orleans less than half of the pre-storm population.97 by july 1 2006 when new population estimates were calculated by the u.s census bureau the state of louisiana showed a population decline of 219563 or 4.87%.98 additionally some insurance companies have stopped insuring homeowners in the area because of the high costs from hurricanes katrina and rita or have raised homeowners insurance premiums to cover their risk.99 environmental effects the damage from katrina forced the closure of 16 national wildlife refuges breton national wildlife refuge lost half its area in the storm.105 as a result the hurricane affected the habitats of sea turtles mississippi sandhill cranes red-cockaded woodpeckers and alabama beach mice.105 katrina also produced massive tree loss along the gulf coast particularly in louisiana'a pearl river basin and among bottomland hardwood forests before the storm the standard mortality rate for the area's trees was 1.9% but this interval increased to 20.5 by the end of 2006.106 delayed mortality as an effect of the storm continued with rates up to 5 until 2011.107 this significant loss in biomass caused greater decay and an increase in carbon emissions for example by 2006 the decreased biomass in bottomland hardwood forests contributed an amount of carbon which equated to roughly 140 of the net annual u.s carbon sink in forest trees.108 finally as part of the cleanup effort the flood waters that covered new orleans were pumped into lake pontchartrain a process that took 43 days to complete.48 these residual waters contained a mix of raw sewage bacteria heavy metals pesticides toxic chemicals and oil which sparked fears in the scientific community of massive numbers of fish dying.92 reestablishing governance shortly after the hurricane moved away on august 30 2005 some residents of new orleans who remained in the city began looting stores many were in search of food and water that were not available to them through any other means as well as non-essential items.109 additionally there were reports of carjacking murders thefts and rapes in new orleans some sources later determined that many of the reports were inaccurate greatly exaggerated or completely false leading news agencies to print retractions.110 thousands of national guard and federal troops were mobilized and sent to louisiana with 7841 in the area on august 29 to a maximum of 46838 on september 10 a number of local law enforcement agents from across the country were temporarily deputized by the state they have m16s and are locked and loaded these troops know how to shoot and kill and i expect they will louisiana governor kathleen blanco said.111 congressman bill jefferson told abc news there was shooting going on there was sniping going on over the first week of september law and order were gradually restored to the city.112 several shootings occurred between police and new orleans residents some involving police misconduct including an incident that killed two unarmed civilians and seriously injured other others at danziger bridge.113 five former police officers pleaded guilty to charges connected to the danziger bridge shootings in the aftermath of the hurricane six other former or current officers appeared in court in june 2011.114 overall a number of arrests were made throughout the affected area including some near the new orleans convention center a temporary jail was constructed of chain link cages in the new orleans union passenger terminal the city's main train station.115 in west virginia where roughly 350 refugees were located local officials took fingerprints to run criminal background checks on the refugees the background checks found that 45 of the refugees had a criminal record of some nature and that 22 had a violent criminal record.116 media speculation fueled a popular perception that the displaced new orleans residents brought a wave of crime into the communities where they relocated however detailed studies of crime statistics in these communities did not reveal a significant increase in violent crime.117118119 government response within the united states and as delineated in the national response plan disaster response and planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility when local government exhausts its resources it then requests specific additional resources from the county level the request process proceeds similarly from the county to the state to the federal government as additional resource needs are identified many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communication systems at various levels.120 some disaster recovery response to katrina began before the storm with federal emergency management agency fema preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a mortuary team with refrigerated trucks a network of volunteers began rendering assistance to local residents and residents emerging from new orleans and surrounding parishes as soon as the storm made landfall even though many were directed to not enter the area and continued for more than six months after the storm120 of the 60000 people stranded in new orleans the coast guard rescued more than 33500.121 congress recognized the coast guard's response with an official entry in the congressional record122 and the armed service was awarded the presidential unit citation.123 michael chertoff secretary of the department of homeland security decided to take over the federal state and local operations officially on august 30 2005 citing the national response plan.126 this was refused by governor blanco who indicated that her national guard could manage early in september congress authorized a total of $62.3 billion in aid for victims.127 additionally president bush enlisted the help of former presidents bill clinton and george h w bush to raise additional voluntary contributions much as they did after the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami.128 american flags were also ordered to be half-staff from september 2 2005 to september 20 2005 in honor of the victims.129 law enforcement and public safety agencies from across the united states provided a mutual aid response to louisiana and new orleans in the weeks following the disaster many agencies responded with manpower and equipment from as far away as california michigan nevada new york and texas this response was welcomed by local louisiana authorities as their staff were either becoming fatigued stretched too thin or even quitting from the job.133 criticism of government response the criticisms of the government's response to hurricane katrina primarily consisted of criticism of mismanagement and lack of leadership in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath more specifically the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of new orleans and the subsequent state of chaos in the city.72 the neologism katrinagate was coined to refer to this controversy and was a runner-up for 2005 word of the year.135 within days of katrina's august 29 landfall public debate arose about the local state and federal governments role in the preparations for and response to the hurricane criticism was initially prompted by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders and of residents who remained stranded by flood waters without water food or shelter deaths from thirst exhaustion and violence days after the storm had passed fueled the criticism as did the dilemma of the evacuees at facilities such as the louisiana superdome and the new orleans civic center some alleged that race class and other factors could have contributed to delays in government response for example during a concert for hurricane relief a benefit concert for victims of the hurricane rapper kanye west veered off script and harshly criticized the government's response to the crisis stating that george bush doesn't care about black people.136 in accordance with federal law president george w bush directed the secretary of the department of homeland security michael chertoff to coordinate the federal response chertoff designated michael d brown head of the federal emergency management agency as the principal federal official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the gulf coast region however the president and secretary chertoff initially came under harsh criticism for what some perceived as a lack of planning and coordination brown claimed that governor blanco resisted their efforts and was unhelpful governor blanco and her staff disputed this.137 eight days later brown was recalled to washington and coast guard vice admiral thad w allen replaced him as chief of hurricane relief operations.138 three days after the recall michael d brown resigned as director of fema in spite of having received recent praise from president bush.139 politicians activists pundits and journalists also directed criticism at the local and state governments headed by mayor nagin of new orleans and louisiana governor blanco nagin and blanco were criticized for failing to implement new orleans evacuation plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food water security or sanitary conditions perhaps the most important criticism of nagin was that he delayed his emergency evacuation order until 19 hours before landfall which led to hundreds of deaths of people who could not find any way out of the city.11 the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina raised other more general public policy issues about emergency management environmental policy poverty and unemployment the discussion of both the immediate response and of the broader public policy issues may have affected elections and legislation enacted at various levels of government the storm's devastation also prompted a congressional investigation which found that fema and the red cross did not have a logistics capacity sophisticated enough to fully support the massive number of gulf coast victims. additionally it placed responsibility for the disaster on all three levels of government.11 an abc news poll conducted on september 2 2005 showed more blame was being directed at state and local governments 75% than at the federal government 67% with 44 blaming bush's leadership directly.140 a later cnn/usatoday/gallup poll showed that respondents disagreed widely on who was to blame for the problems in the city following the hurricane  13 said bush 18 said federal agencies 25 blamed state or local officials and 38 said no one was to blame.141 a 2013 pool of louisiana republicans found more 29% blamed barack obama for the poor federal response to the hurricane than george w bush 28% despite the fact that bush was actually president during the storm and obama merely a junior senator.142143 international response over seventy countries pledged monetary donations or other assistance cuba and venezuela both considered as hostile to us government interest were the first countries to offer assistance pledging over $1 million several mobile hospitals water treatment plants canned food bottled water heating oil 1100 doctors and 26.4 metric tons of medicine though this aid was rejected by the u.s government.144145146147 kuwait made the largest single pledge $500 million other large donations were made by qatar and united arab emirates each $100 million south korea $30 million australia $10 million india china both $5 million new zealand $2 million148 pakistan $1.5 million149 norway $1.8 million150 and bangladesh $1 million.151 india sent tarps blankets and hygiene kits an indian air force il-76 aircraft delivered 25 tonnes of relief supplies for the hurricane katrina victims at the little rock air force base arkansas on september 13 2005 israel sent an idf delegation to new orleans to transport aid equipment including 80 tons of food disposable diapers beds blankets generators and additional equipment which were donated from different governmental institutions civilian institutions and the idf.152 the bush administration announced in mid-september that it did not need israeli divers and physicians to come to the united states for search and rescue missions but a small team landed in new orleans on september 10 to give assistance to operations already under way the team administered first aid to survivors rescued abandoned pets and discovered hurricane victims.153 countries like sri lanka which was still recovering from the indian ocean tsunami also offered to help countries including canada mexico singapore and germany sent supplies relief personnel like technisches hilfswerk troops ships and water pumps to aid in the disaster recovery belgium sent in a team of relief personnel britain's donation of 350000 emergency meals did not reach victims because of laws regarding mad cow disease.154 russia's initial offer of two jets was declined by the u.s state department but accepted later the french offer was also declined and requested later.155 non-governmental organization response the american red cross america's second harvest now known as feeding america southern baptist convention salvation army oxfam common ground collective burners without borders156 emergency communities habitat for humanity catholic charities service international a river of hope the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints157158159 and many other charitable organizations provided help to the victims of the storm they were not allowed into new orleans proper by the national guard for several days after the storm because of safety concerns these organizations raised us$4.25 billion in donations by the public with the red cross receiving over half of the donations.160 some smaller organizations and individuals ignored the access restrictions and provided early relief for example two privately chartered planes from fastercures evacuated 200 patents from charity hospital in new orleans.161 volunteers from amateur radio's emergency service wing the amateur radio emergency service provided communications in areas where the communications infrastructure had been damaged or totally destroyed relaying everything from 911 traffic to messages home.162 in hancock county mississippi ham radio operators provided the only communications into or out of the area and even served as 911 dispatchers.163 many corporations also contributed to relief efforts on september 13 2005 it was reported that corporate donations to the relief effort were $409 million and were expected to exceed $1 billion.164 during and after the hurricanes katrina wilma and rita the american red cross had opened 1470 shelters and registered 3.8 million overnight stays none were allowed in new orleans however a total of 244000 red cross workers 95 of which were non-paid volunteers were utilized throughout these three hurricanes in addition 346980 comfort kits such as toothpaste soap washcloths and toys for children and 205360 cleanup kits containing brooms mops and bleach were distributed for mass care the organization served 68 million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers the red cross also had its disaster health services meet 596810 contacts and disaster mental health services met 826590 contacts red cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families hurricane katrina was the first natural disaster in the united states in which the american red cross utilized its safe and well family location website.165166 in the year following katrina's strike on the gulf coast the salvation army allocated donations of more than $365 million to serve more than 1.7 million people in nearly every state the organization's immediate response to hurricane katrina included more than 5.7 million hot meals and about 8.3 million sandwiches snacks and drinks served in and around new orleans its satern network of amateur radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25000 survivors salvation army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277000 individuals as part of the overall effort salvation army officers employees and volunteers contributed more than 900000 hours of service.167 analysis of new orleans levee failures on april 5 2006 months after independent investigators had demonstrated that levee failures were not caused by natural forces beyond intended design strength lieutenant general carl strock chief of engineers and commander of the corps of engineers testified before the united states senate subcommittee on energy and water that we have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.168 other factors may have contributed to the flooding according to the authors of catastrophe in the making island press 2009 the straight design and lack of outward flow into the gulf allowed the mississippi river-gulf outlet canal to become the perfect shortcut for salt-water intrusion which damaged buffering cypress forests and wetlands which historically had protected new orleans from storm surge.170 the army corps of engineers built and maintained the canal furthermore according to storm surge researcher hassan mashriqui the corps of engineers disputes these causalities.172 nonetheless in june 2008 the army corps of engineers new orleans district submitted a deep-draft de-authorization study of the mrgo which stated that an economic evaluation of channel navigation use does not demonstrate a federal interest in continued operation and maintenance of the channel. congress ordered the mrgo closed as a direct result many of the levees have been reconstructed since the time of katrina in reconstructing them precautions were taken to bring the levees up to modern building code standards and to ensure their safety for example in every situation possible the corps of engineers replaced i-walls with t-walls t-walls have a horizontal concrete base that protects against soil erosion underneath the floodwalls.173 however there are funding battles over the remaining levee improvements in february 2008 the bush administration requested that the state of louisiana pay about $1.5 billion of an estimated $7.2 billion for corps of engineers levee work in accordance with the principles of local cost sharing required by congress as early as the flood control act of 1928 a proposal which angered many louisiana leaders.174 on may 2 2008 louisiana gov bobby jindal used a speech to the national press club to request that president bush free up money to complete work on louisiana's levees bush promised to include the levee funding in his 2009 budget but rejected the idea of including the funding in a war bill which would pass sooner.175 media involvement as the u.s military and rescue services regained control over the city there were restrictions on the activity of the media on september 9 the military leader of the relief effort announced that reporters would have zero access to efforts to recover bodies in new orleans immediately following this announcement cnn filed a lawsuit and obtained a temporary restraining order against the ban the next day the government backed down and reversed the ban.182 retirement because of the large death toll and destruction of property along the gulf coast the name katrina was officially retired on april 6 2006 by the world meteorological organization at the request of the u.s government the name will never again be used for another north atlantic hurricane it was replaced by katia on list iii of the atlantic hurricane naming lists which was used in the 2011 atlantic hurricane season.183 studies concerning post-katrina victims an article published in the community mental health journal from january 2016 revealed information about a recent study on the psychosocial needs of hurricane katrina evacuees that temporarily resided in dallas texas more than one-fourth of the sample met the criteria for major depressive disorder mdd about one-third of the individuals received a referral to mental health services for meeting symptom criteria for incident mdd and ptsd.184 in a study published in maternal and child health journal five-to seven years after the disaster 308 new orleans pregnant women were interviewed about their exposure to katrina researchers found that there were associations between experiencing damage during katrina and birthweight thus researchers concluded that natural disasters may have long-term effects on pregnancy outcomes furthermore it was concluded that women who are most vulnerable to disaster may be more vulnerable to poor pregnancy outcome.185 from a september 2015 journal of current psychology a study examined the attitudes of older long-term residents of baton rouge louisiana toward displaced newcomers to their community after using multiple tests analyses and descriptive statistics the study suggested residents grew to become more patient tolerant and friendly towards newcomers the study also suggests however that residents felt more fearful and suspicious of the evacuees as well as the fact that they were being taken advantage of more.186 reconstruction reconstruction of each section of the southern portion of louisiana has been addressed in the army corps lacpr louisiana coastal protection and restoration final technical report which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas where buildings need to be elevated.187 the technical report includes the u.s army corps of engineers submitted the report to the u.s congress for consideration planning and response in mid-2009 see

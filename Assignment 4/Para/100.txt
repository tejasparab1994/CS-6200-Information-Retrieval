earth's rotation earth's rotation is the rotation of planet earth around its own axis earth rotates eastward in prograde motion as viewed from the north pole star polaris earth turns counterclockwise the north pole also known as the geographic north pole or terrestrial north pole is the point in the northern hemisphere where earth's axis of rotation meets its surface this point is distinct from earth's north magnetic pole the south pole is the other point where earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface in antarctica  contents  historyedit a more conventional picture was that supported by hicetas heraclides and ecphantus in the fourth century bce who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun in the third century bce aristarchus of samos suggested the sun's central place however aristotle in the fourth century bce criticized the ideas of philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation he established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth.4 this was accepted by most of those who came after in particular claudius ptolemy 2nd century ce who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotated.5 in medieval europe thomas aquinas accepted aristotle's view13 and so reluctantly did john buridan14 and nicole oresme15 in the fourteenth century not until nicolaus copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of earth's rotation begin to be established copernicus pointed out that if the movement of the earth is violent then the movement of the stars must be very much more so he acknowledged the contribution of the pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion for copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central sun.16 tycho brahe who produced accurate observations on which kepler based his laws used copernicus's work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary earth in 1600 william gilbert strongly supported the earth's rotation in his treatise on the earth's magnetism17 and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries.18 those like gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of the earth about the sun are often called semi-copernicans.19 a century after copernicus riccioli disputed the model of a rotating earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies;20 such deflections would later be called the coriolis effect however the contributions of kepler galileo and newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of the earth empirical testsedit the earth's rotation implies that the equator bulges and the poles are flattened in his principia newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230 and pointed to the 1673 pendulum measurements by richer as corroboration of the change in gravity21 but initial measurements of meridian lengths by picard and cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite however measurements by maupertuis and the french geodesic mission in the 1730s established the flattening thus confirming both newton and the copernican position.22 in the earth's rotating frame of reference a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference because of the coriolis effect falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release and projectiles veer right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern from the direction in which they are shot the coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale where it is responsible for the differing rotation direction of cyclones in the northern and southern hemispheres rotation period edit true solar dayedit earth's rotation period relative to the sun solar noon to solar noon is its true solar day or apparent solar day it depends on the earth's orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of earth's orbit both vary over thousands of years so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies generally it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two.n 2 the true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual taking about 10 seconds longer to do so conversely it is about 10 seconds shorter near aphelion it is about 20 seconds longer near a solstice when the projection of the sun's apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the sun to move through a greater angle than usual conversely near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about 20 seconds currently the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near 22 december by 30 mean solar seconds but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near 19 june when it is only 13 seconds longer the effects of the equinoxes shorten it near 26 march and 16 september by 18 seconds and 21 seconds respectively.242526 mean solar dayedit the average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day which contains 86400 mean solar seconds currently each of these seconds is slightly longer than an si second because earth's mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction the average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86400 si seconds.272829 random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms.3031 the mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by simon newcomb as the independent unit of time in his tables of the sun these tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983 so this second became known as the ephemeris second in 1967 the si second was made equal to the ephemeris second.32 the apparent solar time is a measure of the earth's rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of time stellar and sidereal dayedit earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars called its stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers is 86164.098 903 691 seconds of mean solar time ut1 23h 56m 4.098 903 691s 0.997 269 663 237 16 mean solar days.33n 3 earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox named sidereal day is 86164.090 530 832 88 seconds of mean solar time ut1 23h 56m 4.090 530 832 88s 0.997 269 566 329 08 mean solar days.33 thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.35 angular speededit changes in rotationedit change in rotational axisedit the earth's rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars inertial space the components of this motion are precession and nutation it also moves with respect to the earth's crust this is called polar motion precession is a rotation of the earth's rotation axis caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the sun moon and other bodies the polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the chandler wobble change in rotational velocityedit tidal interactionsedit over millions of years the earth's rotation slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the moon in this process angular momentum is slowly transferred to the moon at a rate proportional tor6displaystyle r^-6 whererdisplaystyle r is the orbital radius of the moon this process gradually increased the length of day to its current value and resulted in the moon being tidally locked with the earth this gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented with estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites a compilation of these measurements41 found the length of day to increase steadily from about 21 hours at 600myr ago42 to the current 24 hour value by counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides tidal frequencies and thus day lengths can be estimated much like counting tree rings though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older ages.43 resonant stabilizationedit the current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high implying the earth's rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past empirical data41 tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600myr ago some models suggest that the earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the precambrian.42 this day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally-driven atmospheric tide at this day length the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period this stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the marinoan or sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600myr ago citing the resemblance of simulated results and existing paleorotational data.44 global eventsedit additionally some large scale events such as the 2004 indian ocean earthquake have caused the rotation to speed up by around 3 microseconds by affecting the earth's moment of inertia.45 post-glacial rebound ongoing since the last ice age is also changing the distribution of the earth's mass thus affecting the moment of inertia of the earth and by the conservation of angular momentum the earth's rotation period.46 measurementedit the permanent monitoring of the earth's rotation is performed with very-long-baseline interferometry coordinated with the global positioning system satellite laser ranging and other satellite techniques this provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time precession and nutation.47 ancient observationsedit there are preserved observations of solar and lunar eclipses from babylonian astronomy and chinese astronomy beginning from the 8th century bce these observations as well as further astronomical historical records from astronomy in the medieval islamic world and elsewhere can be used to determine the actual changes in the rotation of the earth over the last 27 centuries the calculation to describe the place and time of eclipse is dependent on the rotation of the earth the ancient observations are consistent with the earth having rotated a significant fraction of a total turn than would result from today's value of the speed of rotation would indicate the earth was turning ever faster throughout the past the cumulative effect of the faster turn of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century 36525 days per century shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations scholars have combed the ancient records and calculated by modern models the magnitude of the long term historical slowing down of the earth's rotation.4849 originedit the earth's original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust rocks and gas that coalesced to form the solar system this primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the big bang as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas as this interstellar dust is heterogeneous any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planet.50 however if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the moon is correct this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the theia impact 4.5 billion years ago regardless of the speed and tilt of the earth's rotation before the impact it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact.51 tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu

orbital station-keeping in astrodynamics the orbital maneuvers made by thruster burns that are needed to keep a spacecraft in a particular assigned orbit are called orbital station-keeping for many earth satellites the effects of the non-keplerian forces i.e the deviations of the gravitational force of the earth from that of a homogeneous sphere gravitational forces from sun/moon solar radiation pressure and air-drag must be counteracted the deviation of earth's gravity field from that of a homogeneous sphere and gravitational forces from sun/moon will in general perturb the orbital plane for a sun-synchronous orbit the precession of the orbital plane caused by the oblateness of the earth is a desirable feature that is part of the mission design but the inclination change caused by the gravitational forces of sun/moon is undesirable for geostationary spacecraft the inclination change caused by the gravitational forces of sun/moon must be counteracted by a rather large expense of fuel as the inclination should be kept sufficiently small for the spacecraft to be tracked by a non-steerable antenna for spacecraft in low orbits the effects of atmospheric drag must often be compensated for for some missions this is needed simply to avoid re-entry for other missions typically missions for which the orbit should be accurately synchronized with earth rotation this is necessary to avoid the orbital period shortening solar radiation pressure will in general perturb the eccentricity i.e the eccentricity vector see orbital perturbation analysis spacecraft for some missions this must be actively counter-acted with manoeuvres for geostationary spacecraft the eccentricity must be kept sufficiently small for a spacecraft to be tracked with a non-steerable antenna also for earth observation spacecraft for which a very repetitive orbit with a fixed ground track is desirable the eccentricity vector should be kept as fixed as possible a large part of this compensation can be done by using a frozen orbit design but for the fine control manoeuvres with thrusters are needed for spacecraft in a halo orbit around a lagrangian point stationkeeping is even more fundamental as such an orbit is unstable without an active control with thruster burns the smallest deviation in position/velocity would result in the spacecraft leaving the orbit completely.1  contents  station-keeping in low earth orbitedit for a spacecraft in a very low orbit the atmospheric drag is sufficiently strong to cause a re-entry before the intended end of mission if orbit raising manoeuvres are not executed from time to time station-keeping for earth observation spacecraftedit station-keeping in geostationary orbitedit to extend the life-time of ageing geostationary spacecraft with little fuel left one sometimes discontinues the north-south control only continuing with the east-west control as seen from an observer on the rotating earth the spacecraft will then move north-south with a period of 24 hours when this north-south movement gets too large a steerable antenna is needed to track the spacecraft an example of thiswhen? is artemis.citation needed to save weight it is crucial for geo satellites to have the most fuel-efficient propulsion system some modern satellites are therefore employing a high specific impulse system like plasma or ion thrusters station-keeping at libration pointsedit orbits around libration points are dynamically unstable meaning small departures from equilibrium grow exponentially over time.1 as a result spacecraft in libration point orbits must use propulsion systems to perform orbital station-keeping the james webb space telescope needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around the earth-sun l2 which provides an upper limit to its designed lifetime it is being designed to carry enough for ten years.6 see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

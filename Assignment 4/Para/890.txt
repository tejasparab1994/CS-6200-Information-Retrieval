apsis in orbital mechanics the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the centers of mass of the central and orbiting body however in the case of spacecraft the family of terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital altitude of the spacecraft from the surface of the central body assuming a constant standard reference radius  contents  mathematical formulaeedit these formulae characterize the pericenter and apocenter of an orbit while in accordance with kepler's laws of planetary motion based on the conservation of angular momentum and the conservation of energy these two quantities are constant for a given orbit where note that for conversion from heights above the surface to distances between an orbit and its primary the radius of the central body has to be added and conversely the arithmetic mean of the two limiting distances is the length of the semi-major axis a the geometric mean of the two distances is the length of the semi-minor axis b the geometric mean of the two limiting speeds is which is the speed of a body in a circular orbit whose radius isadisplaystyle a terminologyedit the words pericenter and apocenter are often seen although periapsis/apoapsis are preferred in technical usage various related terms are used for other celestial objects the '-gee' '-helion and '-astron and '-galacticon forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the earth sun stars and the galactic center respectively the suffix '-jove is occasionally used for jupiter while '-saturnium has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for saturn the '-gee form is commonly used as a generic 'closest approach to planet term instead of specifically applying to the earth during the apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion referencing cynthia an alternative name for the greek moon goddess artemis were used when referring to the moon.4 regarding black holes the term peri/apomelasma from a greek root was used by physicist geoffrey a landis in 1998 before peri/aponigricon from a latin appeared in the scientific literature in 2002.5 terminology graphedit the following suffixes are added to peri and apo to form the terms for the nearest and farthest orbital distances from these objects perihelion and aphelion of the earthedit for the orbit of the earth around the sun the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations the variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the sun which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic the earth's eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system see milankovitch cycles on a very long time scale the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons and they make one complete cycle in 22000 to 26000 years there is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from earth that is called the apsidal precession this is closely related to the precession of the axis. the dates and times of the perihelions and aphelions for several past and future years are listed in the following table:7 planetary perihelion and aphelionedit the following table shows the distances of the planets and dwarf planets from the sun at their perihelion and aphelion.8 the following chart shows the range of distances of the planets dwarf planets and halley's comet from the sun distances of selected bodies of the solar system from the sun the left and right edges of each bar correspond to the perihelion and aphelion of the body respectively hence long bars denote high orbital eccentricity the radius of the sun is 0.7 million km and the radius of jupiter the largest planet is 0.07 million km both too small to resolve on this image the images below show the perihelion green dot and aphelion red dot points of the inner and outer planets the perihelion and aphelion points of the inner planets of the solar system the perihelion and aphelion points of the outer planets of the solar system see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

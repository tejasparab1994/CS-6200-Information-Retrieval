polar low  contents  historyedit polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes the most active polar lows are found over certain ice-free maritime areas in or near the arctic during the winter such as the norwegian sea barents sea labrador sea and gulf of alaska however some polar lows have been found in the sea of japan polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air-sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller however vigorous polar lows can be found over the southern ocean structureedit formationedit frequencyedit polar lows can occur at any time during the year but cyclogenesis takes on different characteristics depending on season winter cyclonesedit although cyclonic activity is most prevalent in the eurasian arctic with approximately 15 cyclones per winter polar lows also occur in greenland and the canadian arctic summer cyclonesedit in stark contrast summer polar cyclones may not form for several years and tend to be weaker than winter cyclones.4 nevertheless summer cyclones can still rival concurrent tropical cyclones within the same hemisphere in pressure such as 968 mb for the august 2016 cyclone and 962 mb for the great arctic cyclone of 2012 one summer cyclone swept across the us in august 2016 with a central pressure of 968 mb5 these cyclones cause arctic sea ice to melt as they kick up winds that cause ice to break up the lowest extent of ice in the arctic ever recorded was 2012 when the great arctic cyclone of 2012 hit the region summer cyclones are not well studied and seldom destructive in terms of lives or property as they typically take place in sparsely populated areas other effects include driving out hot humid summer air with drier air that may linger.5 the only infrastructure damage that occurs as a direct result of a polar cyclone is to oil and gas rigs present throughout the antarctic ocean sometimes known as the southern ocean some cargo and shipping vessels are also affected although there are minimal or no reports of losses in recent years as the result of a polar low forecastingedit polar lows are very difficult to forecast and a nowcasting approach is often used with the systems being advected with the mid-tropospheric flow numerical weather prediction models are only just getting the horizontal and vertical resolution to represent these systems see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

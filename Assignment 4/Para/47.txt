derecho derechos can cause hurricane-force winds tornadoes heavy rains and flash floods convection-induced winds take on a bow echo backward c form of squall line forming in an area of wind divergence in upper levels of the troposphere within a region of low-level warm air advection and rich low-level moisture they travel quickly in the direction of movement of their associated storms similar to an outflow boundary gust front except that the wind is sustained and increases in strength behind the front generally exceeding hurricane-force a warm-weather phenomenon derechos occur mostly in summer especially during june july and august in the northern hemisphere within areas of moderately strong instability and moderately strong vertical wind shear they may occur at any time of the year and occur as frequently at night as during the daylight hours  contents  etymologyedit derecho comes from the spanish word in adjective form for straight or direct in contrast with a tornado which is a twisted wind.2 the word was first used in the american meteorological journal in 1888 by gustavus detlef hinrichs in a paper describing the phenomenon and based on a significant derecho event that crossed iowa on 31 july 1877.3 developmentedit organized areas of thunderstorm activity reinforce pre-existing frontal zones and can outrun cold fronts the resultant mesoscale convective system mcs forms at the point of the best upper level divergence in the wind pattern in the area of best low level inflow.clarification needed4 the convection then moves east and toward the equator into the warm sector parallel to low-level thickness lines with the mean tropospheric flow when the convection is strong linear or curved the mcs is called a squall line with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise.5 derechos are squall lines that are bow or spearhead-shaped on weather radar and thus also are called bow echoes or spearhead radar echoes squall lines typically bow out due to the formation of a mesoscale high pressure system which forms within the stratiform rain area behind the initial line this high pressure area is formed due to strong descending motion behind the squall line and could come in the form of a downburst.6 the size of the bow may vary and the storms associated with the bow may die and redevelop classification and criteriaedit there are four types of derechos characteristicsedit some derechos develop a radar signature resembling that of a hurricane in the low levels they may have a central eye free of precipitation with a minimum central pressure and surrounding bands of strong convection but are really associated with an mcs developing multiple squall lines and are not tropical in nature these storms have a warm core like other mesoscale convective systems one such derecho occurred across the midwestern u.s on 21 july 2003 an area of convection developed across eastern iowa near a weak stationary/warm front and ultimately matured taking on the shape of a wavy squall line across western ohio and southern indiana the system re-intensified after leaving the ohio valley starting to form a large hook with occasional hook echoes appearing along its eastern side a surface low pressure center formed and became more impressive later in the day.15 locationedit damage riskedit unlike other thunderstorms which typically can be heard in the distance when approaching a derecho seems to strike suddenly within minutes extremely high winds can arise strong enough to knock over highway signs and topple large trees these winds are accompanied by spraying rain and frequent lightning from all directions it is dangerous to drive under these conditions especially at night because of blowing debris and obstructed roadways downed wires and widespread power outages are likely but not always a factor a derecho moves through quickly but can do much damage in a short time since derechos occur during warm months and often in places with cold winter climates people who are most at risk are those involved in outdoor activities campers hikers and motorists are most at risk because of falling trees toppled over by straight-line winds wide swaths of forest have been felled by such storms people who live in mobile homes are also at risk mobile homes that are not anchored to the ground may be overturned from the high winds across the united states michigan and new york have incurred a significant portion of the fatalities from derechos prior to hurricane katrina the death tolls from derechos and hurricanes were comparable for the united states.8 derechos may also severely damage an urban area's electrical distribution system especially if these services are routed above ground the derecho that struck chicago illinois on 11 july 2011 left more than 860000 people without electricity.18 the june 2012 north american derecho took out electrical power to more than 3.7 million customers starting in the midwestern united states across the central appalachians into the mid-atlantic states during a heat wave.19 see alsoedit referencesedit notes further reading external

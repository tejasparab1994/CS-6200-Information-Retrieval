brazil brazil's economy is the world's eighth-largest by both nominal gdp and gdp ppp as of 2017update.1920 a member of the brics group brazil until 2010 had one of the world's fastest growing major economies with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence.21 brazil's national development bank plays an important role for the country's economic growth.22 brazil is a founding member of the united nations the g20 brics union of south american nations mercosul organization of american states organization of ibero-american states and the cplp brazil is a regional power in latin america and a middle power in international affairs23 with some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power and has been characterised as a potential superpower.24 one of the world's major breadbaskets brazil has been the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.25  contents  etymology it is likely that the word brazil comes from the portuguese word for brazilwood a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast.26 in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from latin brasa ember and the suffix -il from -iculum or -ilium.27 as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil.28 throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples mostly tupi along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders mostly portuguese but also french in return for assorted european consumer goods.29 the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the land of the holy cross terra da santa cruz30 but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the land of brazil terra do brasil on account of the brazilwood trade.31 the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name some early sailors called it the land of parrots.32 in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called pindorama this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning land of the palm trees.33 history pre-cabraline era before the arrival of the europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs.39 these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war.4041 while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions.39 slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations.42 portuguese colonization however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america.4647 in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.48495051 by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazil's most important exportation product4452 and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western africa53 not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique had become its largest import5455 to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar.5657 by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline58 and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy fostering a brazilian gold rush59 which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world.60 this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.61 the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugal's wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of palmares65 and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas conspiracy.66 united kingdom with portugal independent empire during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 185084 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished.85 on 15 november 1889 worn out by years of economic stagnation in attrition with the majority of army officers as well as with rural and financial elites for different reasons the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.89 early republic the early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.90 in 1894 following the unfoldings of two severe crises an economic along with a military one the republican civilians rose to power.919293 the foreign policy during vargas years was marked by the antecedents and occurrence of world war ii having brazil remained neutral until august 1942 when the country entered on the allied side117118 after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy in the context of the strategic dispute over the south atlantic.119 in addition to its participation in the battle of the atlantic brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the italian campaign.120 with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with democracy being reinstated by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years earlier.121 vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis after having returned to power by election in 1950.122123 contemporary era the new regime was intended to be transitory131 but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968.132 oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime but also reached institutional opponents artists journalists and other members of civil society133134 inside and outside the country through the infamous operation condor.135136 despite its brutality like other totalitarian regimes due to an economic boom known as an economic miracle the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.137 slowly however the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas138 plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable which from the regime side was led by generals geisel and golbery.139 with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979 brazil began its slow return to democracy which was completed during the 1980s.83 collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso minister of finance in 1994 cardoso produced a highly successful plano real142 that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally granted stability to the brazilian economy143144 leading cardoso to be elected that year and again in 1998.145 enhanced by a political and economic crises with evidence of involvement by politicians from all the primary political parties in several bribery and tax evasion schemes150151 with large street protests for and against her152 rousseff was impeached by the brazilian congress in 2016.5153 in 2017 the supreme court has asked for the investigation of 71 brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers in president michel temer's cabinet allegedly linked to the petrobras corruption scandal.154 president temer is himself accused of corruption.155 geography

amazonas biodiversity and environment brazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems such as the amazon rainforest recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world169 with the atlantic forest and the cerrado sustaining the greatest biodiversity.170 in the south the araucaria pine forest grows under temperate conditions.170 the rich wildlife of brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in brazil could approach four million mostly invertebrates.170 larger mammals include carnivores pumas jaguars ocelots rare bush dogs and foxes and herbivores peccaries tapirs anteaters sloths opossums and armadillos deer are plentiful in the south and many species of new world monkeys are found in the northern rain forests.170171 concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues.172 brazil's amazon basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species including the red-bellied piranha despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger biodiversity can contribute to agriculture livestock forestry and fisheries extraction however almost all economically exploited species of plants such as soybeans and coffee or animals such as chickens are imported from other countries and the economic use of native species still crawls in the brazilian gdp the forest sector represents just over 1 and fishing 0.4% the natural heritage of brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture logging mining resettlement oil and gas extraction over-fishing wildlife trade dams and infrastructure water pollution climate change fire and invasive species.169 in many areas of the country the natural environment is threatened by development.173 construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape.172174 at least 70 dams are said to be planned for the amazon region including the controversial belo monte hydroelectric dam.175 blue poison dart frog found in the forests of the far northern brazil toco toucan a brazilian symbol a country with one of the largest variety of birds in the world lear's macaw

a presidential system.18 the president is both head of state and head of government of the union and is elected for a four-year term18 with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term the current president is michel temer who replaced dilma rousseff after her impeachment.176 the president appoints the ministers of state who assist in government.18 legislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in brazil the national congress is the federation's bicameral legislature consisting of the chamber of deputies and the federal senate judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively brazil is a democracy according to the democracy index 2010.177 the brazilian federation is the indissoluble union of the states the municipalities and the federal district.18 the union the states and the federal district and the municipalities are the spheres of government the federation is set on five fundamental principles:18 sovereignty citizenship dignity of human beings the social values of labour and freedom of enterprise and political pluralism the classic tripartite branches of government executive legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system are formally established by the constitution.18 the executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state/federal district spheres all members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.178179180 judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.178 for most of its democratic history brazil has had a multi-party system proportional representation voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.18 together with several smaller parties four political parties stand out workers party pt brazilian social democracy party psdb brazilian democratic movement party pmdb and democrats dem fifteen political parties are represented in congress it is common for politicians to switch parties and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.181 almost all governmental and administrative functions are exercised by authorities and agencies affiliated to the executive law brazilian law is based on the civil law legal system182 and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice most of brazilian law is codified although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part playing a complementary role court decisions set out interpretive guidelines however they are seldom binding on other specific cases doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases this system has been criticized over the last few decades for the slow pace of decision-making lawsuits on appeal may take several years to resolve and in some cases more than a decade elapses before definitive rulings.186 nevertheless the supreme federal tribunal was the first court in the world to transmit its sessions on television and also via youtube.187188 more recently in december 2009 the supreme court adopted twitter to display items on the day planner of the ministers to inform the daily actions of the court and the most important decisions made by them.189 military the armed forces of brazil are the second largest in latin america by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment.190 it consists of the brazilian army including the army aviation command the brazilian navy including the marine corps and naval aviation and the brazilian air force brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces estimated at more than 1.6 million reservist annually.191 numbering close to 236000 active personnel192 the brazilian army has the largest number of armored vehicles in south america including armored transports and tanks193 it is also unique in latin america for its large elite forces specializing in unconventional missions the brazilian special operations command194195196 and the versatile strategic rapid action force made up of highly mobilized and prepared special operations brigade infantry brigade parachutist197198 1st jungle infantry battalion airmobile199 and 12th brigade light infantry airmobile200 able to act anywhere in the country on short notice to counter external aggression.201 the states military police and the military firefighters corps are described as an ancillary forces of the army by the constitution but are under the control of each state's governor.18 the air force it is the largest in latin america has about 700 manned aircraft in service and effective about 67000 personnel.205 brazil has not been invaded since 1865 during the paraguayan war.206 additionally brazil has no contested territorial disputes with any of its neighbours207 and neither does it have rivalries like chile and bolivia have with each other.208209 the brazilian military has also three times intervened militarily to overthrow the brazilian government.210 it has built a tradition of participating in un peacekeeping missions such as in haiti and east timor.211 foreign policy brazil's international relations are based on article 4 of the federal constitution which establishes non-intervention self-determination international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.212 according to the constitution the president has ultimate authority over foreign policy while the congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties as well as legislation relating to brazilian foreign policy.213 brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a regional power in latin america a leader among developing countries and an emerging world power.214 brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism peaceful dispute settlement and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.215 an increasingly well-developed tool of brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries.216 brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.216 total aid is estimated to be around $1 billion per year that includes:216 in addition brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in haiti $350 million and makes in-kind contributions to the world food programme $300 million.216 this is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies the scale of this aid places it on par with china and india.216 the brazilian south-south aid has been described as a global model in waiting.217 law enforcement and crime in brazil the constitution establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement federal police department federal highway police federal railroad police military police and civil police of these the first three are affiliated with federal authorities and the last two are subordinate to state governments all police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers.18 the national public security force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.218 brazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world behind only china and the united states with an estimated total of approximately 700000 prisoners around the country june 2014 an increase of about 300 compared to the index registered in 1992.222 the high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the brazilian prison system leading to a shortfall of about two hundred thousand accommodations.223 administrative divisions the states and the federal district may be grouped into regions northern northeast central-west southeast and southern the brazilian regions are merely geographical not political or administrative divisions and they do not have any specific form of government although defined by law brazilian regions are useful mainly for statistical purposes and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects municipalities as the states have autonomous administrations collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the union and state government.18 each has a mayor and an elected legislative body but no separate court of law indeed a court of law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called comarca county economy brazil is the largest national economy in latin america the world's ninth largest economy and the eighth largest in purchasing power parity ppp according to the 2017 estimates brazil has a mixed economy with abundant natural resources after rapid growth in preceding decades the country entered an ongoing recession in 2014 amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests its gdp ppp per capita was $15048 in 2016225 putting brazil in the 77th position according to imf data active in agricultural mining manufacturing and service sectors brazil has a labor force of over a 107 million ranking 6th worldwide and unemployment of 6.2 ranking 64th worldwide.226 the country has been expanding its presence in international financial and commodities markets and is one of a group of four emerging economies called the bric countries.227 brazil has been the world's largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.25 brazil has become the fourth largest car market in the world.229 major export products include aircraft electrical equipment automobiles ethanol textiles footwear iron ore steel coffee orange juice soybeans and corned beef.230 in total brazil ranks 23rd worldwide in value of exports brazil pegged its currency the real to the u.s dollar in 1994 however after the east asian financial crisis the russian default in 1998231 and the series of adverse financial events that followed it the central bank of brazil temporarily changed its monetary policy to a managed-float232 scheme while undergoing a currency crisis until definitively changing the exchange regime to free-float in january 1999.233 between 1993 and 2010 7012 mergers  acquisitions with a total known value of $707 billion with the involvement of brazilian firms have been announced.239 the year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with 115 billion usd of transactions the largest transaction with involvement of brazilian companies has been cia vale do rio doce acquired inco in a tender offer valued at us$18.9 billion corruption costs brazil almost $41 billion a year alone with 69.9 of the country's firms identifying the issue as a major constraint in successfully penetrating the global market.240 local government corruption is so prevalent that voters perceive it as a problem only if it surpasses certain levels and only if a local media e.g a radio station is present to divulge the findings of corruption charges.241 initiatives like this exposure strengthen awareness which is indicated by the transparency international's corruption perceptions index ranking brazil 69th out of 178 countries in 2012.242 the purchasing power in brazil is eroded by the so-called brazil cost.243 components and energy brazil's diversified economy includes agriculture industry and a wide range of services.244 agriculture and allied sectors like forestry logging and fishing accounted for 5.1 of the gross domestic product in 2007.245 brazil is one of the largest producer of oranges coffee sugar cane cassava and sisal soybeans and papayas.246 brazil is the world's tenth largest energy consumer with much of its energy coming from renewable sources particularly hydroelectricity and ethanol the itaipu dam is the world's largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation.248 the first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005.249 recent oil discoveries in the pre-salt layer have opened the door for a large increase in oil production.250 the governmental agencies responsible for the energy policy are the ministry of mines and energy the national council for energy policy the national agency of petroleum natural gas and biofuels and the national agency of electricity.251 tourism in terms of the 2015 travel and tourism competitiveness index ttci which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries brazil ranked in the 28st place at the world's level third in the americas after canada and united states.257258 brazil's main competitive advantages are its natural resources which ranked 1st on this criteria out of all countries considered and ranked 23rd for its cultural resources due to its many world heritage sites the ttci report notes brazil's main weaknesses its ground transport infrastructure remains underdeveloped ranked 116th with the quality of roads ranking in 105th place and the country continues to suffer from a lack of price competitiveness ranked 114th due in part to high ticket taxes and airport charges as well as high prices and high taxation safety and security have improved significantly 75th in 2011 up from 128th in 2008.258 despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues the number of brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003 resulting in a net negative foreign exchange balance as more money is spent abroad by brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting brazil tourism expenditures abroad grew from usd 5.8 billion in 2006 to usd 8.2 billion in 2007 a 42 increase representing a net deficit of usd 3.3 billion in 2007 as compared to usd 1.5 billion in 2006 a 125 increase from the previous year.264 this trend is caused by brazilians taking advantage of the stronger real to travel and making relatively cheaper expenditures abroad.264 brazilians traveling overseas in 2006 represented 4 of the country's population.265 in 2005 tourism contributed with 3.2 of the country's revenues from exports of goods and services and represented 7 of direct and indirect employment in the brazilian economy.266 in 2006 direct employment in the sector reached 1.9 million people.267 domestic tourism is a fundamental market segment for the industry as 51 million people traveled throughout the country in 2005268 and direct revenues from brazilian tourists reached usd 22 billion269 5.6 times more receipts than international tourists in 2005 infrastructure science and technology technological research in brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies.271 brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the oswaldo cruz institute the butantan institute the air force's aerospace technical center the brazilian agricultural research corporation and the inpe.272273 the brazilian space agency has the most advanced space program in latin america with significant resources to launch vehicles and manufacture of satellite.274 owner of relative technological sophistication the country develops submarines aircraft as well as being involved in space research having a vehicle launch center light and being the only country in the southern hemisphere the integrate team building international space station iss.275 the country is also a pioneer in the search for oil in deep water from where extracts 73 of its reserves uranium is enriched at the resende nuclear fuel factory mostly for research purposes as brazil obtains 88 from its electricity from hydroelectricity276 and the country's first nuclear submarine will be delivered in 2015 by france.277 brazil is one of the three countries in latin america278 with an operational synchrotron laboratory a research facility on physics chemistry material science and life sciences and brazil is the only latin american country to have a semiconductor company with its own fabrication plant the ceitec.279 according to the global information technology report 2009-2010 of the world economic forum brazil is the 61 world's largest developer of information technology.280 transport water supply and sanitation among the achievements in the water supply and sanitation sector is an increase in access to water piped on premises from 79 to 92 between 1990 and 2010 an increase in access to improved sanitation from 68 to 79 in the same period;303 a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation infrastructure a high level of cost recovery compared to most other developing countries as well as a number of notable technical and financial innovations such as condominial sewerage and an output-based subsidy for treated wastewater called prodes among the challenges is the still high number of poor brazilians living in urban slums favela and in rural areas without access to piped water or sanitation water scarcity in the northeast of brazil water pollution especially in the south-east of the country the low share of collected wastewater that is being treated 35 in 2000 and long-standing tensions between the federal state and municipal governments about their respective roles in the sector health the brazilian public health system the unified health system sus is managed and provided by all levels of government304 being the largest system of this type in the world.305 on the other hand private healthcare systems play a complementary role.306 public health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free however the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes and the country spends about 9 of its gdp on expenditures in the area in 2009 the brazilian territory had 1.72 doctors and 2.4 hospital beds for every 1000 inhabitants.citation needed despite all the progress made since the creation of the universal health care system in 1988 there are still several public health problems in brazil in 2006 the main points to be solved were the high infant 2.51% and maternal mortality rates 73.1 deaths per 1000 births the number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases 151.7 deaths per 100000 inhabitants and cancer 72.7 deaths per 100000 inhabitants also has a considerable impact on the health of the brazilian population finally external but preventable factors such as car accidents violence and suicide caused 14.9 of all deaths in the country.307 the brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the world health organization who in 2000.308 education the federal constitution and the law of guidelines and bases of national education determine that the federal government states federal district and municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources the constitution reserves 25 of the state budget and 18 of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education.309 according to the ibge in 2011 the literacy rate of the population was 90.4% meaning that 13 million 9.6 of population people are still illiterate in the country functional illiteracy has reached 21.6 of the population.310 illiteracy is highest in the northeast where 19.9 of the population is illiterate.311 higher education starts with undergraduate or sequential courses which may offer different options of specialization in academic or professional careers depending on the choice students can improve their educational background with courses of post-graduate studies or broad sense to attend a higher education institution is required by law of guidelines and bases of education completing all levels of education suited to the needs of all students of teaching kindergarten elementary and medium provided the student does not hold any disability whether physical mental visual or hearing media and communication radio broadcasting began on 7 september 1922 with a speech by then president pessoa and was formalized on 20 april 1923 with the creation of radio society of rio de janeiro.317 television in brazil began officially on 18 september 1950 with the founding of tv tupi by assis chateaubriand.318 since then television has grown in the country creating large public networks such as globo sbt record and bandeirantes today it is the most important factor in popular culture of brazilian society indicated by research showing that as much as 67%319320 of the general population follow the same daily soap opera broadcast digital television using the sbtvd standard based on the japanese standard isdb-t was adopted 29 june 2006 and launched on 2 november 2007.321 in may 2010 brazil launched tv brasil internacional an international television station initially broadcasting to 49 countries.322 demographics race and ethnicity in 2007 the national indian foundation estimated that brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes up from their estimate of 40 in 2005 brazil is believed to have the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.336 since the arrival of the portuguese in 1500 considerable miscegenation between amerindians europeans and africans has taken place in all regions of the country with european ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population accounting for between 65 to 77%.337338339340 race and ethnicity in brazil341342343 brazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines although a high income disparity is found between race groups so racism and classism can be conflated socially significant closeness to one racial group is taken in account more in the basis of appearance phenotypes rather than ancestry to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups.344 socioeconomic factors are also significant because a minority of pardos are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward.345 skin color and facial features do not line quite well with ancestry usually afro-brazilians are evenly mixed and european ancestry is dominant in whites and pardos with a significant non-european contribution but the individual variation is great.340346347348 the brown population officially called pardo in portuguese also colloquially moreno349350 is a broad category that includes caboclos assimilated amerindians in general and descendants of whites and natives mulatos descendants of primarily whites and afro-brazilians and cafuzos descendants of afro-brazilians and natives.349350351352353 people of considerable amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the northern northeastern and center-western regions.354 religion religion in brazil was formed from the meeting of the catholic church with the religious traditions of enslaved african peoples and indigenous peoples.361 this confluence of faiths during the portuguese colonization of brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of brazilian catholic church characterized by traditional portuguese festivities362 and in some instances allan kardec's spiritism a religion which incorporates elements of spiritualism and christianity religious pluralism increased during the 20th century363 and the protestant community has grown to include over 22 of the population.364 the most common protestant denominations are pentecostal and evangelical ones other protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the baptists seventh-day adventists lutherans and the reformed tradition.365 roman catholicism is the country's predominant faith brazil has the world's largest catholic population.369 according to the 2000 demographic census the pnad survey does not inquire about religion 73.57 of the population followed roman catholicism 15.41 protestantism 1.33 kardecist spiritism 1.22 other christian denominations 0.31 afro-brazilian religions 0.13 buddhism 0.05 judaism 0.02 islam 0.01 amerindian religions 0.59 other religions undeclared or undetermined while 7.35 have no religion.370 urbanization language the official language of brazil is portuguese380 article 13 of the constitution of the federal republic of brazil which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers radio television and for business and administrative purposes the most famous exception to this is a strong sign language law that was passed by the national congress of brazil legally recognized in 2002381 the law was regulated in 2005.382 the law mandates the use of the brazilian sign language more commonly known by its portuguese acronym libras in education and government services the language must be taught as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula libras teachers instructors and translators are recognized professionals schools and health services must provide access inclusion to deaf people.383 brazilian portuguese has had its own development mostly similar to 16th-century central and southern dialects of european portuguese384 despite a very substantial number of portuguese colonial settlers and more recent immigrants coming from northern regions and in minor degree portuguese macaronesia with a few influences from the amerindian and african languages especially west african and bantu restricted to the vocabulary only.385 as a resultcitation needed the language is somewhat different mostly in phonology from the language of portugal and other portuguese-speaking countries the dialects of the other countries partly because of the more recent end of portuguese colonialism in these regions have a closer connection to contemporary european portuguese these differences are comparable to those between american and british english.385 brazil is the only portuguese-speaking nation in the americas making the language an important part of brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its spanish-speaking neighbors.386 in 1990 the community of portuguese language countries cplp which included representatives from all

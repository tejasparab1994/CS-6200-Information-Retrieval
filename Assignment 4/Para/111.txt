latitude  contents  preliminariesedit two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude in the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses the second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface the simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid the definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface the latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the iso 19111 standard.a since there are many different reference ellipsoids the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique this is stressed in the iso standard which states that without the full specification of the coordinate reference system coordinates that is latitude and longitude are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst this is of great importance in accurate applications such as a global positioning system gps but in common usage where high accuracy is not required the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated the precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the earth either to set up theodolites or to determine gps satellite orbits the study of the figure of the earth together with its gravitational field is the science of geodesy this article relates to coordinate systems for the earth it may be extended to cover the moon planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature latitude on the sphereedit the graticule on the sphereedit the latitude as defined in this way for the sphere is often termed the spherical latitude to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article named latitudes on the earthedit besides the equator four other parallels are of significance the plane of the earth's orbit about the sun is called the ecliptic and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth is the equatorial plane the angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt the obliquity or the inclination of the ecliptic and it is conventionally denoted by i the latitude of the tropical circles is equal to i and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement 90  i the axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current epoch the time variation is discussed more fully in the article on axial tilt.b the figure shows the geometry of a cross-section of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the earth and the sun at the december solstice when the sun is overhead at some point of the tropic of capricorn the south polar latitudes below the antarctic circle are in daylight whilst the north polar latitudes above the arctic circle are in night the situation is reversed at the june solstice when the sun is overhead at the tropic of cancer only at latitudes in between the two tropics is it possible for the sun to be directly overhead at the zenith on map projections there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear the examples below show the named parallels as red lines on the commonly used mercator projection and the transverse mercator projection on the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical both are complicated curves  meridian distance on the sphereedit latitude on the ellipsoidedit ellipsoidsedit the geometry of the ellipsoidedit many other parameters see ellipse ellipsoid appear in the study of geodesy geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set a b f and e both f and e are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations they are of the order 1/300 and 0.08 respectively values for a number of ellipsoids are given in figure of the earth reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the inverse flattening 1/f for example the defining values for the wgs84 ellipsoid used by all gps devices are2 from which are derived geodetic and geocentric latitudesedit the graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere the normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre except for points on the equator or at the poles but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane the terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing length of a degree of latitudeedit the distance from the equator to the pole is the evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection it can be evaluated by expanding the integral by the binomial series and integrating term by term see meridian arc for details the length of the meridian arc between two given latitudes is given by replacing the limits of the integral by the latitudes concerned the length of a small meridian arc is given by45 the variation of this distance with latitude on wgs84 is shown in the table along with the length of a degree of longitude east-west distance a calculator for any latitude is provided by the u.s government's national geospatial-intelligence agency nga.6 historically a nautical mile was defined as the length of one minute of arc along a meridian of a spherical earth an ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude this was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1852 metres auxiliary latitudesedit there are six auxiliary latitudes that have applications to special problems in geodesy geophysics and the theory of map projections the definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes like the geodetic latitude can be extended to define a three-dimensional geographic coordinate system as discussed below the remaining latitudes are not used in this way they are used only as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid their numerical values are not of interest for example no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the eiffel tower the expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude the semi-major axis a and the eccentricity e for inverses see below. the forms given are apart from notational variants those in the standard reference for map projections namely map projections a working manual by j p snyder.7 derivations of these expressions may be found in adams8 and online publications by osborne4 and rapp.5 geocentric latitudeedit reduced or parametric latitudeedit the alternative name arises from the parameterization of the equation of the ellipse describing a meridian section in terms of cartesian coordinates p the distance from the minor axis and z the distance above the equatorial plane the equation of the ellipse is the cartesian coordinates of the point are parameterized by cayley suggested the term parametric latitude because of the form of these equations.11 the reduced latitude is not used in the theory of map projections its most important application is in the theory of ellipsoid geodesics vincenty karney.12 rectifying latitudeedit and the length of the meridian quadrant from the equator to the pole the polar distance is using the rectifying latitude to define a latitude on a sphere of radius defines a projection from the ellipsoid to the sphere such that all meridians have true length and uniform scale the sphere may then be projected to the plane with an equirectangular projection to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale an example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the equidistant conic projection snyder section 16.7 the rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the transverse mercator projection authalic latitudeedit where and and the radius of the sphere is taken as conformal latitudeedit where gdx is the gudermannian function see also mercator projection. the conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere so that the shape of small elements is well preserved a further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane this is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection for example the 'exact version of the transverse mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection it does however involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane isometric latitudeedit inverse formulae and seriesedit numerical comparison of auxiliary latitudesedit latitude and coordinate systemsedit the geodetic latitude or any of the auxiliary latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid to define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions three latitudes are used in this way the geodetic geocentric and reduced latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively geodetic coordinatesedit spherical polar coordinatesedit ellipsoidal coordinatesedit coordinate conversionsedit the relations between the above coordinate systems and also cartesian coordinates are not presented here the transformation between geodetic and cartesian coordinates may be found in geographic coordinate conversion the relation of cartesian and spherical polars is given in spherical coordinate system the relation of cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in torge.3 astronomical latitudeedit in general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid the angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy.314 the reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is because the geoid is an idealized theoretical shape at mean sea level points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly also the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces which the theoretical geoid averages out astronomical latitude is not to be confused with declination the coordinate astronomers use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the celestial equator see equatorial coordinates nor with ecliptic latitude the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the ecliptic see ecliptic coordinates see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more

storm surge a storm surge or storm tide is a coastal flood or tsunami-like phenomenon of rising water commonly associated with low pressure weather systems such as tropical cyclones and strong extratropical cyclones the severity of which is affected by the shallowness and orientation of the water body relative to storm path as well as the timing of tides most casualties during tropical cyclones occur as the result of storm surges it is a measure of the rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement related to tides the two main meteorological factors contributing to a storm surge are a long fetch of winds spiraling inward toward the storm and a low-pressure-induced dome of water drawn up under and trailing the storm's center  contents  historic storm surgesedit the deadliest storm surge on record was the 1970 bhola cyclone which killed up to 500000 people in the area of the bay of bengal the low-lying coast of the bay of bengal is particularly vulnerable to surges caused by tropical cyclones.1 the deadliest storm surge in the twenty-first century was caused by the cyclone nargis which killed more than 138000 people in myanmar in may 2008 the next deadliest in this century was caused by the typhoon haiyan yolanda which killed more than 6000 people in the central philippines in 2013234 and resulted in economic losses estimated at $14 billion usd.5 mechanicsedit at least five processes can be involved in altering tide levels during storms strong surface winds cause surface currents at a 45 angle to the wind direction by an effect known as the ekman spiral wind stresses cause a phenomenon referred to as wind set-up which is the tendency for water levels to increase at the downwind shore and to decrease at the upwind shore intuitively this is caused by the storm blowing the water toward one side of the basin in the direction of its winds because the ekman spiral effects spread vertically through the water the effect is inversely proportional to depth the pressure effect and the wind set-up on an open coast will be driven into bays in the same way as the astronomical tide.11 the earth's rotation causes the coriolis effect which bends currents to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere when this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore it can amplify the surge and when it bends the current away from the shore it has the effect of lessening the surge.11 the effect of waves while directly powered by the wind is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents powerful wind whips up large strong waves in the direction of its movement.11 although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore when waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach they carry considerable water shoreward as they break the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.12 other processesedit for a given topography and bathymetry the surge height is not solely affected by peak wind speed the size of the storm also affects the peak surge with any storm the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force for the same peak wind speed when the storm covers more area storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter.15 extratropical stormsedit similar to tropical cyclones extra-tropical storms cause an offshore rise of water however unlike most tropical cyclone storm surges extra-tropical storms can cause higher water levels across a large area for longer periods of time depending on the system measuring surgeedit surge can be measured directly at coastal tidal stations as the difference between the forecast tide and the observed rise of water.16 another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone this was first tested for hurricane rita in 2005.17 these types of sensors can be placed in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.18 after surge from a cyclone has receded teams of surveyors map high-water marks hwm on land in a rigorous and detailed process that includes photographs and written descriptions of the marks hwms denote the location and elevation of flood waters from a storm event when hwms are analyzed if the various components of the water height can be broken out so that the portion attributable to surge can be identified then that mark can be classified as storm surge otherwise it is classified as storm tide hwms on land are referenced to a vertical datum a reference coordinate system during evaluation hwms are divided into four categories based on the confidence in the mark only hwms evaluated as excellent are used by national hurricane center in post-storm analysis of the surge.19 two different measures are used for storm tide and storm surge measurements storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum ngvd 29 or navd 88 since storm surge is defined as the rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides storm surge is measured using tidal predictions with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge since tides are a localized phenomenon storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level msl at that location then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.1619 sloshedit to allow for track or forecast uncertainties usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated to create a map of moms or maximum of maximums.22 for hurricane evacuation studies a family of storms with representative tracks for the region and varying intensity eye diameter and speed are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence the results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand slosh runs these studies have been completed by the united states army corps of engineers under contract to the federal emergency management agency for several states and are available on their hurricane evacuation studies hes website.23 they include coastal county maps shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane that will result in flooding in each area of the county.24 mitigationedit although meteorological surveys alert about hurricanes or severe storms in the areas where the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high there are specific storm surge warnings these have been implemented for instance in the netherlands25 spain2627 the united states2829 and the united kingdom.30 a prophylactic method introduced after the north sea flood of 1953 is the construction of dams and storm-surge barriers flood barriers they are open and allow free passage but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge major storm surge barriers are the oosterscheldekering and maeslantkering in the netherlands which are part of the delta works project the thames barrier protecting london and the saint petersburg dam in russia another modern development in use in the netherlands is the creation of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures restrained in position by vertical pylons.31 such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion for mainland areas storm surge is more of a threat when the storm strikes land from seaward rather than approaching from landward.32 reverse storm surgeedit water can also be sucked away from shore prior to a storm surge this was the case on the western florida coast in 2017 just before hurricane irma made landfall uncovering land usually underwater.33 this phenomenon is known as a reverse storm surge34 or a negative storm surge.35 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation

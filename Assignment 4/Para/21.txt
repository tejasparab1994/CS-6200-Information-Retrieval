cumulonimbus cloud cumulonimbus from the latin cumulus heap and nimbus rainstorm storm cloud is a dense towering vertical cloud1 associated with thunderstorms and atmospheric instability forming from water vapor carried by powerful upward air currents if observed during a storm these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads cumulonimbus can form alone in clusters or along cold front squall lines these clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather such as tornadoes cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell cumulonimbus is abbreviated cb  contents  appearanceedit speciesedit cumulonimbus calvus a clearly developed cumulonimbus fibrous-edged top capillatus anvil-topped incus supplementary featuresedit accessory cloudsedit supplementary featuresedit precipitation-based supplementary featuresedit arcus cloud shelf cloud leading a thunderstorm mammatocumulus with drooping pouches a cap pileus atop a calvus a funnel cloud tuba over the netherlands incus with a velum edge cumulonimbus calvus against sunlight with rain falling beneath it as a rain shaft praecipatio rain evaporating before reaching the ground virga picture of a cumulonimbus capillatus cloud over africa displaying an overshooting top taken from the international space station flanking line in front of a strong thunderstorm effectsedit life cycle or stagesedit cloud typesedit clouds form when the dewpoint of water is reached in the presence of condensation nuclei in the troposphere the atmosphere is a dynamic system and the local conditions of turbulence uplift and other parameters give rise to many types of clouds various types of cloud occur frequently enough to have been categorized furthermore some atmospheric processes can make the clouds organize in distinct patterns such as wave clouds or actinoform clouds these are large-scale structures and are not always readily identifiable from a single point of view see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

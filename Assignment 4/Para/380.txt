intergovernmental panel on climate change the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is a scientific and intergovernmental body under the auspices of the united nations12 set up at the request of member governments dedicated to the task of providing the world with an objective scientific view of climate change and its political and economic impacts.3 it was first established in 1988 by two united nations organizations the world meteorological organization wmo and the united nations environment programme unep and later endorsed by the united nations general assembly through resolution 43/53 membership of the ipcc is open to all members of the wmo and unep.4 the ipcc produces reports that support the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which is the main international treaty on climate change.56 the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic i.e. human-induced interference with the climate system.5 ipcc reports cover the scientific technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation.6 the ipcc does not carry out its own original research nor does it do the work of monitoring climate or related phenomena itself the ipcc bases its assessment on the published literature which includes peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources.7 thousands of scientists and other experts contribute on a voluntary basis without payment from the ipcc8 to writing and reviewing reports which are then reviewed by governments ipcc reports contain a summary for policymakers which is subject to line-by-line approval by delegates from all participating governments typically this involves the governments of more than 120 countries.9 the ipcc provides an internationally accepted authority on climate change10 producing reports which have the agreement of leading climate scientists and the consensus of participating governments the 2007 nobel peace prize was shared in equal parts between the ipcc and al gore.11  contents  origins and aimsedit the ipcc developed from an international scientific body the advisory group on greenhouse gases set up in 1985 by the international council of scientific unions the united nations environment programme unep and the world meteorological organization wmo to provide recommendations based on current research this small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover the increasingly complex interdisciplinary nature of climate science the united states environmental protection agency and state department wanted an international convention to agree restrictions on greenhouse gases and the conservative reagan administration was concerned about unrestrained influence from independent scientists or from united nations bodies including unep and the wmo the u.s government was the main force in forming the ipcc as an autonomous intergovernmental body in which scientists took part both as experts on the science and as official representatives of their governments to produce reports which had the firm backing of all the leading scientists worldwide researching the topic and which then had to gain consensus agreement from every one of the participating governments in this way it was formed as a hybrid between a scientific body and an intergovernmental political organisation.3 the principles that the ipcc operates under12 are set out in the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process.13 the aims of the ipcc are to assess scientific information relevant to:6 organizationedit korean economist hoesung lee has been the chair of the ipcc since october 8 2015 following the election of the new ipcc bureau.14 before this election the ipcc was led by his vice-chair ismail el gizouli who was designated acting chair after the resignation of rajendra k pachauri in february 2015.15 the previous chairs were rajendra k pachauri elected in may 2002 robert watson in 1997 and bert bolin in 1988.16 the chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs working group co-chairs and a secretariat the ipcc panel is composed of representatives appointed by governments and organizations participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged plenary sessions of the ipcc and ipcc working groups are held at the level of government representatives non governmental and intergovernmental organizations may be allowed to attend as observers sessions of the ipcc bureau workshops expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only.17 attendance at the 2003 meeting included 350 government officials and climate change experts after the opening ceremonies closed plenary sessions were held.18 the meeting report19 states there were 322 persons in attendance at sessions with about seven-eighths of participants being from governmental organizations.19 there are several major groups the ipcc receives funding through the ipcc trust fund established in 1989 by the united nations environment programme unep and the world meteorological organization wmo costs of the secretary and of housing the secretariat are provided by the wmo while unep meets the cost of the depute secretary annual cash contributions to the trust fund are made by the wmo by unep and by ipcc members the scale of payments is determined by the ipcc panel which is also responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget the organisation is required to comply with the financial regulations and rules of the wmo.23 assessment reportsedit the ipcc has published five comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science24 as well as a number of special reports on particular topics these reports are prepared by teams of relevant researchers selected by the bureau from government nominations drafts of these reports are made available for comment in open review processes to which anyone may contribute.citation needed the ipcc published its first assessment report in 1990 a supplementary report in 1992 a second assessment report sar in 1995 a third assessment report tar in 2001 a fourth assessment report ar4 in 200725 and a fifth assessment report ar5 in 2014 each assessment report is in three volumes corresponding to working groups i ii and iii unqualified the ipcc report is often used to mean the working group i report which covers the basic science of climate change scope and preparation of the reportsedit the ipcc does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data lead authors of ipcc reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources.2627 according to ipcc guidelines authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.26 authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources the grey literature provided that they are of sufficient quality.26 examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations and industry journals.7 each subsequent ipcc report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required there are generally three stages in the review process:28 review comments are in an open archive for at least five years there are several types of endorsement which documents receive the panel is responsible for the ipcc and its endorsement of reports allows it to ensure they meet ipcc standards there have been a range of commentaries on the ipcc's procedures examples of which are discussed later in the article see also ipcc summary for policymakers some of these comments have been supportive29 while others have been critical.30 some commentators have suggested changes to the ipcc's procedures.31 authorsedit each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material a chapter typically has two coordinating lead authors ten to fifteen lead authors and a somewhat larger number of contributing authors the coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements and reporting to the working group chairs lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters contributing authors prepare text graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors authors for the ipcc reports are chosen from a list of researchers prepared by governments and participating organisations and by the working group/task force bureaux as well as other experts known through their published work the choice of authors aims for a range of views expertise and geographical representation ensuring representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition first assessment reportedit the ipcc first assessment report was completed in 1990 and served as the basis of the unfccc supplementary report of 1992edit the 1992 supplementary report was an update requested in the context of the negotiations on the unfccc at the earth summit united nations conference on environment and development in rio de janeiro in 1992 the major conclusion was that research since 1990 did not affect our fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the first ipcc scientific assessment it noted that transient time-dependent simulations which had been very preliminary in the far were now improved but did not include aerosol or ozone changes second assessment reportedit climate change 1995 the ipcc second assessment report sar was finished in 1996 it is split into four parts each of the last three parts was completed by a separate working group and each has a summary for policymakers spm that represents a consensus of national representatives the spm of the wg i report contains headings third assessment reportedit the third assessment report tar was completed in 2001 and consists of four reports three of them from its working groups a number of the tar's conclusions are given quantitative estimates of how probable it is that they are correct e.g. greater than 66 probability of being correct.36 these are bayesian probabilities which are based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence.3738 robust findings of the tar synthesis report include comments on the taredit in 2001 the us national research council us nrc46 produced a report that assessed working group i's wgi contribution to the tar us nrc 200147 generally agrees with the wgi assessment and describes the full wgi report as an admirable summary of research activities in climate science.48 ipcc author richard lindzen has made a number of criticisms of the tar.49 among his criticisms lindzen has stated that the wgi summary for policymakers spm does not faithfully summarize the full wgi report.49 for example lindzen states that the spm understates the uncertainty associated with climate models.49 john houghton who was a co-chair of tar wgi50 has responded to lindzen's criticisms of the spm.51 houghton has stressed that the spm is agreed upon by delegates from many of the world's governments and that any changes to the spm must be supported by scientific evidence.51 ipcc author kevin trenberth has also commented on the wgi spm.52 trenberth has stated that during the drafting of the wgi spm some government delegations attempted to blunt and perhaps obfuscate the messages in the report.52 however trenberth concludes that the spm is a reasonably balanced summary.52 us nrc 200153 concluded that the wgi spm and technical summary are consistent with the full wgi report us nrc 200148 stated ... the full wgi report is adequately summarized in the technical summary the full wgi report and its technical summary are not specifically directed at policy the summary for policymakers reflects less emphasis on communicating the basis for uncertainty and a stronger emphasis on areas of major concern associated with human-induced climate change this change in emphasis appears to be the result of a summary process in which scientists work with policy makers on the document written responses from u.s coordinating and lead scientific authors to the committee indicate however that a no changes were made without the consent of the convening lead authors this group represents a fraction of the lead and contributing authors and b most changes that did occur lacked significant impact fourth assessment reportedit the fourth assessment report ar4 was published in 2007.54 like previous assessment reports it consists of four reports people from over 130 countries contributed to the ipcc fourth assessment report which took 6 years to produce.54 contributors to ar4 included more than 2500 scientific expert reviewers more than 800 contributing authors and more than 450 lead authors.54 robust findings of the synthesis report include:55 likely means greater than 66 probability of being correct based on expert judgement.57 response to ar4edit several science academies have referred to and/or reiterated some of the conclusions of ar4 these include the netherlands environmental assessment agency pbl et al. 2009;68 201069 has carried out two reviews of ar4 these reviews are generally supportive of ar4's conclusions.7071 pbl 201071 make some recommendations to improve the ipcc process a literature assessment by the us national research council us nrc 201072 concludes some errors have been found in the ipcc ar4 working group ii report two errors include the melting of himalayan glaciers see later section and dutch land area that is below sea level.73 fifth assessment reportedit the ipcc's fifth assessment report ar5 was completed in 2014.74 ar5 followed the same general format as of ar4 with three working group reports and a synthesis report.74 the working group i report wg1 was published in september 2013.74 conclusions of ar5 are summarized below representative concentration pathwaysedit projections in ar5 are based on representative concentration pathways rcps.84 the rcps are consistent with a wide range of possible changes in future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions projected changes in global mean surface temperature and sea level are given in the main rcp article special reportsedit in addition to climate assessment reports the ipcc is publishing special reports on specific topics the preparation and approval process for all ipcc special reports follows the same procedures as for ipcc assessment reports in the year 2011 two ipcc special report were finalized the special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation srren and the special report on managing risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex both special reports were requested by governments.85 special report on emissions scenarios sresedit the special report on emissions scenarios sres is a report by the ipcc which was published in 2000.86 the sres contains scenarios of future changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide.87 one of the uses of the sres scenarios is to project future changes in climate e.g. changes in global mean temperature the sres scenarios were used in the ipcc's third88 and fourth assessment reports.89 the sres scenarios are baseline or reference scenarios which means that they do not take into account any current or future measures to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions e.g. the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change.90 sres emissions projections are broadly comparable in range to the baseline projections that have been developed by the scientific community.91 comments on the sresedit there have been a number of comments on the sres parson et al 200792 stated that the sres represented a substantial advance from prior scenarios at the same time there have been criticisms of the sres.93 the most prominently publicized criticism of sres focused on the fact that all but one of the participating models compared gross domestic product gdp across regions using market exchange rates mer instead of the more correct purchasing-power parity ppp approach.94 this criticism is discussed in the main sres article special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation srrenedit this report assesses existing literature on renewable energy commercialisation for the mitigation of climate change it was published in 2012 and covers the six most important renewable energy technologies as well as their integration into present and future energy systems it also takes into consideration the environmental and social consequences associated with these technologies the cost and strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application and diffusion the full report in pdf form is found here http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srren/srren_full_report.pdf more than 130 authors from all over the world contributed to the preparation of ipcc special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation srren on a voluntary basis  not to mention more than 100 scientists who served as contributing authors.8595 special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srexedit the report was published in 2012 it assesses the effect that climate change has on the threat of natural disasters and how nations can better manage an expected change in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of severe weather patterns it aims to become a resource for decision-makers to prepare more effectively for managing the risks of these events a potentially important area for consideration is also the detection of trends in extreme events and the attribution of these trends to human influence the full report 594 pages in pdf form may be found here 1 more than 80 authors 19 review editors and more than 100 contributing authors from all over the world contributed to the preparation of srex.8596 methodology reportsedit within ipcc the national greenhouse gas inventory program develops methodologies to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases.97 this has been undertaken since 1991 by the ipcc wgi in close collaboration with the organisation for economic co-operation and development and the international energy agency the objectives of the national greenhouse gas inventory program are revised 1996 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventoriesedit the 1996 guidelines for national greenhouse gas investories provide the methodological basis for the estimation of national greenhouse gas emissions inventories.98 over time these guidelines have been completed with good practice reports good practice guidance and uncertainty management in national greenhouse gas inventories and good practice guidance for land use land-use change and forestry the 1996 guidelines and the two good practice reports are to be used by parties to the unfccc and to the kyoto protocol in their annual submissions of national greenhouse gas inventories 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventoriesedit the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories is the latest version of these emission estimation methodologies including a large number of default emission factors.clarification needed99 although the ipcc prepared this new version of the guidelines on request of the parties to the unfccc the methods have not yet been officially accepted for use in national greenhouse gas emissions reporting under the unfccc and the kyoto protocol.100 activitiesedit the ipcc concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant wmo executive council and unep governing council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the unfccc process.6 while the preparation of the assessment reports is a major ipcc function it also supports other activities such as the data distribution centre101 and the national greenhouse gas inventories programme102 required under the unfccc this involves publishing default emission factors which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption industrial production and so on the ipcc also often answers inquiries from the unfccc subsidiary body for scientific and technological advice sbsta nobel peace prizeedit in december 2007 the ipcc was awarded the nobel peace prize for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change the award is shared with former u.s vice-president al gore for his work on climate change and the documentary an inconvenient truth.103 criticismsedit there is widespread support for the ipcc in the scientific community which is reflected in publications by other scientific bodies416272 and experts.104 however criticisms of the ipcc have been made.105 since 2010 the ipcc has come under yet unparalleled public and political scrutiny.106 the global ipcc consensus approach has been challenged internally107108 and externally with the 2009 climatic research unit email controversy climategate an important but not sole threshold.109 it has been deemed an information monopoly with results for both the quality and the impact of the ipcc work as such.107110 projected date of melting of himalayan glaciersedit a paragraph in the 2007 working group ii report impacts adaptation and vulnerability chapter 10 included a projection that himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035 this projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers the ipcc has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust they expressed regret for the poor application of well-established ipcc procedures in this instance the date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the ipcc from the wwf report which has misquoted its own source an icsi report variations of snow and ice in the past and at present on a global and regional scale rajendra k pachauri responded in an interview with science.111 overstatement of effectsedit former ipcc chairman robert watson said regarding the himalayan glaciers estimation the mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact that is worrying the ipcc needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened.112 martin parry a climate expert113 who had been co-chair of the ipcc working group ii said that what began with a single unfortunate error over himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance and the ipcc had investigated the other alleged mistakes which were generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment.114 emphasis of the hockey stick graphedit the third assessment report tar prominently featured116 a graph labeled millennial northern hemisphere temperature reconstruction based on a 1999 paper by michael e mann raymond s bradley and malcolm k hughes mbh99 which has been referred to as the hockey stick graph this graph extended the similar graph in figure 3.20 from the ipcc second assessment report of 1995 and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years and higher temperatures during the medieval warm period than the mid 20th century the schematic was not an actual plot of data and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central england with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of medieval vineyards in england even with this increase the maximum it showed for the medieval warm period did not reach temperatures recorded in central england in 2007.115 the mbh99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by jones et al 1998 pollack huang  shen 1998 crowley  lowery 2000 and briffa 2000 using differing data and methods the jones et al and briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the mbh99 reconstruction in figure 2.21 of the ipcc report.117 on 23 june 2005 rep joe barton chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce wrote joint letters with ed whitfield chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations demanding full records on climate research as well as personal information about their finances and careers from mann bradley and hughes.122 sherwood boehlert chairman of the house science committee said this was a misguided and illegitimate investigation apparently aimed at intimidating scientists and at his request the u.s national academy of sciences arranged for its national research council to set up a special investigation.123 the national research council's report agreed that there were some statistical failings but these had little effect on the graph which was generally correct in a 2006 letter to nature mann bradley and hughes pointed out that their original article had said that more widespread high-resolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached and that the uncertainties were the point of the article.124 the ipcc fourth assessment report ar4 published in 2007 featured a graph showing 12 proxy based temperature reconstructions including the three highlighted in the 2001 third assessment report tar mann bradley  hughes 1999 as before jones et al 1998 and briffa 2000 had both been calibrated by newer studies in addition analysis of the medieval warm period cited reconstructions by crowley  lowery 2000 as cited in the tar and osborn  briffa 2006 ten of these 14 reconstructions covered 1000 years or longer most reconstructions shared some data series particularly tree ring data but newer reconstructions used additional data and covered a wider area using a variety of statistical methods the section discussed the divergence problem affecting certain tree ring data.125 conservative nature of ipcc reportsedit some critics have contended that the ipcc reports tend to be conservative by consistently underestimating the pace and impacts of global warming126 and report only the lowest common denominator findings.127 on 1 february 2007 the eve of the publication of ipcc's major report on climate a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last ipcc report in 2001.128 the study compared ipcc 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations over the six years studied the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by ipcc's 2001 projection and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the ipcc projection greg holland from the national center for atmospheric research who reviewed a multi-meter sea level rise study by jim hansen noted there is no doubt that the sea level rise within the ipcc is a very conservative number so the truth lies somewhere between ipcc and jim.131 in reporting criticism by some scientists that ipcc's then-impending january 2007 report understates certain risks particularly sea level rises an ap story quoted stefan rahmstorf professor of physics and oceanography at potsdam university as saying in a way it is one of the strengths of the ipcc to be very conservative and cautious and not overstate any climate change risk.132 in his december 2006 book hell and high water global warming and in an interview on fox news on 31 january 2007 energy expert joseph romm noted that the ipcc fourth assessment report is already out of date and omits recent observations and factors contributing to global warming such as the release of greenhouse gases from thawing tundra.133 political influence on the ipcc has been documented by the release of a memo by exxonmobil to the bush administration and its effects on the ipcc's leadership the memo led to strong bush administration lobbying evidently at the behest of exxonmobil to oust robert watson a climate scientist from the ipcc chairmanship and to have him replaced by pachauri who was seen at the time as more mild-mannered and industry-friendly.134135 ipcc processesedit the ipcc process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges compare ozone depletion and global warming in case of the ozone depletion global regulation based on the montreal protocol has been successful in case of climate change the kyoto protocol failed.139 the ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the ipcc process.140 the lockstep situation of the ipcc is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different if not opposing goals.141 the underlying linear model of policy-making of more knowledge we have the better the political response will be is being doubted.141142 according to sheldon ungar's comparison with global warming the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties.143 the ozone case communicated to lay persons with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture and related to immediate risks with everyday relevance while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger.143 the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts.140 in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem.139 in the uk a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change144 but the stern review ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.145 outdatedness of reportsedit since the ipcc does not carry out its own research it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report's final release in principle this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report cannot be included in an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science.146 however there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next.citation needed the submission deadlines for the fourth assessment report ar4 differed for the reports of each working group deadlines for the working group i report were adjusted during the drafting and review process in order to ensure that reviewers had access to unpublished material being cited by the authors the final deadline for cited publications was 24 july 2006.147 the final wg i report was released on 30 april 2007 and the final ar4 synthesis report was released on 17 november 2007 rajendra pachauri the ipcc chair admitted at the launch of this report that since the ipcc began work on it scientists have recorded much stronger trends in climate change like the unforeseen dramatic melting of polar ice in the summer of 2007148 and added that means you better start with intervention much earlier.149 burden on participating scientistsedit scientists who participate in the ipcc assessment process do so without any compensation other than the normal salaries they receive from their home institutions the process is labor-intensive diverting time and resources from participating scientists research programs.150 concerns have been raised that the large uncompensated time commitment and disruption to their own research may discourage qualified scientists from participating.151 lack of error correction after publicationedit in may 2010 pachauri noted that the ipcc currently had no process for responding to errors or flaws once it issued a report the problem according to pachauri was that once a report was issued the panels of scientists producing the reports were disbanded.152 proposed organizational overhauledit in february 2010 in response to controversies regarding claims in the fourth assessment report153154 five climate scientists  all contributing or lead ipcc report authors  wrote in the journal nature calling for changes to the ipcc they suggested a range of new organizational options from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated living wikipedia-ipcc.155156 other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference.157 interacademy council reviewedit in march 2010 at the invitation of the united nations secretary-general and the chair of the ipcc the interacademy council iac was asked to review the ipcc's processes for developing its reports.158159 the iac panel chaired by harold tafler shapiro convened on 14 may 2010 and released its report on 1 september 2010.152160 the iac found that the ipcc assessment process has been successful overall the panel however made seven formal recommendations for improving the ipcc's assessment process including the panel also advised that the ipcc avoid appearing to advocate specific policies in response to its scientific conclusions.162 commenting on the iac report nature news noted that the proposals were met with a largely favourable response from climate researchers who are eager to move on after the media scandals and credibility challenges that have rocked the united nations body during the past nine months.163 archivingedit papers and electronic files of certain working groups of the ipcc including reviews and comments on drafts of their assessment reports are archived at the environmental science and public policy archives in the harvard

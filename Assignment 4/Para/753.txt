in major manufacturing industrialization and rail transportation baltimore shifted to a service-oriented economy with johns hopkins hospital founded 1889 and johns hopkins university founded 1876 now the city's top two employers.14 with hundreds of identified districts baltimore has been dubbed a city of neighborhoods. famous residents have included writers edgar allan poe edith hamilton frederick

65000 properties are designated historic buildings in the national register of historic places listings in baltimore more than any other u.s city.17 the historical records of the government of baltimore are located at the baltimore city archives etymologyedit before european settlementedit the baltimore area had been inhabited by native americans since at least the 10th millennium bc when paleo-indians first settled in the region one paleo-indian site and several archaic period and woodland period archaeological sites have been identified in baltimore including four from the late woodland period.24 during the late woodland period the archaeological culture that is called the potomac creek complex resided in the area from baltimore to the rappahannock river in virginia.25 in the early 1600s the immediate baltimore vicinity was sparsely populated if at all by native americans the baltimore county area northward was used as hunting grounds by the susquehannocks living in the lower susquehanna river valley who controlled all of the upper tributaries of the chesapeake but refrained from much contact with powhatan in the potomac region.26 pressured by the susquehannocks the piscataway tribe of algonquians stayed well south of the baltimore area and inhabited primarily the north bank of the potomac river in what is now charles county and southern prince george's county south of the fall line.272829 colonial periodedit european colonization of maryland began with the arrival of an english ship at st clement's island in the potomac river europeans began to settle the area further north beginning to populate the area of baltimore county30 with its original county seat known today as old baltimore located on bush river within the present-day aberdeen proving ground.313233 the colonists engaged in sporadic warfare with the susquhanna natives whose numbers dwindled from casualties and smallpox.30 in 1661 david jones claimed the area known today as jonestown on the east bank of the jones falls stream.34 the colonial general assembly of maryland created the port of baltimore at old whetstone point now locust point in 1706 for the tobacco trade the town of baltimore on the west side of the jones falls was founded and laid out on july 30 1729 with jonestown and fells point preexisting to the east the three settlements covering 60 acres became a commercial hub and in 1768 became the county seat.35 baltimore grew swiftly in the 18th century as a granary for sugar-producing colonies in the caribbean the profit from sugar encouraged the cultivation of cane and the importation of food.36 baltimore established its public market system in 1763.37 lexington market founded in 1782 continues to be known as one of the oldest continuously operating public markets in the united states today.38 lexington market was also known to be a place for slave trading which occurred all over the downtown area and was advertised in the baltimore sun.39 baltimore had the first post office system in the united states inaugurated in 177440 and the first water company chartered in the united states baltimore water company 1792.4142 baltimore played a key part in events leading to and including the american revolution city leaders such as jonathan plowman jr moved the city to join the resistance to british taxes and merchants signed agreements to not trade with britain.43 the second continental congress met in the henry fite house from december 1776 to february 1777 effectively making the city the capital of the united states during this period.44 antebellum periodedit baltimore pioneered the use of gas lighting in 1816 and its population grew rapidly in the following decades with concomitant development of culture and infrastructure the construction of the federally funded national road which later became part of u.s route 40 and the private baltimore and ohio railroad b  o. made baltimore a major shipping and manufacturing center by linking the city with major markets in the midwest by 1820 its population had reached 60000 and its economy had shifted from its base in tobacco plantations to sawmilling shipbuilding and textile production these industries benefited from war but successfully shifted into infrastructure development during peacetime.49 baltimore suffered one of the worst riots of the

in the world's first telegraph line between baltimore and washington dc in 1844 civil war and afteredit maryland a slave state with abundant popular support for secession in some areas remained part of the union during the american civil war due in part to the union's strategic occupation of the city in 1861.5253 baltimore saw the first casualties of the war on april 19 1861 when union soldiers en route from the president street station to camden yards clashed with a secessionist mob in the pratt street riot in the midst of the long depression which followed the panic of 1873 the baltimore  ohio railroad company attempted to lower its workers wages leading to strikes and riots in the city and beyond strikers clashed with the national guard leaving 10 dead and 25 wounded.54 20th century through 1968edit the city grew in area by annexing new suburbs from the surrounding counties through 1918 when the city acquired portions of baltimore county and anne arundel county.57 a state constitutional amendment approved in 1948 required a special vote of the citizens in any proposed annexation area effectively preventing any future expansion of the city's boundaries.58 streetcars enabled the development of distant neighborhoods areas such as edmonson village whose residents could easily commute to work downtown.59 driven by migration from the deep south and by white suburbanization the relative size of the city's black population grew from 23.8 in 1950 to 46.4 in 1970.60 encouraged by real estate blockbusting techniques recently settled white areas rapidly became

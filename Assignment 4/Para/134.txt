absolute angular momentum in meteorology absolute angular momentum refers to the angular momentum in an 'absolute coordinate system absolute time and space  contents  introductionedit angular momentum l equates with the cross product of the position vector r of a particle or fluid parcel and its absolute linear momentum p equal to mv the product of mass and velocity mathematically definitionedit absolute angular momentum sums the angular momentum of a particle or fluid parcel in a relative coordinate system and the angular momentum of that relative coordinate system meteorologists typically express the three vector components of velocity v  u v w eastward northward and upward the magnitude of the absolute angular momentum l per unit mass m where the first term represents the angular momentum of the parcel with respect to the surface of the earth which depends strongly on weather the second term represents the angular momentum of the earth itself at a particular latitude essentially constant at least on non-geological timescales applicationsedit where the zonal pressure gradient and eddy stresses cause torque that changes the absolute angular momentum of fluid parcels referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

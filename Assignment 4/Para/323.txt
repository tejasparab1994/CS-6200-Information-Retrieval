central america central america is a part of the mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot which extends from northern guatemala through to central panama due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the central america volcanic arc there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently these natural disasters have resulted in the loss of many lives and much property  contents  different definitionsedit central america may mean different things to various people based upon different contexts historyedit in the pre-columbian era the northern areas of central america were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of mesoamerica most notable among these were the mayans who had built numerous cities throughout the region and the aztecs who had created a vast empire the pre-columbian cultures of eastern el salvador eastern honduras caribbean nicaragua most of costa rica and panama were predominantly speakers of the chibchan languages at the time of european contact and are considered by some11 culturally different and grouped in the isthmo-colombian area in 1538 spain established the real audiencia of panama which had jurisdiction over all land from the strait of magellan to the gulf of fonseca this entity was dissolved in 1543 and most of the territory within central america then fell under the jurisdiction of the audiencia real de guatemala this area included the current territories of costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras nicaragua and the mexican state of chiapas but excluded the lands that would become belize and panama the president of the audiencia which had its seat in antigua guatemala was the governor of the entire area in 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general the captaincy general of guatemala encompassed most of central america with the exception of present-day belize and panama from its independence from spain in 1821 until 1823 the former captaincy general remained intact as part of the short-lived first mexican empire when the emperor of mexico abdicated on 19 march 1823 central america again became independent on 1 july

soconusco the republic lasted from 1823 to 1838 when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.citation needed by the 1930s the united fruit company owned 3.5 million acres of land in central america and the caribbean and was the single largest land owner in guatemala such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries that was one of the factors that led to the coining of

southern north america with unique and varied geographic features the pacific ocean lies to the southwest the caribbean sea lies to the northeast and the gulf of mexico lies to the north some physiographists define the isthmus of tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of central america7 while others use the northwestern borders of belize and guatemala from there the central american land mass extends southeastward to the isthmus of panama where it connects to the pacific lowlands in northwestern south america high points in central america between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee tobacco beans and other crops most of the population of honduras costa rica and guatemala lives in valleys.15 trade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of central america temperatures in central america are highest just prior to the summer wet season and are lowest during the winter dry season when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate the highest temperatures occur in april due to higher levels of sunlight lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.16 biodiversityedit central america is part of the mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot boasting 7 of the world's biodiversity.17 the pacific flyway is a major north-south flyway for migratory birds in the americas extending from alaska to tierra del fuego due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in central america especially in the spring and autumn as a bridge between north america and south america central america has many species from the nearctic and the neotropic ecozones however the southern countries costa rica and panama of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries guatemala and belize meanwhile the central countries honduras nicaragua and el salvador have the least biodiversity.17 the table below shows recent statistics biodiversity in central america number of different species of terrestrial vertebrate animals and vascular plants over 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened 107 of which are classified as critically endangered the underlying problems are deforestation which is estimated by fao at 1.2 per year in central america and mexico combined fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80 of the vegetation in central america has already been converted to agriculture.25 efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves 36 of belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status giving belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the americas in addition 13 of belize's marine territory are also protected.26 a large coral reef extends from mexico to honduras the mesoamerican barrier reef system the belize barrier reef is part of this the belize barrier reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world it is home to 70 hard coral species 36 soft coral species 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species so far only about 10 of the species in the belize barrier reef have been discovered.27 floraedit faunaedit ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna almost half of the bird population of the talamancan montane forests in costa rica and panama are endemic to this region several birds are listed as threatened most notably the resplendent quetzal pharomacrus mocinno three-wattled bellbird procnias tricarunculata bare-necked umbrellabird cephalopterus glabricollis and black guan chamaepetes unicolor many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest the golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the monteverde reserve which is part of the talamancan montane forests has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by iucn the exact causes for its extincition are unknown global warming may have played a role because the development of fog that is typical for this area may have been compromised seven small mammals are endemic to the costa rica-chiriqui highlands within the talamancan montane forest region jaguars cougars spider monkeys as well as tapirs and anteaters live in the woods of central america.30 the central american red brocket is a brocket deer found in central america's tropical forest geologyedit central america is geologically very active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring frequently and tsunamis occurring occasionally many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters the middle america trench is not the only source of seismic activity in central america the motagua fault is an onshore continuation of the cayman trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the north american plate and the caribbean plate this transform fault cuts right across guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the middle america trench along the pacific coast of mexico near acapulco seismic activity at the motagua fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717 1773 1902 1976 1980 and 2009 managua the capital of nicaragua was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972 volcanic eruptions are also common in central america in 1968 the arenal volcano in costa rica erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of tabacon pueblo nuevo and san luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas demographicsedit languagesedit the official language majority in all central american countries is spanish except in belize where the official language is english mayan

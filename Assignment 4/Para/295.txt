portuguese language portuguese is part of the ibero-romance group that evolved from several dialects of vulgar latin in the medieval kingdom of galicia and has kept some celtic phonology and lexicon.78 with approximately 215 to 220 million native speakers and 260 million total speakers portuguese is usually listed as the sixth most natively spoken language in the world the third-most spoken european language in the world in terms of native speakers9 and a major language of the southern hemisphere it is also the most spoken language in south america and the second-most spoken in latin america after spanish and is an official language of the european union mercosul oas ecowas and the african union  contents  historyedit between 409 a.d and 711 a.d. as the roman empire collapsed in western europe the iberian peninsula was conquered by germanic peoples of the migration period the occupiers mainly suebi1011 and visigoths who originally spoke germanic languages quickly adopted late roman culture and the vulgar latin dialects of the peninsula and over the next 300 years totally integrated into the local populations after the moorish invasion beginning in 711 arabic became the administrative and common language in the conquered regions but most of the remaining christian population continued to speak a form of romance commonly known as mozarabic which lasted three centuries longer in spain in the first part of the galician-portuguese period from the 12th to the 14th century the language was increasingly used for documents and other written forms for some time it was the language of preference for lyric poetry in christian hispania much as occitan was the language of the poetry of the troubadours in france portugal became an independent kingdom in 1139 under king afonso i of portugal in 1290 king denis of portugal created the first portuguese university in lisbon the estudos gerais which later moved to coimbra and decreed for portuguese then simply called the common language to be known as the portuguese language and used officially in the second period of old portuguese in the 15th and 16th centuries with the portuguese discoveries the language was taken to many regions of africa asia and the americas by the mid-16th century portuguese had become a lingua franca in asia and africa used not only for colonial administration and trade but also for communication between local officials and europeans of all nationalities geographic distributionedit in some parts of former portuguese india namely goa36 and daman and diu37 the language is still spoken by about 10000 people in 2014 an estimated 1500 students were learning portuguese in goa.38 official statusedit equatorial guinea made a formal application for full membership to the cplp in june 2010 a status given only to states with portuguese as an official language.39 in 2011 portuguese became its third official language besides spanish and french40 and in july 2014 the country was accepted as a member of the cplp.41 portuguese is also one of the official languages of the special administrative region of the people's republic of china of macau alongside chinese and of several international organizations including the mercosur42 the organization of ibero-american states43 the union of south american nations44 the organization of american states45 the african union46 the economic community of west african states46 the southern african development community46 and the european union.47 population of countries and jurisdictions of portuguese official or co-official languageedit according to the world factbook country population estimates for 2017 the population of each of the ten jurisdictions is as follows by descending order this means that the population living in the lusophone official area is around 280000000 inhabitants this number does not include the lusophone diaspora estimated at approximately 10 million people including 4.5 million portuguese 3 million brazilians and half a million cape verdeans among others although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of lusophone territory or are children of immigrants and may have only a basic command of the language it is also important to note that a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the portuguese-speaking countries and territories such as the high number of brazilian and palop emigrant citizens in portugal or the high number of portuguese emigrant citizens in the palop and brazil the portuguese language therefore serves more than 250 million people daily who have direct or indirect legal juridical and social contact with it varying from the only language used in any contact to only education contact with local or international administration commerce and services or the simple sight of road signs public information and advertising in portuguese portuguese as a foreign languageedit portuguese is a mandatory subject in the school curriculum in uruguay49 and argentina.50 other countries where portuguese is taught at schools or is being introduced now include venezuela51 zambia52 the republic of the congo53 senegal53 namibia30 swaziland53 and south africa.53 futureedit according to estimates by unesco portuguese is the fastest-growing european language after english and the language has according to the newspaper the portugal news publishing data given from unesco the highest potential for growth as an international language in southern africa and south america.54 portuguese is a globalized language spoken officially on five continents and as a second language by millions worldwide since 1991 when brazil signed into the economic community of mercosul with other south american nations namely argentina uruguay and paraguay portuguese is either mandatory or taught in the schools of those south american countries although early in the 21st century after macau was ceded to china and brazilian immigration to japan slowed down the use of portuguese was in decline in asia it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there mostly because of increased diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful portuguese-speaking countries brazil angola mozambique etc. in the world.55 dialectsedit audio samples of some dialects and accents of portuguese are available below.59 there are some differences between the areas but these are the best approximations possible ipa transcriptions refer to the names in local pronunciation braziledit portugaledit other countries and dependenciesedit differences between dialects are mostly of accent and vocabulary but between the brazilian dialects and other dialects especially in their most colloquial forms there can also be some grammatical differences the portuguese-based creoles spoken in various parts of africa asia and the americas are independent languages characterization and peculiaritiesedit vocabularyedit most of the lexicon of portuguese is derived directly or through other romance languages from latin nevertheless because of its original celtiberian heritage and later the participation of portugal in the age of discovery it has some gallaecian words and adopted loanwords from all over the world a number of portuguese words can still be traced to the pre-roman inhabitants of portugal which included the gallaeci lusitanians celtici and cynetes most of these words derived from celtic and are very often shared with galician since both languages share a common origin in the medieval language of galician-portuguese a few of these words existed in latin as loanwords from a celtic source often gaulish altogether these are over 1000 words some verbs and toponymic names of towns rivers utensils and plants before the last four decades brazilians adopted a greater number of loanwords from japanese and other european languages due to the historical immigration affecting their demographics and they were and are also more willing to adopt foreign terms that come from globalization than the portuguese while the degree of african tupian and other amerindian lexicon in brazilian portuguese is shown to be surprisingly lesser than that commonly expected of the said variant by the local africanist and indianist academia that also has to some degree influenced the common sense of what gives a different cultural identity of brazilians in relation to the portuguese so that its lexicon is almost identical about 99% to that of european portuguese.848586 many portuguese settlers to colonial brazil were from northern and insular portugal87 apart from some historically important illegal immigrants from elsewhere in europe such as galicia france and the netherlands.88 it should be noted that brazil received more european immigrants in its colonial history than the united states between 1500 and 1760 700000 europeans overwhelmingly portuguese settled in brazil while 530000 europeans settled in the united states for the same given time.89 classification and related languagesedit portuguese belongs to the west iberian branch of the romance languages and it has special ties with the following members of this group portuguese and other romance languages namely french and italian are not mutually intelligible although they share considerable similarities in both vocabulary and grammar portuguese speakers will usually need some formal study before attaining strong comprehension in those romance languages and vice versa however portuguese and galician are mutually intelligible given that portuguese has a larger phonemic inventory than spanish portuguese is only moderately intelligible to some spanish speakers despite the strong lexical and grammatical similarity 89% between the two.90919293 portunhol a form of code-switching has a more lively use and is more readily mentioned in popular culture in south america said code-switching is not to be confused with the portunhol spoken on the borders of brazil with uruguay dialeto do pampa and paraguay dialeto dos brasiguaios and of portugal with spain barranquenho that are portuguese dialects spoken natively by thousands of people which have been heavily influenced by spanish.94 portuguese and spanish are the only ibero-romance languages and perhaps the only romance languages with such thriving inter-language forms in which visible and lively bilingual contact dialects and code-switching have formed in which functional bilingual communication is achieved through attempting an approximation to the target foreign language known as 'portunhol' without a learned acquisition process but nevertheless facilitates communication there is an emerging literature focused on such phenomena including informal attempts of standardization of the linguistic continua and their usage.94 galician-portuguese in spainedit influence on other languagesedit derived languagesedit beginning in the 16th century the extensive contacts between portuguese travelers and settlers african and asian slaves and local populations led to the appearance of many pidgins with varying amounts of portuguese influence as each of these pidgins became the mother tongue of succeeding generations they evolved into fully fledged creole languages which remained in use in many parts of asia africa and south america until the 18th century some portuguese-based or portuguese-influenced creoles are still spoken today by over 3 million people worldwide especially people of partial portuguese ancestry phonologyedit there is a maximum of 9 oral vowels 2 semivowels and 21 consonants though some varieties of the language have fewer phonemes there are also five nasal vowels which some linguists regard as allophones of the oral vowels vowelsedit like catalan and german portuguese uses vowel quality to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables isolated vowels tend to be raised and in some cases centralized when unstressed consonantsedit phonetic notes grammaredit a notable aspect of the grammar of portuguese is the verb morphologically more verbal inflections from classical latin have been preserved by portuguese than by any other major romance language the portuguese and spanish grammars are very close it also has some innovations not found in other romance languages except galician and the fala writing systemedit spelling reformsedit see alsoedit referencesedit literatureedit

lightning lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs during a thunderstorm this discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud called intra-cloud lightning or ic between two clouds cc lightning or between a cloud and the ground cg lightning the charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a flash a lightning flash can also be a strike if it involves an object on the ground lightning creates light in the form of black body radiation from the very hot plasma created by the electron flow and sound in the form of thunder lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash  contents  lightning electrificationedit the differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel soft hail the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged see figure to the left the updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud the larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm.1 the result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.1 the upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals and positive charge in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base this part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil while this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm updrafts and downdrafts in addition there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.1 general considerationsedit many factors affect the frequency distribution strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world these factors include ground elevation latitude prevailing wind currents relative humidity proximity to warm and cold bodies of water etc to a certain degree the ratio between ic cc and cg lightning may also vary by season in middle latitudes because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the earth where lightning can damage or destroy them cg lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types even though ic and cc are more common types of lightning lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation the science of lightning is called fulminology and the fear of lightning is called astraphobia frequencyedit lightning is not distributed evenly around the planet as shown in the map about 70 of lightning occurs over land in the tropics12 where atmospheric convection is the greatest this occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder air masses as well as differences in moisture concentrations and it generally happens at the boundaries between them the flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses such as the gulf stream partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the southeast united states because the influence of small or absent land masses in the vast stretches of the world's oceans limits the differences between these variants in the atmosphere lightning is notably less frequent there than over larger landforms the north and south poles are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning in general cloud-to-ground cg lightning flashes account for only 25 of all total lightning flashes worldwide since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged this is where most cg lightning originates this region is typically at the elevation where freezing occurs within the cloud freezing combined with collisions between ice and water appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process during wind-driven collisions ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge while a heavier slushy mixture of ice and water called graupel develops a negative charge updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive space charge while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge because the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground the proportion of cg strikes versus cloud-to-cloud cc or in-cloud ic discharges becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground in the tropics where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere only 10 of lightning flashes are cg at the latitude of norway around 60 north latitude where the freezing elevation is lower 50 of lightning is cg.1314 necessary conditionsedit in order for an electrostatic discharge to occur two preconditions are necessary firstly a sufficiently high electric potential between two regions of space must exist and secondly a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges it is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood.21 the atmosphere provides the electrical insulation or barrier that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity this is overcome by lightning a complex process referred to as the lightning flash electrical field generationedit as a thundercloud moves over the surface of the earth an equal electric charge but of opposite polarity is induced on the earth's surface underneath the cloud the induced positive surface charge when measured against a fixed point will be small as the thundercloud approaches increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes the referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve the oppositely charged regions create an electric field within the air between them this electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud  the greater the accumulated charge the higher the electrical field flashes and strikesedit the best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground cg although more common intracloud ic and cloud to cloud cc flashes are very difficult to study given there are no physical points to monitor inside the clouds also given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high cg frequency as such knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form cloud to ground lightning leadersedit in a process not well understood a bidirectional channel of ionized air called a leader is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through or are otherwise attracted to regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip the negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region also called a well inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well leaders often split forming branches in a tree-like pattern.22 in addition negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion in a process called stepping the resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes it is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active when this happens the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash in a typical cloud-to-ground flash a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud the weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground the positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions positive upwards within the cloud and negative towards the earth both ionic channels proceed in their respective directions in a number of successive spurts each leader pools ions at the leading tips shooting out one or more new leaders momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions then shooting out another leader the negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward often speeding up as it get closer to the earth's surface initiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood the electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself.24 many hypotheses have been proposed one theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by cosmic rays and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called runaway breakdown as these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules they initiate leader formation another theory invokes locally enhanced electric fields being formed near elongated water droplets or ice crystals.25 percolation theory especially for the case of biased percolation26 clarification needed describes random connectivity phenomena which produce an evolution of connected structures similar to that of lightning strikes upward streamersedit when a stepped leader approaches the ground the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the electric field the electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud such as trees and tall buildings if the electric field is strong enough a positively charged ionic channel called a positive or upward streamer can develop from these points this was first theorized by heinz kasemir.2728 as negatively charged leaders approach increasing the localized electric field strength grounded objects already experiencing corona discharge exceed a threshold and form upward streamers attachmentedit once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader a process referred to as attachment a low-resistance path is formed and discharge may occur photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible the unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning none of which are connected to the earth although it may appear they are dischargeedit return strokeedit once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below there is a large drop in resistance across the lightning channel electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light this is the 'return stroke and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge a large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area this huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground called step potentials they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.citation needed electricity takes every path available to it.29 a portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes the massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs measured in microseconds rapidly superheats the completed leader channel forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel the core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50000 k causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color once the electric current stops flowing the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas the nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively producing a powerful shock wave which is heard as thunder re-strikeedit high-speed videos examined frame-by-frame show that most negative cg lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes though there may be as many as 30.31 each re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time typically 40 to 50 milliseconds as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes re-strikes often cause a noticeable strobe light effect.32 to understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do for reasons not well understood bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network these leaders also called recoil leaders usually decay shortly after their formation when they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network a return stroke-like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader the dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes.33 each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.34 since recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.33 transient currents during flashedit the rapidly changing currents also create electromagnetic pulses emps that radiate outward from the ionic channel this is a characteristic of all electrical discharges the radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases however if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines communication lines or metallic pipes they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination this is the surge that more often than not results in the destruction of delicate electronics electrical appliances or electric motors devices known as surge protectors spd or transient voltage surge suppressors tvss attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current and through an alteration of its physical properties route the spike to an attached earthing ground thereby protecting the equipment from damage typesedit there are three primary types of lightning defined by what is at the ends of a flash channel there are variations of each type such as positive versus negative cg flashes that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured different common names used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events cloud to ground cgedit cloud-to-ground cg lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground it is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud which met by a streamer moving up from the ground cg is the least common but best understood of all types of lightning it is easier to study scientifically because it terminates on a physical object namely the earth and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground of the three primary types of lightning it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or strikes the earth the overall discharge termed a flash is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown stepped leaders connecting leaders return strokes dart leaders and subsequent return strokes.35 positive and negative lightningedit cloud-to-ground cg lightning is either positive or negative as defined by the direction of the conventional electric current from cloud to ground most cg lightning is negative meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel the reverse happens in a positive cg flash where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground positive lightning is less common than negative lightning and on average makes up less than 5 of all lightning strikes.36 there are six different mechanisms theorized to result in the formation of downward positive lightning.37 contrary to popular belief positive lightning flashes do not necessarily originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain-free area outside of the thunderstorm this belief is based on the outdated idea that lightning leaders are unipolar in nature and originating from their respective charge region positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts an average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30000 amperes 30 ka and transfers 15 coulombs of electric charge and 500 megajoules of energy large bolts of negative lightning can carry up to 120 ka and 350 coulombs.38 the average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash and can produce peak currents up to 400000 amperes 400 ka and charges of several hundreds coulombs.3940 furthermore positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes.41 as a result of their greater power as well as lack of warning positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited at the present time aircraft are not designed to withstand such strikes since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set and the dangers unappreciated until the destruction of a glider in 1999.42 the standard in force at the time of the crash advisory circular ac 20-53a was replaced by advisory circular ac 20-53b in 200643 however it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated.4445 aircraft operating in u.s airspace have been required to be equipped with static discharge wicks although their primary function is to mitigate radio interference due to static buildup through friction with the air in the event of a lightning strike a plane is designed to conduct the excess electricity through its skin and structure to the wicks to be safely discharged back into the atmosphere these measures however may be insufficient for positive lightning.46 positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of sprites several tens of kilometers above ground level positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in winter storms as with thundersnow during intense tornadoes47 and in the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm.48 huge quantities of extremely low frequency elf and very low frequency vlf radio waves are also generated.49 a unique form of cloud-to-ground lightning exists where lightning appears to exit from the cumulonimbus cloud and propagate a considerable distance through clear air before veering towards and striking the ground for this reason they are known as bolts from the blue despite the popular misconception that these are positive lightning strikes due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes they begin as intracloud flashes within the cloud the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away.5051  cloud to cloud cc and intra-cloud icedit lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground when it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as inter-cloud lightning and when it occurs between areas of differing electric potential within a single cloud it is known as intra-cloud lightning intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type.48 intra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper anvil portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm this lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called sheet lightning in such instances the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder observational variationsedit         effectsedit lightning strikeedit objects struck by lightning experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude the heat created by lightning currents traveling through a tree may vaporize its sap causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk as lightning travels through sandy soil the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt forming tubular structures called fulgurites even though roughly 90 percent of people struck by lightning survive68 humans or animals struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground by safely conducting a lightning strike to ground a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage lightning also serves an important role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.6970 thunderedit because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel by acoustic echoing from terrain and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike high-energy radiationedit the production of x-rays by a bolt of lightning was theoretically predicted as early as 192571 but no evidence was found until 2001/2002727374 when researchers at the new mexico institute of mining and technology detected x-ray emissions from an induced lightning strike along a grounded wire trailed behind a rocket shot into a storm cloud in the same year university of florida and florida tech researchers used an array of electric field and x-ray detectors at a lightning research facility in north florida to confirm that natural lightning makes x-rays in large quantities during the propagation of stepped leaders the cause of the x-ray emissions is still a matter for research as the temperature of lightning is too low to account for the x-rays observed.7576 a number of observations by space-based telescopes have revealed even higher energy gamma ray emissions the so-called terrestrial gamma-ray flashes tgfs these observations pose a challenge to current theories of lightning especially with the recent discovery of the clear signatures of antimatter produced in lightning.77 recent research has shown that secondary species produced by these tgfs such as electrons positrons neutrons or protons can gain energies of up to several tens of mev.7879 volcanicedit volcanic activity produces lightning-friendly conditions in multiple ways the enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected into the atmosphere creates a dense plume of particles the ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions triboelectrification resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself due to the extensive solid material ash content unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud it is often called a dirty thunderstorm extraterrestrialedit lightning has been observed within the atmospheres of other planets such as jupiter and saturn although in the minority on earth superbolts appear to be common on jupiter human-related phenomenaedit scientific studyedit propertiesedit thunder is heard as a rolling gradually dissipating rumble because the sound from different portions of a long stroke arrives at slightly different times.85 when the local electric field exceeds the dielectric strength of damp air about 3 million volts per meter electrical discharge results in a strike often followed by commensurate discharges branching from the same path see image right. mechanisms that cause the charges to build up to lightning are still a matter of scientific investigation.8687 new study confirming dielectric breakdown is involved rison 2016 lightning may be caused by the circulation of warm moisture-filled air through electric fields.88 ice or water particles then accumulate charge as in a van de graaff generator.89 detection and monitoringedit the earliest detector invented to warn of the approach of a thunder storm was the lightning bell benjamin franklin installed one such device in his house.91 92 the detector was based on an electrostatic device called the 'electric chimes invented by andrew gordon in 1742 lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations including radio-frequency pulses the times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge the united states federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental u.s.9394 in addition to ground-based lightning detection several instruments aboard satellites have been constructed to observe lightning distribution these include the optical transient detector otd aboard the orbview-1 satellite launched on april 3 1995 and the subsequent lightning imaging sensor lis aboard trmm launched on november 28 1997.969798 artificially triggerededit physical manifestationsedit magnetismedit the movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field see electromagnetism the intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field where the lightning current path passes through rock soil or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized this effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism or lirm these currents follow the least resistive path often horizontally near the surface113114 but sometimes vertically where faults ore bodies or ground water offers a less resistive path.115 one theory suggests that lodestones natural magnets encountered in ancient times were created in this manner.116 lightning-induced magnetic anomalies can be mapped in the ground117118 and analysis of magnetized materials can confirm lightning was the source of the magnetization119 and provide an estimate of the peak current of the lightning discharge.120 solar wind and cosmic raysedit some high energy cosmic rays produced by supernovas as well as solar particles from the solar wind enter the atmosphere and electrify the air which may create pathways for lightning bolts.121 in culture and religionedit the expression lightning never strikes twice in the same place is similar to opportunity never knocks twice in the vein of a once in a lifetime opportunity i.e. something that is generally considered improbable lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas since various factors alter the probability of strikes at any given location repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability but are not impossible.123124 similarly a bolt from the blue refers to something totally unexpected some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power such as the people's action party in singapore the british union of fascists during the 1930s and the national states rights party in the united states during the 1950s.125 the schutzstaffel the paramilitary wing of the nazi party used the sig rune in their logo which symbolizes lightning the german word blitzkrieg which means lightning war was a major offensive strategy of the german army during world war ii in french and italian the expression for love at first sight is coup de foudre and colpo di fulmine respectively which literally translated means lightning strike some european languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground as opposed to lightning in general often it is a cognate of the english word rays the name of new zealand's most celebrated thoroughbred horse phar lap derives from the shared zhuang and thai word for lightning.126 the bolt of lightning in heraldry is called a thunderbolt and is shown as a zigzag with non-pointed ends this symbol usually represents power and speed the lightning bolt is used to represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered telegraphs and radios it was a commonly used motif in art deco design especially the zig-zag art deco design of the late 1920s.127 the lightning bolt is a common insignia for military communications units throughout the world a lightning bolt is also the nato symbol for a signal asset the unicode symbol for lightning is  u+2607 see alsoedit referencesedit notesedit bibliographyedit further readingedit external linksedit

naked eye naked eye also called bare eye or unaided eye is the practice of engaging in visual perception unaided by a magnifying or light-collecting optical instrument such as a telescope or microscope vision corrected to normal acuity using corrective lenses is considered naked in astronomy the naked eye may be used to observe events that can be viewed without equipment such as an astronomical conjunction the passage of a comet or a meteor shower sometimes some asteroids can be seen including 4 vesta sky lore and various tests demonstrate an impressive wealth of phenomena that can be seen with the unaided eye  contents  basic accuraciesedit the basic accuracies of the human eye are visual perception allows a person to gain much information about their surroundings naked eye in astronomyedit the visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by light pollution even a few hundred kilometers away from a metropolitan area where the sky can appear to be very dark it is still the residual light pollution that sets the limit on the visibility of faint objects for most people these are likely to be the best observing conditions within their reach under such typical dark sky conditions the naked eye can see stars with an apparent magnitude up to +6m under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent stars as faint as +8m might be visible.4 theoretically in a typical dark sky the dark adapted human eye would see the about 5600 stars brighter than +6m6 while in perfect dark sky conditions about 45000 stars brighter than +8m might be visible.4 in practice the atmospheric extinction and dust reduces this number somewhat in the center of a city where the naked-eye limiting magnitude due to extreme amounts of light pollution can be +4m or less as few as 200 to 500 stars may be visible colors can be seen but this is limited by the fact that the eye uses rods instead of cones to view fainter stars space geodesy and navigationedit the babylonians mayans ancient egyptians ancient indians and chinese measured all the basics of their respective time and calendar systems by naked eye small objects and mapsedit environmental pollutionedit a clean atmosphere is indicated by the fact that the milky way is visible comparing the zenith with the horizon shows how the blue quality is degraded depending on the amount of air pollution and dust the twinkling of a star is an indication of the turbulence of the air this is of importance in meteorology and for the seeing of astronomy light pollution is a significant problem for amateur astronomers but becomes less late at night when many lights are shut off air dust can be seen even far away from a city by its light dome literatureedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

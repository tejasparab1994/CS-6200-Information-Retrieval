three-dimensional space three-dimensional space also 3-space or rarely tri-dimensional space is a geometric setting in which three values called parameters are required to determine the position of an element i.e. point this is the informal meaning of the term dimension  contents  in euclidean geometryedit coordinate systemsedit in mathematics analytic geometry also called cartesian geometry describes every point in three-dimensional space by means of three coordinates three coordinate axes are given each perpendicular to the other two at the origin the point at which they cross they are usually labeled x y and z relative to these axes the position of any point in three-dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of real numbers each number giving the distance of that point from the origin measured along the given axis which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axes.1 other popular methods of describing the location of a point in three-dimensional space include cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates though there are an infinite number of possible methods see euclidean space below are images of the above-mentioned systems cartesian coordinate system cylindrical coordinate system spherical coordinate system lines and planesedit two distinct points always determine a straight line three distinct points are either collinear or determine a unique plane four distinct points can either be collinear coplanar or determine the entire space two distinct lines can either intersect be parallel or be skew two parallel lines or two intersecting lines lie in a unique plane so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common plane two distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel do not meet three distinct planes no pair of which are parallel can either meet in a common line meet in a unique common point or have no point in common in the last case the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallel a line can lie in a given plane intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane in the last case there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given line a hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space the hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the two-dimensional subspaces that is the planes in terms of cartesian coordinates the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single linear equation so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations a line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations each representing a plane having this line as a common intersection spheres and ballsedit a sphere in 3-space also called a 2-sphere because it is a 2-dimensional object consists of the set of all points in 3-space at a fixed distance r from a central point p the solid enclosed by the sphere is called a ball or more precisely a 3-ball the volume of the ball is given by polytopesedit in three dimensions there are nine regular polytopes the five convex platonic solids and the four nonconvex kepler-poinsot polyhedra surfaces of revolutionedit a surface generated by revolving a plane curve about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a surface of revolution the plane curve is called the generatrix of the surface a section of the surface made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular orthogonal to the axis is a circle simple examples occur when the generatrix is a line if the generatrix line intersects the axis line the surface of revolution is a right circular cone with vertex apex the point of intersection however if the generatrix and axis are parallel the surface of revolution is a circular cylinder quadric surfacesedit in analogy with the conic sections the set of points whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree namely where a b c f g h j k l and m are real numbers and not all of a b c f g and h are zero is called a quadric surface.2 there are six types of non-degenerate quadric surfaces both the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are ruled surfaces meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines in fact each has two families of generating lines the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects with just one exception every member of the other family.3 each family is called a regulus in linear algebraedit another way of viewing three-dimensional space is found in linear algebra where the idea of independence is crucial space has three dimensions because the length of a box is independent of its width or breadth in the technical language of linear algebra space is three-dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent vectors dot product angle and lengthedit the dot product of two vectors a  a1 a2 a3 and b  b1 b2 b3 is defined as:4 the magnitude of a vector a is denoted by ||a|| the dot product of a vector a  a1 a2 a3 with itself is which gives the formula for the euclidean length of the vector without reference to the components of the vectors the dot product of two non-zero euclidean vectors a and b is given by5 cross productedit the space and product form an algebra over a field which is neither commutative nor associative but is a lie algebra with the cross product being the lie bracket one can in n dimensions take the product of n  1 vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them but if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and seven dimensions.6 in calculusedit gradient divergence and curledit in a rectangular coordinate system the gradient is given by the divergence of a continuously differentiable vector field f  u i  v j  w k is equal to the scalar-valued function expanded in cartesian coordinates see del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations the curl   f is for f composed of fx fy fz where i j and k are the unit vectors for the x- y- and z-axes respectively this expands as follows:7 line integrals surface integrals and volume integralsedit where r a b  c is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of c andabdisplaystyle a<b where  is the dot product and r a b  c is a bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of c a surface integral is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces it can be thought of as the double integral analog of the line integral to find an explicit formula for the surface integral we need to parameterize the surface of interest s by considering a system of curvilinear coordinates on s like the latitude and longitude on a sphere let such a parameterization be xs t where s t varies in some region t in the plane then the surface integral is given by where the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of xs t and is known as the surface element given a vector field v on s that is a function that assigns to each x in s a vector vx the surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field the result is a vector a volume integral refers to an integral over a 3-dimensional domain it can also mean a triple integral within a region d in r3 of a functionfxyzdisplaystyle fxyz and is usually written as fundamental theorem of line integralsedit the fundamental theorem of line integrals says that a line integral through a gradient field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curve stokes theoremedit divergence theoremedit in topologyedit three-dimensional space has a number of topological properties that distinguish it from spaces of other dimension numbers for example at least three dimensions are required to tie a knot in a piece of string.9 with the spacer3displaystyle scriptstyle mathbb r ^3

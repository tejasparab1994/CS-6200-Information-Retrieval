great plains the great plains sometimes simply the plains is the broad expanse of flat land a plain much of it covered in prairie steppe and grassland that lies west of the mississippi river tallgrass prairie states and east of the rocky mountains in the united states and canada it embraces and reaches into the region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming the canadian portion of the plains is known as the prairies it covers much of alberta and southern saskatchewan and a narrow band of southern manitoba despite covering a relatively small geographic area the prairies are nevertheless home to the majority of each of the three provinces respective populations  contents  usageedit the term great plains is used in the united states to describe a sub-section of the even more vast interior plains physiographic division which covers much of the interior of north america it also has currency as a region of human geography referring to the plains indians or the plains states in canada the term is little used natural resources canada the government department responsible for official mapping and equivalent to the united states geological survey treats the interior plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaux and plains there is no region referred to as the great plains in the atlas of canada.2 in terms of human geography the term prairie is more commonly used in canada and the region is known as the prairie provinces or simply the prairies. the north american environmental atlas produced by the commission for environmental cooperation a nafta agency composed of the geographical agencies of the mexican american and canadian governments uses the great plains as an ecoregion synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography.3 the great plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions temperate prairies west-central semi-arid prairies south-central semi-arid prairies texas louisiana coastal plains and tamaulipus-texas semi-arid plain which overlap or expand upon other great plains designations.4 extentedit the term great plains for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the rocky mountains was not generally used before the early 20th century nevin fenneman's 1916 study physiographic subdivision of the united states5 brought the term great plains into more widespread usage before that the region was almost invariably called the high plains in contrast to the lower prairie plains of the midwestern states.6 today the term high plains is used for a subregion of the great plains geographyedit the great plains are the westernmost portion of the vast north american interior plains which extend east to the appalachian plateau the united states geological survey divides the great plains in the united states into ten physiographic subdivisions paleontologyedit during the cenozoic era specifically about 25 million years ago during the miocene and pliocene epochs the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread the grasslands provided a new niche for mammals including many ungulates and glires that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets traditionally the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked however an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals giving rise to the grit not grass hypothesis.7 climateedit in general the great plains have a wide variety of weather through the year with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers wind speeds are often very high especially in winter grasslands are among the least protected biomes.10 humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures the great plains have dust storms mostly every year or so many thunderstorms occur in the plains in the spring through summer the southeastern portion of the great plains is the most tornado active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as tornado alley floraedit the great plains are part of the floristic north american prairies province which extends from the rocky mountains to the appalachians historyedit original american contactedit the first americans paleo-indians who arrived to the great plains were successive indigenous cultures who are known to have inhabited the great plains for thousands of years over 15000 years ago.1112 humans entered the north american continent in waves of migration mostly over beringia the bering straits land bridge historically the great plains were the range of the bison and of the culture of the plains indians whose tribes included the blackfoot crow sioux cheyenne arapaho comanche and others eastern portions of the great plains were inhabited by tribes who lived in semi-permanent villages of earth lodges such as the arikara mandan pawnee and wichita european contactedit manuel lisa based in st louis established a major fur trading site at his fort lisa on the missouri river in nebraska fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements through the 19th century more european americans and europeans migrated to the great plains as part of a vast westward expansion of population new settlements became dotted across the great plains the new immigrants also brought diseases against which the native americans had no resistance between a half and two-thirds of the plains indians are thought to have died of smallpox by the time of the 1803 louisiana purchase.14 early european settlements on the great plainsedit frenchedit britishedit americanedit pioneer settlementedit after 1870 the new railroads across the plains brought hunters who killed off almost all the bison for their hides the railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to european farmers who rushed to settle the land they and americans as well also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain free farms land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns and those reached by the railroad had a chance while the others became ghost towns in kansas for example nearly 5000 towns were mapped out but by 1970 only 617 were actually operating in the mid-20th century closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether a town would flourish or struggle for business.15 much of the great plains became open range or rangeland where cattle roamed free hosting ranching operations where anyone was theoretically free to run cattle in the spring and fall ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves treated animals and sorted the cattle for sale such ranching began in texas and gradually moved northward between 1866 and 1895 cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as dodge city kansas16 and ogallala nebraska from there cattle were shipped eastward.17 many foreign investors especially british financed the great ranches of the era overstocking of the range and the terrible winter of 1886 resulted in a disaster with many cattle starved and frozen to death theodore roosevelt a rancher in the dakotas lost his entire investment he returned east to reenter politics from then on ranchers generally raised feed to ensure they could keep their cattle alive over winter social lifeedit the railroads opened up the great plains for settlement for now it was possible to ship wheat and other crops at low cost to the urban markets in the east and europe homestead land was free for american settlers railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established immigrants poured in especially from germany and scandinavia on the plains very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves they clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife and numerous children to handle the many chores including child-rearing feeding and clothing the family managing the housework feeding the hired hands and especially after the 1930s handling paperwork and financial details.19 during the early years of settlement farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors after approximately one generation women increasingly left the fields thus redefining their roles within the family new technology including sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles the scientific housekeeping movement promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning advice columns for women regarding farm bookkeeping and home economics courses in the schools.20 although the eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife plains residents created busy social lives for themselves they often sponsored activities that combined work food and entertainment such as barn raisings corn huskings quilting bees21 grange meetings church activities and school functions women organized shared meals and potluck events as well as extended visits between families.22 the grange was a nationwide farmers organization they reserved high offices for women and gave them a voice in public affairs.23 after 19th centuryedit the region roughly centered on the oklahoma panhandle including southeastern colorado southwestern kansas the texas panhandle and extreme northeastern new mexico was known as the dust bowl during the late 1920s and early 1930s the effect of an extended drought inappropriate cultivation and financial crises of the great depression forced many farmers off the land throughout the great plains from the 1950s on many areas of the great plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large landholdings the united states is a major exporter of agricultural products the southern portion of the great plains lies over the ogallala aquifer a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata dating from the last ice age center pivot irrigation is used extensively in drier sections of the great plains resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.24 population declineedit wind poweredit sweetwater was a struggling town typical of the plains steadily losing businesses and population until wind turbines came to surrounding nolan county.29 wind power brought jobs to local residents along with royalty payments to landowners who leased sites for turbines reversing the town's population decline pickens claims the same economic benefits are possible throughout the plains which he refers to as north america's wind corridor. see alsoedit international steppe-landsedit

the quebec  new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project 1100 kilometers south to the boston area phase ii of the james bay project started in 1987 and took nine years to complete construction of the denis-perron dam began in 1994 in 2002 the agreement respecting a new relationship between the cree nation and the government of quebec between the grand council of the crees and the quebec government made possible the development of the eastmain reservoir the 5000 million cad eastmain-1-a and sarcelle powerhouses and rupert river diversion project this will provide water power to new turbines at eastmain-1 or eastmain-1-a and sarcelle powerhouses and will provide increased flow at the existing la grande-1 generating station as well as robert-bourassa or la grande-2-a.17 output will be 918 mw other stations commissioned since 1997 are:18 major outagesedit in 1988 all of quebec and parts of new england and new brunswick lost power because of an equipment failure at a substation on the north shore the march 1989 geomagnetic storm tripped circuit breakers on the transmission network causing a nine-hour quebec-wide blackout corporate structure and financial resultsedit corporate structureedit this functional separation and the creation of a so-called heritage pool french volume patrimonial of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january 2000 report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sector.21  financial resultsedit privatization debateedit activitiesedit power generationedit transmission systemedit interconnectionsedit investmentsedit in addition to the new tie with ontario the company plans to build a new 1200-mw direct current link between the des cantons substation at windsor quebec in quebec's eastern townships and deerfield new hampshire with an hvdc converter terminal built at franklin new hampshire.73 the us segment of the us$1.1 billion line74 would be built by northern pass transmission llc a partnership between northeast utilities 75% and nstar 25%.75 in order to go ahead the project must receive regulatory approval in quebec and the united states the proposed transmission line could be in operation in 2015.76 according to jim robb a senior executive from northeast utilities new england could meet one third of its regional greenhouse gas initiative commitments with the hydropower coming through this new power line alone.77 distributionedit other activitiesedit research and developmentedit research conducted by scientists and engineers at ireq has helped to extend the life of dams improve water turbine performance automate network management and increase the transmission capacity of high voltage power lines.84 in the last 20 years the institute has also conducted research and development work towards the electrification of ground transportation current projects include battery materials including innovative work on lithium iron phosphate and nano-titanate87 improved electric drive trains and the effects of the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles on the power grid.88 projects focus on technologies to increase range improve performance in cold weather and reduce charging time.89 constructionedit the construction of a complex of four hydroelectric generating stations on the romaine river 1550 mw began on may 13 2009.97 the plants are scheduled to be built and commissioned between 2014 and 2020.98 international venturesedit it briefly held a 17 share in senelec senegal's electric utility when the senegalese government decided to sell part of the company to a consortium led by the french company elyo a subsidiary of group suez lyonnaise des eaux in 1999.104 the transaction was canceled in 2000 following the election of president abdoulaye wade.105 environmentedit in addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilities effects on the natural environmentedit in the late 1970s the company set up a network of 27 monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project115 which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first 30 years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by 3 to 6 times over the first 5 to 10 years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after 20 to 30 years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland.114 research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a population's diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spots.114 despite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reduced-flow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expanded.116 social effects and sustainable developmentedit another major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the 20th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the 1950s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreement.116 rates and customersedit quebec marketedit rates are uniform throughout quebec and are based on consumer type and volume of consumption all rates vary in block to mitigate any cross-subsidization effect between residential commercial and industrial customers residential customersedit this preference for electric heating makes electricity demand more unpredictable but offers some environmental benefits despite quebec's very cold climate in winter greenhouse gases emissions in the residential sector accounted for only 5.5 4.65 mt co2 eq. of all emissions in quebec in 2006 emissions from the residential sector in quebec fell by 30 between 1990 and 2006.129 electric meter readings are usually conducted every two months and bills are bimonthly however the company offers an optional equalized payment plan allowing residential customers to pay their annual electricity costs in 12 monthly installments based on past consumption patterns of the current customer address and the average temperature in that location.137 industrial customersedit on may 10 2007 the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the company's merger with rio tinto group renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan has agreed to invest in its quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its corporate headquarters in montreal.146 this argument is disputed by large industrial customers who point out that data from 2000 to 2006 indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase and vice versa we find that the more we export the less lucrative it gets said luc boulanger the head of the association representing quebec's large industrial customers in his opinion the high volatility of electricity markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the quantities of electricity that can be exported when prices are higher.149 export marketsedit the renewable energy law h.781155 was adopted by both houses of the legislature and signed into law by governor jim douglas on june 4 2010.156 a second contract has been signed with

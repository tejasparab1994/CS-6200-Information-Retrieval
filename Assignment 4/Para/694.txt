ontario ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions northern ontario and southern ontario the great majority of ontario's population and arable land is in the south in contrast the larger northern part of ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation  contents  etymologyedit geographyedit the province consists of three main geographical regions the carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province the temperate and fertile great lakes-saint lawrence valley in the south is part of the eastern great lakes lowland forests ecoregion where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture industrial and urban development a well-known geographic feature is niagara falls part of the niagara escarpment the saint lawrence seaway allows navigation to and from the atlantic ocean as far inland as thunder bay in northwestern ontario northern ontario occupies roughly 87 percent of the surface area of the province conversely southern ontario contains 94 percent of the population climateedit the climate of ontario varies by season and location.16 it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairies/us northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean.17 the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief.17 in general most of ontario's climate is classified as humid continental.17 ontario has three main climatic regions historyedit territorial evolutionedit land was not legally subdivided into administrative units until a treaty had been concluded with the aboriginal people ceding the land in 1788 while part of the province of quebec southern ontario was divided into four districts hesse lunenburg mecklenburg and nassau in 1792 the four districts were renamed hesse became the western district lunenburg became the eastern district mecklenburg became the midland district and nassau became the home district counties were created within the districts by 1798 there were eight districts eastern home johnstown london midland newcastle niagara and western by 1826 there were eleven districts bathurst eastern gore home johnstown london midland newcastle niagara ottawa and western by 1838 there were twenty districts bathurst brock colbourne dalhousie eastern gore home huron johnstown london midland newcastle niagara ottawa prince edward simcoe talbot victoria wellington and western in 1849 the districts of southern ontario were abolished by the province of canada and county governments took over certain municipal responsibilities the province of canada also began creating districts in sparsely populated northern ontario with the establishment of algoma district and nipissing district in 1858 the borders of ontario its new name in 1867 were provisionally expanded north and west when the province of canada was formed its borders were not entirely clear and ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the rocky mountains and arctic ocean with canada's acquisition of rupert's land ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing after the federal government asked ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area the province asked for an elaboration on its limits and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel north.30 the northern and western boundaries of ontario were in dispute after canadian confederation ontario's right to northwestern ontario was determined by the judicial committee of the privy council in 1884 and confirmed by the canada ontario boundary act 1889 of the parliament of the united kingdom by 1899 there were seven northern districts algoma manitoulin muskoka nipissing parry sound rainy river and thunder bay four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912 cochrane kenora sudbury and timiskaming.31 european contactedit samuel de champlain reached lake huron in 1615 and french missionaries began to establish posts along the great lakes french settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the iroquois who allied themselves with the british.35 from 1634 to 1640 hurons were devastated by european infectious diseases such as measles and smallpox to which they had no immunity.36 by 1700 the iroquois had seceded from ontario and the mississaugas of the ojibwa had settled the north shore of lake ontario the population of canada west of the st lawrence-ottawa river confluence substantially increased during this period a fact recognized by the constitutional act of 1791 which split quebec into the canadas upper canada southwest of the st lawrence-ottawa river confluence and lower canada east of it john graves simcoe was appointed upper canada's first lieutenant governor in 1793.39 upper canadaedit american troops in the war of 1812 invaded upper canada across the niagara river and the detroit river but were defeated and pushed back by the british canadian fencibles and militias and first nations warriors however eventually the americans gained control of lake erie and lake ontario during the battle of york in 1813 american troops occupied the town of york the americans looted the town and burned the parliament buildings during the brief occupation after the war of 1812 relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from europe rather than from the united states as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed it was a mostly agrarian-based society but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the united states thereby improving previously damaged relations over time meanwhile ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development as the population increased so did the industries and transportation networks which in turn led to further development by the end of the century ontario vied with quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population industry arts and communications.40 unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic family compact who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources and who did not allow elected bodies power this resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early canadian nationalism accordingly rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions louis-joseph papineau led the lower canada rebellion and william lyon mackenzie led the upper canada rebellion canada westedit although both rebellions were put down in short order the british government sent lord durham to investigate the causes of the unrest he recommended that self-government be granted and that lower and upper canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the french canadians accordingly the two colonies were merged into the province of canada by the act of union 1840 with the capital at kingston and upper canada becoming known as canada west parliamentary self-government was granted in 1848 there were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s and the population of canada west more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade as a result for the first time the english-speaking population of canada west surpassed the french-speaking population of canada east tilting the representative balance of power an economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province further increasing the economic strength of central canada with the repeal of the corn laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with united states various industries such as timber mining farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously a political stalemate between the french and english-speaking legislators as well as fear of aggression from the united states during and immediately after the american civil war led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all british north american colonies the british north america act took effect on july 1 1867 establishing the dominion of canada initially with four provinces nova scotia new brunswick quebec and ontario the province of canada was divided into ontario and quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province both quebec and ontario were required by section 93 of the british north america act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of protestant and the catholic minority thus separate catholic schools and school boards were permitted in ontario however neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its french or english-speaking minority toronto was formally established as ontario's provincial capital provincehoodedit once constituted as a province ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power in 1872 the lawyer oliver mowat became premier of ontario and remained as premier until 1896 he fought for provincial rights weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters usually through well-argued appeals to the judicial committee of the privy council his battles with the federal government greatly decentralized canada giving the provinces far more power than john a macdonald had intended he consolidated and expanded ontario's educational and provincial institutions created districts in northern ontario and fought to ensure that those parts of northwestern ontario not historically part of upper canada the vast areas north and west of the lake superior-hudson bay watershed known as the district of keewatin would become part of ontario a victory embodied in the canada ontario boundary act 1889 he also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of canada mowat was the creator of what is often called empire ontario mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast such as sudbury cobalt and timmins the province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled hydro-electric power commission of ontario later ontario hydro the availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry the ford motor company of canada was established in 1904 general motors canada was formed in 1918 the motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the ontario economy during the 20th century in july 1912 the conservative government of sir james whitney issued regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of french-language schooling to the province's french-speaking minority french canadians reacted with outrage journalist henri bourassa denouncing the prussians of ontario the regulation was eventually repealed in 1927 influenced by events in the united states the government of sir william hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the ontario temperance act however residents could distill and retain their own personal supply and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the united states which was under complete prohibition prohibition in ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the liquor control board of ontario under the government of howard ferguson the sale and consumption of liquor wine and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in north america to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld in april 2007 ontario member of provincial parliament kim craitor suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores however the motion was quickly rejected by premier dalton mcguinty the post-world war ii period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to canada largely immigrants from war-torn europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal immigration law a massive influx of non-europeans since the 1970s from a largely ethnically british province ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse ontario's official language is english.5 numerous french language services are available under the french language services act of 1990 in designated areas where sizeable francophone populations exist demographicsedit the percentages given below add to more than 100 percent because of dual responses e.g. french and canadian response generates an entry both in the category french canadian and in the category canadian the majority of ontarians are of english or other european descent including large scottish irish and italian communities slightly less than 5 percent of the population of ontario is franco-ontarian that is those whose native tongue is french although those with french ancestry account for 11 percent of the population in relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration immigration is a huge population growth force in ontario as it has been over the last two centuries more recent sources of immigrants with large or growing communities in ontario include south asians caribbeans latin americans europeans asians and africans most populations have settled in the larger urban centres religionedit in 2011 the largest religious denominations in ontario were the roman catholic church with 31.4 of the population the united church of canada 7.5% and the anglican church 6.1% 23.1 of ontarians had no religious affiliation making it the second-largest religious grouping in the province after roman catholics.43 the major religious groups in ontario in 2011 were languageedit the principal language of ontario is english the province's de facto official language44 which is spoken natively by about 70 of the province's population according to the 2011 census there is also a french-speaking population concentrated in the northeastern eastern and extreme southern parts of the province where under the french language services act provincial government services are required to be available in french if at least 10 of a designated area's population report french as their native language roughly 4 of ontarians speak french as their mother tongue45 and 11 are bilingual speaking both english and french according to the 2011 census.45 other languages spoken by residents include arabic bengali cantonese dutch german greek gujarati hindi italian korean mandarin persian polish portuguese punjabi russian somali spanish tagalog tamil urdu and vietnamese.46 economyedit ontario's rivers make it rich in hydroelectric energy.52 in 2009 ontario power generation generated 70 percent of the electricity of the province of which 51 percent is nuclear 39 is hydroelectric and 10 is fossil-fuel derived.53 by 2025 nuclear power is projected to supply 42% while fossil-fuel-derived generation is projected to decrease slightly over the next 20 years.54 much of the newer power generation coming online in the last few years is natural gas or combined-cycle natural gas plants opg is not however responsible for the transmission of power which is under the control of hydro one despite its diverse range of power options problems related to increasing consumption lack of energy efficiency and aging nuclear reactors ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours quebec and michigan to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods ontario's basic domestic rate in 2010 was 11.17 cents per kwh by contrast quebec's was 6.81.55 in december 2013 the government projected a 42 percent hike by 2018 and 68 percent by 2033.54 industrial rates are projected to rise by 33 by 2018 and 55 in 2033.54 an abundance of natural resources excellent transportation links to the american heartland and the inland great lakes making ocean access possible via container ships have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry of the province found mainly in the golden horseshoe region which is the largest industrialized area in canada the southern end of the region being part of the north american rust belt important products include motor vehicles iron steel food electrical appliances machinery chemicals and paper toronto the capital of ontario is the centre of canada's financial services and banking industry neighbouring cities are home to product distribution it centres and various manufacturing industries canada's federal government is the largest single employer in the national capital region which centres on the border cities of ontario's ottawa and quebec's gatineau.6364 the information technology sector is important particularly in the silicon valley north section of ottawa as well as the waterloo region where the world headquarters of research in

production construction employed more than 6.5 of the province's work force in june 2011.67 tourism contributes heavily to the economy of central ontario peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of fresh water recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres at other times of the year hunting skiing and snowmobiling are popular this region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos among them windsor cornwall sarnia and niagara falls the latter of which attracts millions of us and other international visitors.69 agricultureedit once the dominant industry agriculture occupies a small percentage of the population however much of the land in southern ontario is given over to agriculture as the following table shows while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of a growing population base this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops common types of farms reported in the 2001 census include those for cattle small grains and dairy the fruit and grape-growing industry is primarily on the niagara peninsula and along lake erie where tobacco farms are also situated market vegetables grow in the rich soils of the holland marsh near newmarket the area near windsor is also very fertile the heinz plant in leamington was taken over in these autumn of 2013 by warren buffett and a brazilian partner following which it put 740 people out of work.73 government subsidies followed shortly premier kathleen wynne offered cad$200000 to cushion the blow and promised that another processed-food operator would soon be found.74 on december 10 2013 kellogg's announced layoffs for more than 509 workers at a cereal manufacture plant in london.75 kellogg's plans to relocate jobs to thailand.75 the area defined as the corn belt covers much of the southwestern area of the province extending as far north as close to goderich but corn and soy are grown throughout the southern portion of the province apple orchards are a common sight along the southern shore of nottawasaga bay part of georgian bay near collingwood and along the northern shore of lake ontario near cobourg tobacco production centred in norfolk county has decreased allowing an increase in alternative crops such as hazelnuts and ginseng the ontario origins of massey ferguson once one of the largest farm-implement manufacturers in the world indicate the importance agriculture oncecitation needed had to the canadian economy energyedit the green energy and green economy act 2009 gea takes a two-pronged approach to commercializing renewable energy the bill envisaged appointing a renewable energy facilitator to provide one-window assistance and support to project developers to facilitate project approvals.76 the approvals process for transmission projects would also be streamlined and for the first time in ontario the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects homeowners would have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low or no-interest loans to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels.76 ontario is home to niagara falls which supplies a large amount of electricity to the province the bruce nuclear generating station the largest nuclear power plant in the world is also in ontario and uses 8 candu reactors to generate electricity for the province government law and politicsedit the british north america act 1867 section 69 stipulated there shall be a legislature for ontario consisting of the lieutenant governor and of one house styled the legislative assembly of ontario. the assembly has 107 seats representing ridings elected in a first-past-the-post system across the province the legislative buildings at queen's park are the seat of government following the

religious universities82 and over 500 private career colleges.83 the canadian constitution provides each province with the responsibility for higher education and there is no corresponding national federal ministry of higher education.84 within canadian federalism the division of responsibilities and taxing powers between the ontario and canadian governments creates the need for co-operation to fund and deliver higher education to students each higher education system aims to improve participation access and mobility for students there are two central organizations that assist with the process of applying to ontario universities and colleges the ontario universities application centre and ontario college application service while application services are centralized admission and

lacrosse rugby and soccer transportationedit transportation routes in ontario evolved from early waterway travel and first nations paths followed by european explorers ontario has two major east-west routes both starting from montreal in the neighbouring province of quebec the northerly route which was a major fur trade route travels west from montreal along the ottawa river then continues northwestward towards manitoba major cities on or near the route include ottawa north bay sudbury sault ste marie and thunder bay the southerly route which was driven by growth in settlements originated by the united empire loyalists and later other european immigrants travels southwest from montreal along the st lawrence river lake ontario and lake erie before entering the united states in michigan major cities on or near the route include kingston belleville peterborough oshawa toronto mississauga kitchener-waterloo hamilton london sarnia and windsor this route was also heavily used by immigrants to the midwestern us particularly in the late 19th century roadsedit waterwaysedit the saint lawrence seaway which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the atlantic ocean is the primary water transportation route for cargo particularly iron ore and grain in the past the great lakes and st lawrence river were also a major passenger transportation route but over the past half century passenger travel has been reduced to ferry services and sightseeing cruises railwaysedit freight rail is dominated by the founding cross-country canadian national railway and cp rail companies which during the 1990s sold many short rail lines from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south regional commuter rail is

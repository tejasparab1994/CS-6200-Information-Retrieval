in a single town between 2000 and 5000 people were killed overnight after a massive flood inundated the area fifi brought continuous rainfall to the area for three days hampering relief efforts in what was the worst disaster in honduras history at the time in nearby guatemala an additional 200 people were killed by severe flooding making fifi the worst hurricane to impact the country in nearly 20 years following the catastrophic damage wrought by the storm relief agencies from around the world flew in emergency supplies to assist the hundreds of thousands of homeless people countries closer to honduras such as the united states set up city donation centers that would send supplies to the country in efforts to prevent the spread of post-storm diseases the government allowed the burning of bodies as they were recovered in a single day up to 6000 bodies were burned due to the extreme damage and loss of life the name was retired from the list of atlantic hurricane names and has not been used since  contents  meteorological historyedit impactedit greater antillesedit hondurasedit although by this time the storm was situated inland over mexico its circulation continued to produce thunderstorms over honduras hindering rescue efforts nighttime rescues were prevented by dense fog blanketing most of the mountain valleys.4 the city of la ceiba population 53000 was completely isolated from surrounding areas many were feared dead as newspapers reported bodies floating down rivers.17 the death toll rose by the hundreds every day at one point the official death toll was estimated as high as 10000.20 there is still uncertainty in the total number of fatalities due to fifi in general however most estimates range from 8000 to 10000 overall this ranked fifi as the third-deadliest atlantic hurricane on record at the time.21 it was eventually lowered to fourth after hurricane mitch in 1998 wrought similar destruction in the same region leaving between 11000 and 18000 dead.22 elsewhere in central americaedit mexico and arizonaedit aftermathedit following the severe damage and unprecedented loss of life caused by hurricane fifi its name was retired at the end of the 1974 season as such the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the atlantic hurricane basin however fifi was not replaced by any particular name due to a change in the atlantic hurricane naming scheme in 1979.39 at the time fifi was the first category 2 hurricane to have its name retired since then three other storms of this intensity hurricanes diana juan and tomas in 1990 2003 and 2010 respectively were retired.39 response and assistanceedit four helicopters supplied by the united states from the panama canal quickly began rescue missions they airlifted survivors from flood waters and placed them on elevated land areas the crew members reported that the people were desperate to get on the helicopters and during one mission 34 people crowded on to one of the aircraft which has a normal capacity of 15 food packages dropped to survivors were fought over some people reportedly fighting each other with machetes for the supplies.40 during several of the later rescue missions people died from starvation and malnutrition on board the helicopters.41 from nearby belize britain deployed 57 soldiers with motorboats to rush food to survivors in flooded regions a group of 41 cuban medical experts including 21 doctors treated nearly 900 in a period of two days.42 in honduras the red cross and other relief agencies quickly attempted to unload planes to assure that supplies would reach victims however some of the supplies were hoarded by the honduran military as they quickly went to unload the planes one of the incidents took place after a plane carrying supplies from argentina landed and the military forced the volunteer members away from the plane once in the hands of the military the fate of the supplies was unknown.53 as the full amount of supplies did not reach victims reports of people starving to death surfaced eventually relief crews found these reports to be true as they distributed food to those who survived.54 rebuildingedit in 1977 a large-scale reconstruction project involving six villages across honduras began the first of the six project areas contained 121 homes with an average of 25 square meters of space it was located along an important highway in northern honduras however the rebuilding was initially delayed by erosion issues the second plan consisted of 127 homes roughly a mile south of the first the third consisting of 26 concrete homes was placed in the city of el progreso this project was determined to house the most people per home roughly seven occupants for a preliminary total of 182 people the fourth was the most isolated of the six planned constructions in a rural area far outside urban regions 92 homes were planned to be constructed the fifth project consisting of 33 homes was placed close to the first project having a similar access to the major highway the final housing project and largest was set up south of the destroyed town of choloma a total of 600 homes all built on concrete blocks and doubled up were placed in this housing project.56 see alsoedit referencesedit further readingedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more

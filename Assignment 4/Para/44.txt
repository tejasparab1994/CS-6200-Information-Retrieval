european windstorm european windstorm is a name given to the strongest extratropical cyclones which occur across the continent of europe.2 they form as cyclonic windstorms associated with areas of low atmospheric pressure they are most common in the autumn and winter months on average the month when most windstorms form is january the seasonal average is 4.6 windstorms.3 deep low pressure areas are relatively common over the north atlantic sometimes starting as nor'easters off the new england coast and frequently track across the north atlantic ocean towards western europe past the north coast of britain and ireland and into the norwegian sea however when they track further south they can affect almost any country in europe commonly affected countries include the united kingdom ireland the netherlands norway the faroe islands and iceland but any country in central europe northern europe and especially western europe is occasionally struck by such a storm system the strong wind phenomena intrinsic to european windstorms that give rise to damage footprints at the surface can be placed into three categories namely the warm jet the cold jet and the sting jet these phenomena vary in terms of physical mechanisms atmospheric structure spatial extent duration severity level predictability and location relative to cyclone and fronts.1  contents  nomenclatureedit naming of individual stormsedit up to the second half of the 19th century european windstorms were named after the person who spotted them.citation needed usually they would be named either by the year the date the saint's day of their occurrence5 or any other way that made them commonly known however a storm may still be named differently in different countries for instance the norwegian weather service also names independently notable storms that affect norway6 which can result in multiple names being used in different countries they affect such as an alternative scottish naming system arose in 2011 via social media/twitter which resulted in the humorous naming of hurricane bawbag789 and hurricane fannybaws such usage of the term hurricane is not without precedent as the 1968 scotland storm was referred to as hurricane low q.10 uk and irelandedit germanyedit during 1954 karla wege a student at the free university of berlin's meteorological institute suggested that names should be assigned to all areas of low and high pressure that influenced the weather of central europe.16 the university subsequently started to name every area of high or low pressure within its weather forecasts from a list of 260 male and 260 female names submitted by its students.1617 the female names were assigned to areas of low pressure while male names were assigned to areas of high pressure.1617 the names were subsequently exclusively used by berlin's media until february 1990 after which the german media started to commonly use the names however they were not officially approved by the german meteorological service deutscher wetterdienst.1618 the dwd subsequently banned the usage of the names by their offices during july 1991 after complaints had poured in about the naming system.17 however the order was leaked to the german press agency deutsche presse-agentur who ran it as its lead weather story.17 germany's zdf television channel subsequently ran a phone in poll on 17 july 1991 and claimed that 72 of the 40000 responses favored keeping the names.17 this made the dwd pause and think about the naming system and these days the dwd accept the naming system and request that it is maintained.1718 during 1998 a debate started about if it was discrimination to name areas of high pressure with male names and the areas of low pressure with female names.16 the issue was subsequently resolved by alternating male and female names each year.16 in november 2002 the adopt-a-vortex scheme began which allows members of the public or companies to buy naming rights for a letter chosen by the buyer that are then assigned alphabetically to high and low pressure areas in europe during each year.19 the naming comes with the slim chance that the system will be notable the money raised by this is used by the meteorology department to maintain weather observations at the free university.4 name of phenomenaedit globally storms of this type forming between 30 and 60 latitude are known as extratropical cyclones the name european windstorm reflects that these storms in europe are primarily notable for their strong winds and associated damage which can span several nations on the continent the strongest cyclones are called windstorms within academia and the insurance industry.2 the name european windstorm has not been adopted by the uk met office in broadcasts though it is used in their academic research23 the media or by the general public and appears to have gained currency in academic and insurance circles as a linguistic and terminologically neutral name for the phenomena cyclogenesisedit north atlantic oscillationedit the state of the north atlantic oscillation relates strongly to the frequency intensity and tracks of european windstorms.27 an enhanced number of storms have been noted over the north atlantic/european region during positive nao phases compared to negative nao phases and is due to larger areas of suitable growth conditions the occurrence of extreme north atlantic cyclones is aligned with the nao state during the cyclones development phase.28 the strongest storms are embedded within and form in large scale atmospheric flow.29 it should be kept in mind that on the other hand the cyclones themselves play a major role in steering the nao phase.28 aggregate european windstorm losses show a strong dependence on nao30 with losses increasing/decreasing 10-15 at all return periods.30 clusteringedit temporal clustering of windstorm events has also been noted with 8 consecutive storms hitting europe during the winter of 1989/90 lothar and martin in 1999 were separated only by 36 hours kyrill in 2007 following only four days after hanno and 2008 with johanna kirsten and emma.3132 in 2011 xaver berit moved across northern europe and just a day later another storm named yoda hit the same area in december the same year friedhelm hergen joachim and oliver/patrick cato/dagmar struck northern europe economic impactedit insurance lossesedit insurance losses from windstorms are the second greatest source of loss for any natural peril after atlantic hurricanes in the united states.33 windstorm losses exceed those caused by flooding in europe for instance one windstorm kyrill in 2007 exceeded the losses of the 2007 united kingdom floods.34 on average some 200000 buildings are damaged by high winds in the uk every year.35 energy suppliesedit during the boxing day storm of 1998 the reactors at hunterston b nuclear power station were shut down when power was lost possibly due to arcing at pylons caused by salt spray from the sea.38 when the grid connection was restored the generators that had powered the station during the blackout were shut down and left on manual start so when the power failed again the station was powered by batteries for a short time of around 30 minutes until the diesel generators were started manually.38 during this period the reactors were left without forced cooling in a similar fashion to the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster but the event at hunterston was rated as international nuclear event scale 2.3839 a year later in 1999 during the lothar storm flooding at the blayais nuclear power plant resulted in a level 2 event on the international nuclear event scale.40 cyclone lothar and martin in 1999 left 3.4 million customers in france without electricity and forced edf to acquire all the available portable power generators in europe with some even being brought in from canada.37 these storms brought a fourth of france's high-tension transmission lines down and 300 high-voltage transmission pylons were toppled it was one of the greatest energy disruptions ever experienced by a modern developed country.41 following the great storm of 1987 the high voltage cross-channel link between the uk and france was interrupted and the storm caused a domino-effect of power outages throughout the southeast of england.42 conversely windstorms can produce too much wind power cyclone xynthia hit europe in 2010 generating 19000 megawatts of electricity from germany's 21000 wind turbines the electricity produced was too much for consumers to use and prices on the european energy exchange in leipzig plummeted which resulted in the grid operators having to pay over 18 euros per megawatt-hour to offload it costing around half a million euros in total.43 disruption of the gas supply during cyclone dagmar in 2011 left royal dutch shell's ormen lange gas processing plant in norway inoperable after its electricity was cut off by the storm this left gas supplies in the united kingdom vulnerable as this facility can supply up to 20 percent of the united kingdom's needs via the langeled pipeline fortunately the disruption came at a time of low demand.44 the same storm also saw the leningrad nuclear power plant also affected as algae and mud stirred up by the storm were sucked into the cooling system resulting in one of the generators being shut down.4546 a similar situation was reported in the wake of storm angus in 2016 though not linked specifically to the storm when reactor 1 at torness nuclear power station in scotland was taken offline after a sea water intake tripped due to excess seaweed around the inlet.47 also following storm angus the uk's national grid launched an investigation into whether a ship's anchor damaged four of the eight cables of the cross channel high voltage interconnector which would leave it only able to operate at half of its capacity until february 2017.48 notable windstormsedit historic

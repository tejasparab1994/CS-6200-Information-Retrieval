cyclones formed in the north pacific ocean east of the dateline with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes a total of 10 hurricanes occurred including five major hurricanes  contents  season summaryedit this season marked the end of the northeastern pacific's most recent active period which began in 19829 and includes the five most active pacific hurricane seasons.19 beginning in 1995 multi-decadal factors switched to a phase that suppresses pacific hurricane activity.10 since then pacific hurricane seasons have generally been below normal;11 the lone abnormally active season since then was in 1997 where a strong el nino event was observed.9 the season began with the formation of tropical depression one-e on june 18 and ended with the dissipation of tropical depression nona on october 26.1 no named systems formed in may three in june four in july five in august six in september two in october and none in november.1 the total length of the season from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last was 130 days.13 systemsedit tropical storm alettaedit tropical depression one-e formed from an area of disturbed weather on june 18 it strengthened to tropical storm aletta the next day it continued intensifying and reached its peak intensity on june 20 vertical wind shear began to weaken the storm thereafter the weakening trend continued weakening aletta to a depression on june 21 the system dissipated june 23 aletta's remnant low however could be tracked on satellite images for days following the storm the low finally dissipated north of hawaii.14 aletta never affected land and no damage or casualties were reported.15 tropical storm budedit hurricane carlottaedit tropical storm danieledit hurricane emiliaedit tropical storm fabioedit a tropical depression formed on july 19 later that day it strengthened into tropical storm fabio fabio headed generally west or northwestward.24 it entered the central pacific as a tropical depression and dissipated on july 24.8 hurricane gilmaedit hurricane gilma was the second most-intense pacific at the time as of 2016 it remains the ninth-most intense gilma is also the strongest july storm in the eastern or central pacific.1 hurricane liedit hurricane li is one of only seven tropical cyclones to exist on all three tropical cyclone basins in the pacific ocean it is also one of only six systems to form as a depression in the east pacific but be named in the central the others are lala iniki lana ela and ulika.1 tropical storm hectoredit on august 7 a tropical depression formed from a tropical wave a few hundred miles south of baja california it became tropical storm hector quickly and as it paralleled the coast of mexico it began to weaken dissipating on august 10 no damage was reported anywhere.36 tropical depression one-cedit hurricane ileanaedit hurricane johnedit hurricane john was the longest lasting and farthest traveling tropical cyclone on earth in recorded history.12 it is also one of six tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the pacific ocean an uncommon west-to-east dateline crosser and one of the few tropical cyclone to cross the dateline more than once.1 tropical depression twelve-eedit on august 14 an area of convection organized enough to be considered a tropical depression it was steered by john's circulation and it was never expected to strengthen much because it was close to cool waters.47 the cyclone drifted north then northeast north again northwest and then west.48 the national hurricane center declared the depression dissipated on august 15.49 the depression had no effects anywhere.48 hurricane kristyedit as it approached the hawaiian islands a high surf advisory and a high wind warning were issued for the big island of hawaii no damage or deaths were reported in association with this system.51 its remnants crossed 180th meridian very early on september 7 and was absorbed by a tropical depression which became typhoon melissa in the western pacific basin hurricane laneedit tropical storm meleedit a tropical disturbance became tropical depression two-c on september 6 it reached tropical storm strength the next day being named mele.8 the name mele means song in the hawaiian language and is also the hawaiian form of mary.53 mele headed west-northwest and weakened back into a tropical depression on september it dissipated later that day without incident.8 tropical storm miriamedit tropical storm normanedit a tropical depression formed on september 19 and became tropical storm norman the next day after tracking northwest it began to turn north in response to a trough and convection began to diminish norman dissipated on september 22 without having ever affected land.55 hurricane oliviaedit tropical storm pauledit a nearly stationary cluster of thunderstorms and convection that had been hanging around since september 15 and escaped destruction by tropical storm miriam organized into tropical depression eighteen-e on september 24 it was located between miriam's remnants and the developing olivia it became tropical storm paul on the afternoon of september 25 it peaked in intensity on september 27 then upper outflow from the nearby olivia started shearing the tropical cyclone paul had been completely destroyed by september 30.58 the tropical cyclone never threatened land and consequently no damage or deaths were reported.59 hurricane rosaedit tropical storm nonaedit other stormsedit tropical depression yuriedit storm namesedit the following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeastern pacific ocean during 1994 names that were not assigned this season are marked in gray no names were retired so this same list was used again in the 2000 season this is the same list used for the 1988 season except for ileana which replaced iva and was used for the first time in 1994 for storms that form in the central pacific hurricane center's area of responsibility encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the international date line all names are used in a series of four rotating lists the next four names that were slated for use in 1994 are shown below three of them li mele and nona were used throughout the course of the year season effectsedit this is a table of all the storms that have formed

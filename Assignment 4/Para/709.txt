amtrak the name amtrak is a portmanteau of the words america and trak the latter itself a sensational spelling of track.5 contents historyedit private passenger serviceedit in 1916 98 of all commercial intercity travelers in the united states moved by rail and the remaining 2 moved by inland waterways.6 nearly 42 billion passengers used railways as primary transportation.7 passenger trains were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains.8 thereafter patronage declined in the face of competition from buses air travel and the automobile new streamlined diesel-powered trains such as the pioneer zephyr were popular with the traveling public but could not reverse the trend.9 by 1940 railroads held just 67 percent of commercial passenger-miles in the united states in real terms passenger-miles had fallen by 40 since 1916 from 42 billion to 25 billion.7 traffic surged during world war ii which was aided by troop movement and gasoline rationing the railroad's market share surged to 74 in 1945 with a massive 94 billion passenger-miles.10 after the war railroads rejuvenated their overworked and neglected passenger fleets with fast and luxurious streamliners.11 these new trains brought only temporary relief to the overall decline.12 even as postwar travel exploded passenger travel percentages of the overall market share fell to 46 by 1950 and then 32 by 1957.7 the railroads had lost money on passenger service since the great depression but deficits reached $723 million in 1957 for many railroads these losses threatened financial viability.13 formationedit as passenger service declined various proposals were brought forward to rescue it the 1961 doyle report proposed that the private railroads pool their services into a single body.21 similar proposals were made in 1965 and 1968 but failed to attract support the federal government passed the high speed ground transportation act of 1965 to fund pilot programs in the northeast corridor but this did nothing to address passenger deficits in late 1969 multiple proposals emerged in congress including equipment subsidies route subsidies and lastly a quasi-public corporation to take over the operation of intercity passenger trains matters were brought to a head on march 5 1970 when the penn central the largest railroad in the northeast united states and teetering on bankruptcy filed to discontinue 34 of its passenger trains.22 in october 1970 congress passed and president richard nixon signed into law the rail passenger service act proponents of the bill led by the national association of railroad passengers narp sought government funding to ensure the continuation of passenger trains they conceived the national railroad passenger corporation nrpc a private entity that would receive taxpayer funding and assume operation of intercity passenger trains.23 the original working brand name for nrpc was railpax but shortly before the company started operating it was changed to amtrak.24 there were several key provisions:25 of the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970 only six declined to join amtrak.26 nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived the nixon administration and many washington insiders viewed the nrpc as a politically expedient way for the president and congress to give passenger trains a last hurrah as demanded by the public they expected amtrak to quietly disappear as public interest waned.27 after fortune magazine exposed the manufactured mismanagement in 1974 louis w menk chairman of the burlington northern railroad remarked that the story was undermining the scheme to dismantle amtrak.28 proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief but their view was that amtrak would soon support itself neither view has proved correct popular support has allowed amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined while financial results have made a return to private operation infeasible.citation needed 1970s the rainbow eraedit amtrak began operations on may 1 1971.29 amtrak received no rail tracks or rights-of-way at its inception all amtrak's routes were continuations of prior service although amtrak pruned about half the passenger rail network of the 364 trains operated previously amtrak only continued 182 on trains that continued to the extent possible schedules were retained with only minor changes from the official guide of the railways and under the same names.citation needed several major corridors became freight-only including the ex-new york central railroad's water level route across new york and ohio and grand trunk western railroad's chicago to detroit route reduced passenger train schedules created headaches a 19-hour layover became necessary for eastbound travel on the james whitcomb riley between chicago and newport news.citation needed amtrak's early years are often called the rainbow era which refers to the ad hoc arrangement of the rolling stock and locomotives from a pool of equipment acquired by amtrak at its formation that consisted of a large mix of paint schemes from their former owners this rolling stock which for the most part still bore the pre-amtrak colors and logos formed the multi-colored consists of early amtrak trains by mid-1971 amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased including 286 second-hand locomotives of the emd e and f types 30 gg1 electric locomotives and 1290 passenger cars and continued leasing even more motive power by 1975 the official amtrak color scheme was painted on most amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and rolling stock began appearing.30 amtrak soon had the opportunity to acquire rights-of-way following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s including penn central which owned and operated the northeast corridor nec congress passed the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of 1976.31 a large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of conrail but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the nec not already owned by state authorities to amtrak amtrak acquired the majority of the nec on april 1 1976.32 the portion in massachusetts is owned by the commonwealth and managed by amtrak the route from new haven to new rochelle is owned by the metropolitan transportation authority and the connecticut department of transportation as the new haven line.citation needed this main line became amtrak's jewel asset and helped the railroad generate revenue while the nec ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming as a result amtrak's federal subsidy was increased dramatically in subsequent years other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to amtrak.citation needed the 1980s and 1990sedit building on mechanical developments in the 1970s high speed washington-new york metroliner service was improved with new equipment and faster schedules travel time between new york and washington d.c was reduced to under 3 hours.38 according to the 1980 amtrak annual report a converted 12-car set saved the company approximately $250000 a year in fuel maintenance and yard support costs amtrak completed the head-end power conversion program in 1982 demand for passenger rail service resulted in the creation of five new state-supported routes in california illinois missouri oregon and pennsylvania for a total of 15 state-supported routes across the nation george warrington became president in 1998 with a mandate to make amtrak financially self-sufficient passengers became guests and there were expansions into express freight work but the financial plans failed amtrak's inroads in express freight delivery created additional friction with competing freight operators including the trucking industry delivery was delayed of much anticipated high-speed trainsets for the improved acela express service which promised to be a strong source of income and favorable publicity along the northeast corridor between boston and washington d.c.citation needed growth in the 21st centuryedit ridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the nec and rises in automobile fuel costs the inauguration of the high-speed acela express in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains however through the late 1990s and very early 21st century amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even by 2002 it was clear that amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency but congress continued to authorize funding and released amtrak from the requirement.42 in early 2002 david l gunn replaced warrington as president in a departure from his predecessors promises to make amtrak self-sufficient in the short term gunn argued that no form of passenger transportation in the united states is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured.43 highways airports and air traffic control all require large government expenditures to build and operate coming from the highway trust fund and aviation trust fund paid for by user fees highway fuel and road taxes and in the case of the general fund from general taxation.44 gunn dropped most freight express business and worked to eliminate deferred maintenance.45 from may 2011 to may 2012 amtrak celebrated its 40th anniversary with festivities across the country that started on national train day may 7 2011 a commemorative book entitled amtrak an american story was published and a documentary was created four commemorative heritage units a 40th anniversary exhibit train toured the country the exhibit train visited 45 communities and welcomed more than 85000 visitors.54 it was an entirely rebuilt train powered by ge genesis locomotives and included three refurbished ex-santa fe baggage cars and a food service car four genesis locomotives were painted into retired amtrak paint schemes no 156 was in phase 1 colors no 66 was in phase 2 colors no 145 and no 822 were in phase 3 colors 822 pulled the exhibit train55 and no 184 was in phase 4 colors.5657 in 2014 amtrak began offering a residency program for writers.58 on december 9 2015 boardman announced in a letter to employees that he would be leaving amtrak in september 2016 he had advised the amtrak board of directors of his decision the previous week on august 19 2016 the amtrak board of directors named former norfolk southern railway president  ceo charles wick moorman as boardman's successor with an effective date of september 1 2016.59 during his term moorman took no salary60 and said that he saw his role as one of a transitional ceo who would reorganize amtrak before turning it over to new leadership.61 in may and june 2017 following several service disruptions within pennsylvania station and the east river tunnels the train service announced an expedited schedule for maintenance and repairs of infrastructure which involves the complete shutdown of multiple tracks at a time.62 amtrak has faced criticism from commuters as well as politicians for these incidents prompting responses from figures such as new jersey governor chris christie and new york governor andrew cuomo the repairs are expected to take place in summer 2017 affecting the long island rail road and new jersey transit trains during all hours who have planned additional or modified services.6364 in june 2017 it was announced that former delta and northwest airlines ceo richard anderson would become amtrak's next president  ceo 61 anderson began the job on july 12 assuming the title of president immediately and serving alongside moorman as co-ceos until the end of the year operationsedit routesedit amtrak is no longer required by law to operate a national route system but it is encouraged to do so.65 amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states lacking wyoming and south dakota amtrak services fall into three groups short-haul service on the northeast corridor state-supported short haul service outside the northeast corridor and long-distance service known within amtrak as the national network amtrak receives federal funding for the vast majority of its operations including the central spine of the northeast corridor between boston and washington dc as well as for its national long distance routes in addition to the federally funded routes amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the northeast corridor some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it in addition to its inter-city services amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including marc in maryland shore line east in connecticut and metrolink in california service on the northeast corridor between boston and washington d.c. as well as between philadelphia and harrisburg is powered by overhead electric wires for the rest of the system diesel locomotives are used routes vary widely in frequency of service from three-days-a-week trains on the sunset limited to weekday service several times per hour on the northeast corridor nec.66 amtrak also operates a captive bus service thruway motorcoach which provides connections to train routes.67 four of the six stations busiest by boardings are on the nec new york penn station first washington union station second philadelphia 30th street station third and boston south station sixth the other two are chicago union station fourth and los angeles union station fifth.70 efficiencyedit intermodal connectionsedit intermodal connections between amtrak trains and other transportation are available at many stations most amtrak rail stations in downtown areas have connections to local public transport amtrak also code shares with united airlines providing service between newark liberty international airport via its amtrak station and airtrain newark and philadelphia 30th st wilmington stamford and new haven special codes are used to designate these intermodal routes such as zve to designate the combination of new haven's union station and newark international airport and the amtrak connection between them amtrak also serves airport stations at milwaukee oakland burbank and baltimore.citation needed amtrak coordinates thruway motorcoach service to extend many of its routes especially in california.citation needed on-time performanceedit outside the northeast corridor and stretches of track in southern california and michigan most amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to amtrak trains some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track the railroads dispatching practices were investigated in 200882 resulting in stricter laws about train priority subsequently amtrak's overall on-time performance went up from 74.7 in fiscal 2008 to 84.7 in 2009 with long-distance trains and others outside the nec seeing the greatest benefit the missouri river runner jumped from 11 to 95% becoming one of amtrak's best performers the texas eagle went from 22.4 to 96.7% and the california zephyr with a 5 on-time record in 2008 went up to 78.3%.83 this improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn resulting in the lowest freight-rail traffic volumes since at least 1988 meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic.84 ridershipedit amtrak carried 15848327 passengers in 1972 its first full year of operation.85 ridership peaked in 2016 with a record 31272790 passengers double the total in 1972.86 guest rewardsedit amtrak's loyalty program guest rewards87 is similar to the frequent-flyer programs of many airlines guest rewards members accumulate points by riding amtrak and through other activities and can redeem these points for free or discounted amtrak tickets and other rewards.87 commuter servicesedit linesedit in addition to these lines amtrak owns station and yard tracks in chicago los angeles new orleans new york city oakland kirkham street yard orlando portland oregon saint paul seattle and washington d.c amtrak leases station and yard tracks in hialeah near miami florida from the state of florida.citation needed amtrak owns the chicago union station company chicago union station and new york penn station it has a 99.7 interest in the washington terminal company93 tracks around washington union station and 99 of 30th street limited philadelphia 30th street station also owned by amtrak is passenger railroad insurance.94 rolling stockedit amtrak owns 2142 railway cars and 425 locomotives for revenue runs and service examples include the ge p42dc the siemens acs-64 the amfleet car and the superliner car occasionally private cars or loaned locomotives from other railroads can be found on amtrak trains on-board servicesedit classes of serviceedit as of 2015update amtrak offers four classes of service first class sleeper service business class and coach class:95 wifi and electronic servicesedit amtrak launched an e-ticketing system on the downeaster in november 2011100 and rolled it out nationwide on july 30 2012 amtrak officials said the system gives more accurate knowledge in realtime of who is on the train which greatly improves the safety and security of passengers en route reporting of onboard equipment problems to mechanical crews which may result in faster resolution of the issue and more efficient financial reporting.101 amtrak first offered free wi-fi service to passengers aboard the downeaster in 2008 the acela express and the northeast regional trains on the nec in 2010 and the amtrak cascades in 2011 in february 2014 amtrak rolled out wi-fi on corridor trains out of chicago when all the midwest cars offer the amtrakconnect service about 85 of all amtrak passengers nationwide will have wi-fi access.102103 as of 2014update most amtrak passengers have access to free wi-fi the service has developed a reputation for being unreliable and slow.104105 baggageedit amtrak allows carry-on baggage on all routes services with baggage cars allow checked baggage at selected stations.citation needed with the passage of the wicker amendment in 2010 passengers are allowed to put lawfully owned unloaded firearms in checked amtrak baggage reversing a decade-long ban on such carriage.106 amtrak express reporting marks amtk amtz provides small-package and less-than-truckload shipping among more than 100 cities amtrak express also offers station-to-station shipment of human remains to many express cities at smaller stations funeral directors must load and unload the shipment onto and off the train amtrak hauled mail for the united states postal service and time-sensitive freight but canceled these services in october 2004 due to minuscule profits.107 on most parts of the few lines that amtrak owns trackage-rights agreements allow freight railroads to use its trackage company officersedit presidentsedit board of directorsedit labor issuesedit in the modern era amtrak faces a number of important labor issues in the area of pension funding because of limitations originally imposed by congress most amtrak workers were traditionally classified as railroad employees and contributions to the railroad retirement system have been made for those employees however because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work some critics such as the national association of railroad passengers maintain that amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as us$150 million/year.131 in recent times efforts at reforming passenger rail have addressed labor issues in 1997 congress released amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation and outside its unions opening the door to privatization.132 since that time many of amtrak's employees have been working without a contract the most recent contract signed in 1999 was mainly retroactive because of the fragmentation of railroad unions by job as of 2009update amtrak has 14 separate unions to negotiate with plus it has 24 separate contracts with those unions.133 this makes it difficult to make substantial changes in contrast to a situation where one union negotiates with one employer former amtrak president kummant followed a cooperative posture with amtrak's trade unions ruling out plans to privatize large parts of amtrak's unionized workforce.134 public fundingedit amtrak receives annual appropriations from federal and state governments to supplement operating and capital programs history of fundingedit 1970s to 1990sedit 2000sedit state governments have partially filled the breach left by reductions in federal aid several states have entered into operating partnerships with amtrak notably california pennsylvania illinois michigan oregon missouri washington north carolina oklahoma texas wisconsin vermont maine and new york as well as the canadian province of british columbia which provides some of the resources for the operation of the cascades route 2010sedit amtrak points out that in 2010 its farebox recovery percentage of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares was 79% the highest reported for any u.s passenger railroad.68 in fiscal year 2011 the u.s congress granted amtrak $563 million for operating and $922 million for capital programs.149 controversyedit the rail passenger service act of 1970 which established amtrak specifically states that the corporation will not be an agency or establishment of the united states government.154 then common stock was issued in 1971 to railroads that contributed capital and equipment these shares convey almost no benefits155 but their current holders156 declined a 2002 buy-out offer by amtrak there are currently 109396994 shares of preferred stock at a par value of $100 per share all held by the us government there are currently 9385694 shares of common stock with a par value of $10 per share held by four other railroad companies apu formerly penn central 53% bnsf 35% canadian pacific 7% and canadian

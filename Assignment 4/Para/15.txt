southern hemisphere when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools down considerably one of its main features is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees some

hemisphere3 use a definition based on months with autumn being september october and november in the northern hemisphere4 and march april and may in the southern hemisphere  contents  etymologyedit the word autumn comes from the ancient etruscan root autu and has within it connotations of the passing of the year.11 it was borrowed by the neighbouring romans and became the latin word autumnus.12 after the roman era the word continued to be used as the old french word autompne automne in modern french or autumpne in middle english13 and was later normalised to the original latin in the medieval period there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century but by the 16th century it was in common use before the 16th century harvest was the term usually used to refer to the season as it is common in other west germanic languages to this day cf dutch herfst german herbst and scots hairst however as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns the word harvest lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping and autumn as well as fall began to replace it as a reference to the season.1415 during the 17th century english emigration to the british colonies in north america was at its peak and the new settlers took the english language with them while the term fall gradually became obsolete in britain it became the more common term in north america the name backend a once common name for the season in northern england has today been largely replaced by the name autumn.17 associationsedit harvestedit association with the transition from warm to cold weather and its related status as the season of the primary harvest has dominated its themes and popular images in western cultures personifications of autumn are usually pretty well-fed females adorned with fruits vegetables and grains that ripen at this time many cultures feature autumnal harvest festivals often the most important on their calendars still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the autumn thanksgiving holiday of the united states and canada and the jewish sukkot holiday with its roots as a full-moon harvest festival of tabernacles living in outdoor huts around the time of harvest.citation needed there are also the many north american indian festivals tied to harvest of ripe foods gathered in the wild the chinese mid-autumn or moon festival and many others the predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather this view is presented in english poet john keats poem to autumn where he describes the season as a time of bounteous fecundity a time of 'mellow fruitfulness' while most foods are harvested during the autumn foods particularly associated with the season include pumpkins which are integral parts of both thanksgiving and halloween and apples which are used to make the seasonal beverage apple cider melancholiaedit autumn especially in poetry has often been associated with melancholia the possibilities of summer are gone and the chill of winter is on the horizon skies turn grey the amount of usable daylight drops rapidly and many people turn inward both physically and mentally.18 it has been referred to as an unhealthy season.19 similar examples may be found in irish poet william butler yeats poem the wild swans at coole where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents his own ageing self like the natural world that he observes he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death french poet paul verlaine's chanson d'automne autumn song is likewise characterised by strong painful feelings of sorrow keats to autumn written in september 1819 echoes this sense of melancholic reflection but also emphasises the lush abundance of the season

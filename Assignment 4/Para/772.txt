beautiful woman who turned out not only to be elegant and beautiful but very smart and willing to put up with my rough edges and i must confess has smoothed them off over time.33 bush has been an avid

147th reconnaissance wing out of the ellington field joint reserve base.4244 critics including former democratic national committee chairman terry mcauliffe have alleged that bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing as a member of the house of representatives citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.42 in june 2005 the united states department of defense released all the records of bush's texas air national guard service which remain in its official archives.45 in late 1972 and early 1973 he drilled with the 187th fighter wing of the alabama air national guard he had moved to montgomery alabama to work on the unsuccessful u.s senate campaign of republican winton m blount.4647 in 1972 bush was

spectrum 7 and bush became chairman.52 the company was hurt by decreased oil prices and it folded into hkn inc.5253 with bush becoming a member of hkn's board of directors.52 questions of possible insider trading involving hkn arose but a securities and exchange commission sec investigation concluded that the information bush had at the time of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.5254 early political involvement in 1978 bush ran for the house of representatives from texas's 19th congressional district the retiring member george h mahon had held the district for the democratic party since 1935 bush's opponent kent hance portrayed him as out of touch with rural texans and bush lost the election with 46.8 percent of the vote to hance's 53.2 percent.58 bush and his family moved to washington d.c. in 1988 to work on his father's campaign for the u.s presidency.5960 he served as a campaign advisor and liaison to the media and assisted his father by campaigning across the country.52 in december 1991 bush was one of seven people named by his father to run his father's 1992 presidential re-election campaign as a campaign advisor.61 the previous month his father had asked him to tell white house chief of staff john h sununu that he should resign.62 bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 texas gubernatorial election at the same time that his brother jeb sought the governorship of florida his campaign focused on four themes welfare reform tort reform crime reduction and education improvement.52 bush's campaign advisers were karen hughes joe allbaugh and karl rove.63 bush used a budget surplus to push through texas's largest tax-cut $2 billion.63 he extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse and helping to reduce domestic violence.70 critics contended that during his tenure texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.52 in 1999 bush signed a law that required electric retailers to buy a certain amount of energy from renewable sources rps717273 which helped texas eventually become the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the u.s.747576 throughout bush's first term national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate following his re-election speculation soared.52 within a year he decided to seek the 2000 republican presidential nomination presidential campaigns 2000 presidential candidacy primary incumbent democratic president bill clinton was completing his second and final term and the field for nomination for president of both parties was wide open bush was the governor of texas in june 1999 when he announced his candidacy for president of the united states he entered a large field of hopefuls for the republican party presidential nomination that included john mccain alan keyes steve forbes gary bauer orrin hatch elizabeth dole dan quayle pat buchanan lamar alexander john kasich and bob smith bush portrayed himself as a compassionate conservative implying he was more centrist than other republicans he campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the white house increasing the size of the united states armed forces cutting taxes improving education and aiding minorities.52 by early 2000 the race had centered on bush and mccain.52 general election bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as governor of texas.52 during his campaign bush criticized his democratic opponent incumbent vice president al gore over gun control and taxation.83 when the election returns were tallied on november 7 bush had won 29 states including florida the closeness of the florida outcome led to a recount.52 the initial recount also went to bush but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the u.s supreme court.84 on december 9 in the controversial bush v gore ruling85 the court reversed a florida supreme court decision that had ordered a third count and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on the argument that the use of different standards among florida's counties violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.52 the machine recount showed that bush had won the florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast.86 although he had received 543895 fewer individual nationwide votes than gore bush won the election receiving 271 electoral votes to gore's 266 gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267 however one of gore's pledged electors abstained rendering the official tally at 266 bush was the first person to win an american presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since benjamin harrison in 1888.86 2004 presidential candidacy in his 2004 bid for re-election bush commanded broad support in the republican party and did not encounter a primary challenge he appointed ken mehlman as campaign manager and karl rove devised a political strategy .87 bush and the republican platform emphasized a strong commitment to the wars in iraq and afghanistan88 support for the usa patriot act89 a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and same-sex marriage8890 reforming social security to create private investment accounts88 creation of an ownership society88 and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.91 bush also called for the implementation of a guest worker program for immigrants88 which was criticized by conservatives.92 the bush campaign advertised across the u.s against democratic candidates including bush's emerging opponent massachusetts senator john kerry kerry and other democrats attacked bush on the iraq war and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth the bush campaign portrayed kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government the bush campaign continuously criticized kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in iraq52 and argued that kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the war on terror bush had originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda but his priorities were significantly altered following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks.94 wars were waged in afghanistan and iraq and there were significant domestic debates regarding immigration healthcare social security economic policy and treatment of terrorist detainees over an eight-year period bush's once-high approval ratings95 steadily declined while his disapproval numbers increased significantly.96 in 2007 the united states entered the longest post-world war ii recession.97 domestic policy economic policy the increase in spending was more than under any predecessor since lyndon b johnson.100 the number of economic regulation governmental workers increased by 91196.101 bush entered office with the dow jones industrial average at 10587 and the average peaked in october 2007 at over 14000 when bush left office the average was at 7949 one of the lowest levels of his presidency.109 many economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the great depression.129130 additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial according to former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan.131 bush meanwhile proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the u.s mortgage market.132 vince reinhardt a former federal reserve economist now at the american enterprise institute said it would have helped for the bush administration to empower the folks at treasury and the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the fdic to look at these issues more closely and additionally that it would have helped for congress to have held hearings.126 education and health bush undertook a number of educational agendas such as increasing the funding for the national science foundation and national institutes of health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for american high school students funding for the nih was cut in 2006 the first such cut in 36 years due to rising inflation.136 one of the administration's early major initiatives was the no child left behind act which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools and target more federal funding to low-income schools this landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of senator ted kennedy of massachusetts.137 it was signed into law by bush in early 2002.138 many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the u.s have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since bush signed no child left behind into law.139 critics argue that it is underfunded140 and that nclba's focus on high-stakes testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive.141 social services and social security bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform social security147 which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005 bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the u.s congress.147 in his 2005 state of the union address bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program which included partial privatization of the system personal social security accounts and options to permit americans to divert a portion of their social security tax fica into secured investments.147 democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.147 bush embarked on a 60-day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as conversations on social security in an attempt to gain public support.148 nevertheless public support for the proposal declined149 and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.150 the proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from hurricane katrina.151 after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections there was no prospect of further congressional action on the bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office environmental policies in may 2001 bush signed an executive order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects154 and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues.155 in 2002 bush announced the clear skies act of 2003156 aimed at amending the clean air act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.157 the initiative was introduced to congress but failed to make it out of committee bush has said that he believes that global warming is real160 and has noted that it is a serious problem but he asserted there is a debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused.161 the bush administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities critics have alleged that the administration162 misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.163 energy policies in his 2006 state of the union address bush declared america is addicted to oil and announced his advanced energy initiative to increase energy development research.164 in his 2007 state of the union address bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production.165 amid high gasoline prices in 2008 bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling.166 however the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling bush said this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the u.s congress.166 bush had said in june 2008 in the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies my administration has worked with congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.. in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil and that means we need to increase supply especially here at home so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil production.167 stem cell research and first veto federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the department of health and human services and the national institutes of health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the dickey-wicker amendment by congress and the signature of president bill clinton.169 bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research however bush did not support embryonic stem cell research.170 on august 9 2001 bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing lines of stem cells171 but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines.172 on july 19 2006 bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the stem cell research enhancement act the bill would have repealed the dickey-wicker amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.173 genetic nondiscrimination on may 21 2008 president george w bush signed into law the genetic information nondiscrimination act gina.174175 the bill aims to protect americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment the issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law it is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research immigration on september 19 2010 former israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that bush offered to accept 100000 palestinian refugees as american citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between israel and the palestinian authority.186 hurricane katrina hurricane katrina one of the most damaging natural disasters in u.s history struck early in bush's second term katrina formed in late august during the 2005 atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central gulf coast of the united states particularly new orleans.187 bush declared a state of emergency in louisiana on august 27188 and in mississippi and alabama the following day;189 he authorized the department of homeland security dhs and federal emergency management agency fema to manage the disaster but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action.190 the eye of the hurricane made landfall on august 29 and new orleans began to flood due to levee breaches later that day bush declared that a major disaster existed in louisiana191 officially authorizing fema to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort on august 30 dhs secretary michael chertoff declared it an incident of national significance192 triggering the first use of the newly created national response plan three days later on september 2 national guard troops first entered the city of new orleans.193 the same day bush toured parts of louisiana mississippi and alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was not enough.194 as the disaster in new orleans intensified critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what they saw as a flawed response leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema notably michael d brown;195 it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the iraq war196 and bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods.197198199 bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.193 it has been argued that with katrina bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.200 midterm dismissal of u.s attorneys during bush's second term a controversy arose over the justice department's midterm dismissal of seven united states attorneys.201 the white house maintained that the u.s attorneys were fired for poor performance.202 attorney general alberto gonzales later resigned over the issue along with other senior members of the justice department.203204 the house judiciary committee issued subpoenas for advisers harriet miers and josh bolten to testify regarding this matter but bush directed miers and bolten to not comply with those subpoenas invoking his right of executive privilege bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice the justice department determined that the president's order was legal.205 although congressional investigations focused on whether the justice department and the white house were using the u.s attorney positions for political advantage no official findings have been released on march 10 2008 the congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.206 on july 31 2008 a united states district court judge ruled that bush's top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenas.207 in all twelve justice department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before congress they included attorney general alberto gonzales208 and his chief of staff kyle sampson209 gonzales liaison to the white house monica goodling210 aide to the president karl rove211 and his senior aide sara taylor.212 in addition legal counsel to the president harriet miers213 and deputy chief of staff to the president joshua bolten214 were both found in contempt of congress.212 in 2010 the justice department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings215 the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal according to the prosecutors there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense.216 purge of the central intelligence agency following the resignation of cia director george tenet in 2004 bush nominated porter goss to head the agency the white house ordered goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration.217 after goss appointment many of the cia's senior agents were fired or quit the cia has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.218 foreign policy in july 2001 bush visited pope john paul ii at castel gandolfo.219 during his presidential campaign bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with latin america especially mexico and a reduction of involvement in nation-building and other small-scale military engagements the administration pursued a national missile defense.220 bush was an advocate of china's entry into the world trade organization.221 in his 2002 state of the union address bush referred to an axis of evil including iraq iran and north korea.222 after the september 11 attacks on new york bush launched the war on terror in which the united states military and a small international coalition invaded afghanistan in 2003 bush then launched the invasion of iraq searching for weapons of mass destruction which he described as being part of the war on terrorism.223 those invasions led to the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan and the removal of saddam hussein from power in iraq bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with european nations he appointed long-time adviser karen hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in georgia and ukraine.224 bush's visit was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor bill clinton whose approach and response to india after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring the relationship between india and the united states was one that dramatically improved during bush's tenure.227 midway through bush's second term questions arose whether bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former soviet republics in central asia.228 in an address before both houses of congress on september 20 2001 bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the september 11 attacks he specifically thanked uk prime minister tony blair for traveling to washington to show unity of purpose with america and said america has no truer friend than great britain.229 september 11 attacks the september 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in bush's presidency that evening he addressed the nation from the oval office promising a strong response to the attacks he also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims three days after the attacks bush visited ground zero and met with mayor rudy giuliani firefighters police officers and volunteers to much applause bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.230 in a september 20 speech bush condemned osama bin laden and his organization al-qaeda and issued an ultimatum to the taliban regime in afghanistan where bin laden was operating to hand over the terrorists or .. share in their fate.231 war on terrorism after september 11 bush announced a global war on terror the afghan taliban regime was not forthcoming with osama bin laden so bush ordered the invasion of afghanistan to overthrow the taliban regime.232 in his january 29 2002 state of the union address he asserted that an axis of evil consisting of north korea iran and iraq was arming to threaten the peace of the world and posed a grave and growing danger.233 the bush administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war.234 this became the basis for the bush doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the united states which had followed the september 11 attacks.235 afghanistan invasion on october 7 2001 u.s and british forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of northern alliance troops in kabul on november 13 the main goals of the war were to defeat the taliban drive al-qaeda out of afghanistan and capture key al-qaeda leaders in december 2001 the pentagon reported that the taliban had been defeated241 but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening taliban and al-qaeda leaders.241 later that month the un had installed the afghan transitional administration chaired by hamid karzai.242243 in 2002 based on unicef figures nicholas kristof reported that our invasion of afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.244 efforts to kill or capture al-qaeda leader osama bin laden failed as he escaped a battle in december 2001 in the mountainous region of tora bora which the bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough u.s ground troops.245 it was not until may 2011 two years after bush left office that bin laden was killed by u.s forces under the obama administration bin laden's successor ayman al-zawahiri remains at large despite the initial success in driving the taliban from power in kabul by early 2003 the taliban was regrouping amassing new funds and recruits.246 the 2005 failure of operation red wings showed that the taliban had returned.247 in 2006 the taliban insurgency appeared larger fiercer and better organized than expected with large-scale allied offensives such as operation mountain thrust attaining limited success.248249250 as a result bush commissioned 3500 additional troops to the country in march 2007.251 iraq invasion beginning with his january 29 2002 state of the union address bush began publicly focusing attention on iraq which he labeled as part of an axis of evil allied with terrorists and posing a grave and growing danger to u.s interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction.233252 in the latter half of 2002 cia reports contained assertions of saddam hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs not properly accounting for iraqi biological and chemical weapons and that some iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the un sanctions.253254 contentions that the bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.255256 in late 2002 and early 2003 bush urged the united nations to enforce iraqi disarmament mandates precipitating a diplomatic crisis in november 2002 hans blix and mohamed elbaradei led un weapons inspectors in iraq but were advised by the u.s to depart the country four days prior to the u.s invasion despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.257 the u.s initially sought a un security council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for un approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.258 more than 20 nations most notably the united kingdom designated the coalition of the willing joined the united states259 in invading iraq they launched the invasion on march 20 2003 the iraqi military was quickly defeated the capital baghdad fell on april 9 2003 on may 1 bush declared the end of major combat operations in iraq the initial success of u.s operations increased his popularity but the u.s and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups bush's mission accomplished speech was later criticized as premature.260 from 2004 until 2007 the situation in iraq deteriorated further with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in iraq.261 bush's policies met with criticism including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from iraq the 2006 report of the bipartisan iraq study group led by james baker concluded that the situation in iraq was grave and deteriorating while bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of iraq262 he maintained he would not change the overall iraq strategy.263264 according to iraq body count some 251000 iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the u.s.-led invasion including at least 163841 civilians.265 in january 2005 free democratic elections were held in iraq for the first time in 50 years.266 according to iraqi national security advisor mowaffak al-rubaie this is the greatest day in the history of this country.266 bush praised the event as well saying that the iraqis have taken rightful control of their country's destiny.266 this led to the election of jalal talabani as president and nouri al-maliki as prime minister of iraq a referendum to approve a constitution in iraq was held in october 2005 supported by most shiites and many kurds.267 in march 2008 bush praised the iraqi government's bold decision to launch the battle of basra against the mahdi army calling it a defining moment in the history of a free iraq.271 he said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding general david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008 he also praised the iraqis legislative achievements including a pension law a revised de-baathification law a new budget an amnesty law and a provincial powers measure that he said set the stage for the iraqi elections.272 by july 2008 american troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began273 and due to increased stability in iraq bush announced the withdrawal of additional american forces.273 surveillance following the events of september 11 bush

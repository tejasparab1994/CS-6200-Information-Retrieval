coriolis frequency thus the coriolis parameterfdisplaystyle f is the angular velocity or frequency required to maintain a body at a fixed circle of latitude or zonal region if the coriolis parameter is large the effect of the earth's rotation on the body is significant since it will need a larger angular frequency to stay in equilibrium with the coriolis forces alternatively if the coriolis parameter is small the effect of the earth's rotation is small since only a small fraction of the centripetal force on the body is canceled by the coriolis force thus the magnitude offdisplaystyle f strongly affects the relevant dynamics contributing to the body's motion these considerations are captured in the nondimensionalized rossby number in stability calculations the rate of change offdisplaystyle f along the meridional direction becomes significant this is called the rossby parameter and is usually denoted whereydisplaystyle y is the in the local direction of increasing meridian this parameter becomes important for example in calculations involving rossby waves see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

atmospheric sounding an atmospheric sounding is a measurement of vertical distribution of physical properties of the atmospheric column such as pressure temperature wind speed and wind direction thus deriving wind shear liquid water content ozone concentration pollution and other properties such measurements are performed in a variety of ways including remote sensing and in situ observations the most common in situ sounding is a radiosonde which usually is a weather balloon but can also be a rocketsonde remote sensing soundings generally use passive infrared and microwave radiometers  contents  direct methodsedit sensors that measure atmospheric constituents directly such as thermometers barometers and humidity sensors can be sent aloft on balloons rockets or dropsondes they can also be carried on the outer hulls of ships and aircraft or even mounted on towers in this case all that is needed to capture the measurements are storage devices and/or transponders indirect methodsedit viewing geometryedit a limb sounder looks at the edge of the atmosphere where it is visible above the earth it does this in one of two ways either it tracks the sun moon a star or another transmitting satellite through the limb as the source gets occultated behind the earth or it looks towards empty space collecting radiation that is scattered from one of these sources in contrast a nadir-looking atmospheric sounder looks down through the atmosphere at the surface the sciamachy instrument operates in all three of these modes atmospheric inverse problemedit statement of the problemedit the following applies mainly to passive sensors but has some applicability to active sensors typically there is a vector of values of the quantity to be retrievedxdisplaystyle vec x called the state vector and a vector of measurementsydisplaystyle vec y the state vector could be temperatures ozone number densities humidities etc the measurement vector is typically counts radiances or brightness temperatures from a radiometer or similar detector but could include any other quantity germain to the problem the forward model maps the state vector to the measurement vector methods of solutionedit list of methodsedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

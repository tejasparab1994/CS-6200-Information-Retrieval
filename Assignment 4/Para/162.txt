isothermal process  contents  examplesedit isothermal processes can occur in any kind of system that has some means of regulating the temperature including highly structured machines and even living cells some parts of the cycles of some heat engines are carried out isothermally for example in the carnot cycle.1 in the thermodynamic analysis of chemical reactions it is usual to first analyze what happens under isothermal conditions and then consider the effect of temperature.2 phase changes such as melting or evaporation are also isothermal processes when as is usually the case they occur at constant pressure.3 isothermal processes are often used and a starting point in analyzing more complex non-isothermal processes isothermal processes are of special interest for ideal gases this is a consequence of joule's second law which states that the internal energy of a fixed amount of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature.4 thus in an isothermal process the internal energy of an ideal gas is constant this is a result of the fact that in an ideal gas there are no intermolecular forces.4 note that this is true only for ideal gases the internal energy depends on pressure as well as on temperature for liquids solids and real gases.5 in the isothermal compression of a gas there is work done on the system to decrease the volume and increase the pressure.4 doing work on the gas increases the internal energy and will tend to increase the temperature to maintain the constant temperature energy must leave the system as heat and enter the environment if the gas is ideal the amount of energy entering the environment is equal to the work done on the gas because internal energy does not change for details of the calculations see calculation of work details for an ideal gasedit holds the family of curves generated by this equation is shown in the graph in figure 1 each curve is called an isotherm such graphs are termed indicator diagrams and were first used by james watt and others to monitor the efficiency of engines the temperature corresponding to each curve in the figure increases from the lower left to the upper right calculation of workedit in thermodynamics the reversible work involved when a gas changes from state a to state b is6 by convention work is defined as the work on the system by its surroundings if for example the system is compressed then the work is positive and the internal energy of the system increases conversely if the system expands it does work on the surroundings and the internal energy of the system decreases entropy changesedit where qrev is the heat transferred reversibly to the system and t is absolute temperature.7 this formula is valid only for a hypothetical reversible process that is a process in which equilibrium is maintained at all times another example is the reversible isothermal expansion or compression of an ideal gas from an initial volume va and pressure pa to a final volume vb and pressure pb as shown in calculation of work the heat transferred to the gas is this result is for a reversible process so it may be substituted in the formula for the entropy change to obtain7 since an ideal gas obey's boyle's law this can be rewritten if desired as etymologyedit see alsoedit referencesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

equator  contents  overviewedit the latitude of the earth's equator is by definition 0 zero degrees of arc the equator is one of the five notable circles of latitude on earth the other four are the two polar circles the arctic circle and the antarctic circle and the two tropical circles the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn the equator is the only line of latitude which is also a great circle  that is one whose plane passes through the center of the globe the plane of earth's equator when projected outwards to the celestial sphere defines the celestial equator in the cycle of earth's seasons the plane of the equator passes through the sun twice per year at the march and september equinoxes to an observer on the earth the sun appears to travel north or south over the equator or the celestial equator at these times light rays from the center of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth at the point of solar noon on the equator locations on the equator experience the quickest sunrises and sunsets because the sun moves nearly perpendicular to the horizon for most of the year the length of daylight sunrise to sunset is almost constant throughout the year it is about fourteen minutes longer than nighttime due to atmospheric refraction and the fact that sunrise is begun or sunset is ended as the upper edge not the centre of the sun's disk crosses the horizon sites near the equator such as the guiana space centre in kourou french guiana are good locations for spaceports as they have a faster rotational speed than other latitudes the added velocity reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft because the earth spins to the east spacecraft must also launch to the east or to the southeast or northeast to take advantage of this earth-boost of speed.citation needed geodesyedit precise locationedit exact lengthedit crossing-the-equator ceremoniesedit certain navies such as the royal navy russian navy and us navy have a tradition of holding ceremonies aboard ships to mark sailors first crossing of the equator these rites of initiation have in the past been notorious for their brutality.citation needed milder line-crossing ceremonies typically featuring king neptune are also held for passengers entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise ships.citation needed equatorial countries and territoriesedit the equator traverses the land of 11 countries starting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards the equator passes through equatorial seasons and climateedit seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined toward or away from the sun according to earth's position in its orbit the hemisphere inclined toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter see solstice at the equinoxes the earth's axis is not tilted toward the sun instead it is perpendicular to the sun meaning that the day is about 12 hours long as is the night across the whole of the earth the equator lies mostly on the three largest oceans the atlantic ocean the indian ocean and the pacific ocean near the equator there is little temperature fluctuation throughout the year though there may be dramatic differences in rainfall and humidity the terms summer autumn winter and spring do not generally apply lowlands around the equator generally have a tropical rainforest climate also known as an equatorial climate though cold currents cause some regions to have tropical monsoon climates with a dry season in the middle of the year and the somali current generated by the asian monsoon due to continental heating via the high tibetan plateau causes greater somalia to have an arid climate despite its equatorial location see alsoedit referencesedit sourcesedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

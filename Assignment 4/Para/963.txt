baikonur cosmodrome the spaceport is currently leased by the kazakh government to russia until 2050 and is managed jointly by the roscosmos state corporation and the russian aerospace forces both sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite and vostok 1 the first human spaceflight were launched from baikonur the launch pad used for both missions was renamed gagarin's start in honor of russian soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin pilot of vostok 1 and first human in space  contents  historyedit soviet eraedit the american u-2 high-altitude reconnaissance plane found and photographed the tyuratam missile test range for the first time on 5 august 1957 nameedit other sources state that baikonur was name of the tyuratam region even before the cosmodrome existed.7 the main cosmodrome-supporting town leninsk was renamed to baikonur on 20 december 1995 by boris yeltsin environmental impactedit russian scientist afanasiy ilich tobonov researched mass animal deaths in the 1990s and concluded that the mass deaths of birds and wildlife in the sakha republic were noted only along the flight paths of space rockets launched from the baikonur cosmodrome.8 dead wildlife and livestock were usually incinerated and the participants in these incinerations including tobonov himself his brothers and inhabitants of his native village of eliptyan commonly died from stroke or cancer in 1997 the ministry of defense of the russian federation changed the flight path and removed the ejected rocket stages near nyurbinsky district russia.citation needed scientific literature collected enough data that confirmed adverse effects of rockets on environment and health of the population.9 heptyl or udmh a fuel used in russian rocket engines is considered to be highly toxic it is one of the reasons for acid rains and cancers in the local population near the cosmodrome valery yakovlev a head of the laboratory of ecosystem research of the state scientific-production union of applied ecology kazmechanobr notes scientists have established the extreme character of destructive influence of baikonur space center on environment and population of the region 11 000 tons of space scrap metal polluted by especially toxic heptyl is still laying on the falling grounds. 10 importanceedit many historic flights lifted off from baikonur the first operational icbm the first man-made satellite sputnik 1 on 4 october 1957 the first spacecraft to travel close to the moon luna 1 on 2 january 1959 the first manned and orbital flight by yuri gagarin on 12 april 1961 and the flight of the first woman in space valentina tereshkova in 1963 14 cosmonauts of 13 other nations such as czechoslovakia east germany india and france started their journeys from here as well under the interkosmos program in 1960 a prototype r-16 icbm exploded before launch killing over 100 people baikounr is also the site where venera 9 and mars 3 were launched from russian eraedit with the retirement of the american space shuttle program baikonur has been the only launch site for international space station missions using russian spacecraft.4 following the conclusion of the space shuttle program russian spacecraft are now the only means by which astronauts can travel to the international space station making baikonur the sole launch site used for manned missions to the iss.15 featuresedit baikonur is fully equipped with facilities for launching both manned and unmanned spacecraft it supports several generations of russian spacecraft soyuz proton tsyklon dnepr zenit and buran during the temporary lapse of the united states space shuttle program after the columbia disaster in 2003 it played an essential role in operating and resupplying of the international space station iss with soyuz and progress spacecraft its high latitude of 46 n required the high orbital inclination of the iss.16 downrange from the launchpad spent launch equipment is dropped directly on the ground where it is salvaged by the workers and the local population.17 list of launchpadsedit buran facilitiesedit as part of the buran program several facilities were adapted or newly built for the buran-class space shuttle orbiters baikonur railwayedit baikonur airportsedit icbm testingedit although baikonur has always been known around the world as the launch site of soviet and russian space missions from its outset in 1955 and until the collapse of the ussr in 1991 the primary purpose of this center was to test liquid-fueled ballistic missiles the official and secret name of the center was state test range no 5 or 5 gik it remained under control of the soviet and russian ministry of defense until the second half of the 1990s when the russian civilian space agency and its industrial contractors started taking over individual facilities.citation needed in 2006 the head of roskosmos anatoly perminov said that the last russian military personnel would be removed from the baikonur facility by 2007 however on 22 october 2008 an ss-19 stiletto missile was test fired from baikonur indicating this may not be the case.23 future projectsedit baikonur museumedit baikonur cosmodrome has a small museum next to two small cottages once residences of sergey korolev and yuri gagarin both cottages are part of the museum complex and have been preserved the museum is home to a collection of space artifacts a restored test artifact from the soviet buran programme sits next to the museum entrance the vehicle that flew a single orbital test mission in 1988 was destroyed in a hangar collapse in 2002;282930 for a complete list of buran artifacts see buran spacecraft the museum also houses photographs related to the cosmodrome's history including images of all cosmonauts every crew of every expedition launched from baikonur leaves behind a signed crew photograph that is displayed behind the glass baikonur's museum holds many objects related to gagarin including the ground control panel from his flight his uniforms and soil from his landing site preserved in a silver container one of the museum rooms also holds an older version of the soyuz descent capsule in popular cultureedit see

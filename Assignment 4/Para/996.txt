mir mir was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and held the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3644 days until it was surpassed by the iss on 23 october 2010.13 it holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight with valeri polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995 mir was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan having the capacity to support a resident crew of three or larger crews for short visits  contents  originsedit mir was authorized on a 17 february 1976 decree to design an improved model of the salyut dos-17k space stations four salyut space stations had been launched since 1971 with three more being launched during mir's development it was planned that the station's core module dos-7 and the backup dos-8 would be equipped with a total of four docking ports two at either end of the station as with the salyut stations and an additional two ports on either side of a docking sphere at the front of the station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities by august 1978 this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.15 it was originally planned that the ports would connect to 7.5-tonne 8.3-short-ton modules derived from the soyuz spacecraft these modules would have used a soyuz propulsion module as in soyuz and progress and the descent and orbital modules would have been replaced with a long laboratory module.15 following a february 1979 governmental resolution the programme was consolidated with vladimir chelomei's manned almaz military space station programme the docking ports were reinforced to accommodate 20-tonne 22-short-ton space station modules based on the tks spacecraft npo energia was responsible for the overall space station with work subcontracted to kb salyut due to ongoing work on the energia rocket and salyut 7 soyuz-t and progress spacecraft kb salyut began work in 1979 and drawings were released in 1982 and 1983 new systems incorporated into the station included the salyut 5b digital flight control computer and gyrodyne flywheels taken from almaz kurs automatic rendezvous system luch satellite communications system elektron oxygen generators and vozdukh carbon dioxide scrubbers.15 by early 1984 work on mir had halted while all resources were being put into the buran programme in order to prepare the buran spacecraft for flight testing funding resumed in early 1984 when valentin glushko was ordered by the central committee's secretary for space and defence to orbit mir by early 1986 in time for the 27th communist party congress.15 it was clear that the planned processing flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date it was decided on cosmonaut's day 12 april 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there the module arrived at the launch site on 6 may with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework based on the results of tests to the ground test model at khrunichev in october the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests the first launch attempt on 16 february 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed but the second launch attempt on 19 february 1986 at 21:28:23 utc was successful meeting the political deadline.15 station structureedit assemblyedit the orbital assembly of mir began on february 19 1986 with the launch of the proton-k rocket four of the six modules which were later added kvant-2 in 1989 kristall in 1990 spektr in 1995 and priroda in 1996 followed the same sequence to be added to the main mir complex firstly the module would be launched independently on its own proton-k and chase the station automatically it would then dock to the forward docking port on the core module's docking node then extend its lyappa arm to mate with a fixture on the node's exterior the arm would then lift the module away from the forward docking port and rotate it on to the radial port where it was to mate before lowering it to dock the node was equipped with only two konus drogues which were required for dockings this meant that prior to the arrival of each new module the node would have to be depressurised to allow spacewalking cosmonauts to manually relocate the drogue to the next port to be occupied.617 the other two expansion modules kvant-1 in 1987 and the docking module in 1995 followed different procedures kvant-1 having unlike the four modules mentioned above no engines of its own was launched attached to a tug based on the tks spacecraft which delivered the module to the aft end of the core module instead of the docking node once hard docking had been achieved the tug undocked and deorbited itself the docking module meanwhile was launched aboard space shuttle atlantis during sts-74 and mated to the orbiter's orbiter docking system atlantis then docked via the module to kristall then left the module behind when it undocked later in the mission.1718 various other external components including three truss structures several experiments and other unpressurised elements were also mounted to the exterior of the station by cosmonauts conducting a total of eighty spacewalks over the course of the station's history.17 the station's assembly marked the beginning of the third generation of space station design being the first to consist of more than one primary spacecraft thus opening a new era in space architecture first generation stations such as salyut 1 and skylab had monolithic designs consisting of one module with no resupply capability the second generation stations salyut 6 and salyut 7 comprised a monolithic station with two ports to allow consumables to be replenished by cargo spacecraft such as progress the capability of mir to be expanded with add-on modules meant that each could be designed with a specific purpose in mind for instance the core module functioned largely as living quarters thus eliminating the need to install all the station's equipment in one module.17 pressurised modulesedit in its completed configuration the space station consisted of seven different modules each launched into orbit separately over a period of ten years by either proton-k rockets or space shuttle atlantis unpressurised elementsedit in addition to the pressurised modules mir featured several external components the largest component was the sofora girder a large scaffolding-like structure consisting of 20 segments which when assembled projected 14 metres from its mount on kvant-1 a self-contained thruster block the vdu was mounted on the end of sofora and was used to augment the roll-control thrusters on the core module the vdu's increased distance from mir's axis allowed an 85 decrease in fuel consumption reducing the amount of propellant required to orient the station.17 a second girder rapana was mounted aft of sofora on kvant-1 this girder a small prototype of a structure intended to be used on mir-2 to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments.17 each module was fitted with external components specific to the experiments that were carried out within that module the most obvious being the travers antenna mounted to priroda this synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module with associated equipment within used for earth observations experiments as was most of the other equipment on priroda including various radiometers and scan platforms.19 kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit or ikar was mated this backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned buran in a manner similar to the us manned maneuvering unit but it was only used once during eo-5.17 in addition to module-specific equipment kvant-2 kristall spektr and priroda were each equipped with one lyappa arm a robotic arm which after the module had docked to the core module's forward port grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's docking node the arriving module's docking probe was then retracted and the arm raised the module so that it could be pivoted 90 for docking to one of the four radial docking ports.19 power supplyedit orbit controledit communicationsedit radio communications provided telemetry and scientific data links between mir and the rka mission control centre tsup radio links were also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members flight controllers and family members as a result mir was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes the station communicated directly with the ground via the lira antenna mounted to the core module the lira antenna also had the capability to use the luch data relay satellite system which fell into disrepair in the 1990s and the network of soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world which also became unavailable in the 1990s.17 uhf radio was used by cosmonauts conducting evas uhf was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station such as soyuz progress and the space shuttle in order to receive commands from the tsup and mir crew members via the toru system.17 microgravityedit at mir's orbital altitude the force of earth's gravity was 88 of sea level gravity while the constant free fall of the station offered a perceived sensation of weightlessness the onboard environment was not one of weightlessness or zero gravity the environment was often described as microgravity this state of perceived weightlessness was not perfect being disturbed by five separate effects:23 life supportedit international cooperationedit intercosmosedit only the last three of the programme's fourteen missions consisted of an expedition to mir but none resulted in an extended stay in the station european involvementedit various european astronauts visited mir as part of several cooperative programmes:29 in the early 1980s nasa planned to launch a modular space station called freedom as a counterpart to mir while the soviets were planning to construct mir-2 in the 1990s as a replacement for the station.17 because of budget and design constraints freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and with the fall of the soviet union and the end of the space race the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the united states house of representatives the post-soviet economic chaos in russia also led to the cancellation of mir-2 though only after its base block dos-8 had been constructed.17 similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects which prompted the us government to negotiate with european states russia japan and canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project.17 in june 1992 american president george h w bush and russian president boris yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration the resulting agreement between the united states of america and the russian federation concerning cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes called for a short joint space programme with one american astronaut deployed to the russian space station mir and two russian cosmonauts deployed to a space shuttle.17 other visitorsedit life on boardedit crew scheduleedit the time zone used on board mir was moscow time utc+03 the windows were covered during night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experienced 16 sunrises and sunsets a day a typical day for the crew began with a wake-up at 08:00 followed by two hours of personal hygiene and breakfast work was conducted from 10:00 until 13:00 followed by an hour of exercise and an hour's lunch break three more hours of work and another hour of exercise followed lunch and the crews began preparing for their evening meal at about 19:00 the cosmonauts were free to do as they wished in the evening and largely worked to their own pace during the day.17 in their spare time crews were able to catch up with work observe the earth below respond to letters drawings and other items brought from earth and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard mir or make use of the station's ham radio.17 two amateur radio call signs u1mir and u2mir were assigned to mir in the late 1980s allowing amateur radio operators on earth to communicate with the cosmonauts.36 the station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.22 nasa astronaut jerry linenger related how life on board mir was structured and lived according to the detailed itineraries provided by ground control every second on board was accounted for and all activities were timetabled after working some time on mir linenger came to feel that the order in which his activities were allocated did not represent the most logical or efficient order possible for these activities he decided to perform his tasks in an order that he felt enabled him to work more efficiently be less fatigued and suffer less from stress linenger noted that his comrades on mir did not improvise in this way and as a medical doctor he observed the effects of stress on his comrades that he believed was the outcome of following an itinerary without making modifications to it despite this he commented that his comrades performed all their tasks in a supremely professional manner.37 astronaut shannon lucid who set the record for longest stay in space by a woman while aboard mir surpassed by sunita williams 11 years later on the iss also commented about working aboard mir saying i think going to work on a daily basis on mir is very similar to going to work on a daily basis on an outstation in antarctica the big difference with going to work here is the isolation because you really are isolated you don't have a lot of support from the ground you really are on your own.35 exerciseedit the most significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton or spaceflight osteopenia other significant effects include fluid redistribution a slowing of the cardiovascular system decreased production of red blood cells balance disorders and a weakening of the immune system lesser symptoms include loss of body mass nasal congestion sleep disturbance excess flatulence and puffiness of the face these effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the earth.38 hygieneedit there were two space toilets asus on mir located in the core module and kvant-2.22 they used a fan-driven suction system similar to the space shuttle waste collection system the user is first fastened to the toilet seat which was equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal a lever operated a powerful fan and a suction hole slid open the air stream carried the waste away solid waste was collected in individual bags which were stored in an aluminium container full containers were transferred to progress spacecraft for disposal liquid waste was evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet with anatomically appropriate urine funnel adapters attached to the tube so both men and women could use the same toilet waste was collected and transferred to the water recovery system where it was recycled back into drinking water although this was usually used to produce oxygen via the elektron system.17 mir featured a shower the bania located in kvant-2 it was an improvement on the units installed in previous salyut stations but proved difficult to use due to the time required to set up use and stow the shower which featured a plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow was later converted into a steam room it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused when the shower was unavailable crew members washed using wet wipes with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood located in the core module crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.17 on a 1998 visit to mir bacteria and larger organisms were found to have proliferated in water globules formed from moisture that had condensed behind service panels.40 sleeping in spaceedit the station provided two permanent crew quarters the kayutkas phonebox-sized booths set towards the rear of the core module each featuring a tethered sleeping bag a fold-out desk a porthole and storage for personal effects visiting crews had no allocated sleep module instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall us astronauts installed themselves within spektr until a collision with a progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module.17 it was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated otherwise astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.41 food and drinkedit microbiological environmental hazardsedit in the 1990s samples of extremophile molds were taken from mir ninety species of micro-organisms were found in 1990 four years after the station's launch by the time of its decommission in 2001 the number of known different micro-organisms had grown to 140 as space stations get older the problems with contamination get worse.42 moulds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal glass and rubber.43 the moulds in mir were found growing behind panels and inside air-conditioning equipment the moulds also caused bad smell which was often cited as visitors strongest impressions.44 some biologists were concerned about the mutant fungi being a major microbiological hazard for humans and reaching earth in the splashdown after having been in an isolated environment for 15 years.44 station operationsedit expeditionsedit early existenceedit due to the pressure to launch the station on schedule mission planners were left without soyuz spacecraft or modules to launch to the station at first it was decided to launch soyuz t-15 on a dual mission to both mir and salyut 7.15 leonid kizim and vladimir solovyov first docked with mir on 15 march 1986 during their nearly 51-day stay on mir they brought the station online and checked its systems they unloaded two progress spacecraft launched after their arrival progress 25 and progress 26.46 the second expedition to mir eo-2 launched on soyuz tm-2 on 5 february 1987 during their stay the kvant-1 module launched on 30 march 1987 arrived it was the first experimental version of a planned series of '37k modules scheduled to be launched to mir on buran kvant-1 was originally planned to dock with salyut 7 due to technical problems during its development it was reassigned to mir the module carried the first set of six gyroscopes for attitude control the module also carried instruments for x-ray and ultraviolet astrophysical observations.19 the initial rendezvous of the kvant-1 module with mir on 5 april 1987 was troubled by the failure of the onboard control system after the failure of the second attempt to dock the resident cosmonauts yuri romanenko and aleksandr laveykin conducted an eva to fix the problem they found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station which prevented the docking after removing the bag docking was completed on 12 april.4849 third startedit after a 40-day delay caused by faulty computer chips kvant-2 was launched on 26 november 1989 after problems deploying the craft's solar array and with the automated docking systems on both kvant-2 and mir the new module was docked manually on 6 december kvant-2 added a second set of gyrodines to mir and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen reducing dependence on ground resupply the module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch a special backpack unit known as ikar an equivalent of the us manned maneuvering unit was located inside kvant-2's airlock.5051 kristall contained furnaces for use in producing crystals under microgravity conditions hence the choice of name for the module the module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system in addition to equipment for astronomical observations the most obvious features of the module were the two androgynous peripheral attach system apas-89 docking ports designed to be compatible with the buran spacecraft although they were never used in a buran docking they were useful later during the shuttle-mir programme providing a berthing location for us space shuttles.53 post-soviet periodedit the eo-10 crew launched aboard soyuz tm-13 on 2 october 1991 was the last crew to launch from the ussr and continued the occupation of mir through the fall of the soviet union the crew is notable for having launched as soviet citizens and returning to earth as russians the newly formed russian federal space agency roskosmos was unable to finance the unlaunched spektr and priroda modules instead putting them into storage and ending mir's second expansion.545556 the first manned mission flown from an independent kazakhstan was soyuz tm-14 launched on 17 march 1992 which carried the eo-11 crew to mir docking on 19 march before the departure of soyuz tm-13 on 17 june russian president boris yeltsin and us president george h w bush announced what would later become the shuttle-mir programme a cooperative venture which proved useful to the cash-strapped roskosmos and led to the eventual completion and launch of spektr and priroda eo-12 followed in july alongside a brief visit by french astronaut michel tognini.45 the following crew eo-13 began preparations for the shuttle-mir programme by flying to the station in a modified spacecraft soyuz tm-16 launched on 26 january 1993 which was equipped with an apas-89 docking system rather than the usual probe-and-drogue enabling it to dock to kristall and test the port which would later be used by us space shuttles the spacecraft also enabled controllers to obtain data on the dynamics of docking a spacecraft to a space station off the station's longitudinal axis in addition to data on the structural integrity of this configuration via a test called rezonans conducted on 28 january soyuz tm-15 meanwhile departed with the eo-12 crew on 1 february.45 the eo-13 crew departed on 22 july and soon after mir passed through the annual perseid meteor shower during which the station was hit by several particles a spacewalk was conducted on 28 september to inspect the station's hull but no serious damage was reported soyuz tm-18 arrived on 10 january 1994 carrying the eo-15 crew including valeri polyakov who was to remain on mir for 14 months and soyuz tm-17 left on 14 january the undocking was unusual in that the spacecraft was to pass along kristall in order to obtain photographs of the apas to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots due to an error in setting up the control system the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre scratching the exterior of kristall.45 on 3 february 1994 mir veteran sergei krikalev became the first russian cosmonaut to launch on a us spacecraft flying on space shuttle discovery during sts-60.57 the launch of soyuz tm-19 carrying the eo-16 crew was delayed due to the unavailability of a payload fairing for the booster that was to carry it but the spacecraft eventually left earth on 1 july 1994 and docked two days later they stayed only four months to allow the soyuz schedule to line up with the planned space shuttle manifest and so polyakov greeted a second resident crew in october prior to the undocking of soyuz tm-19 when the eo-17 crew arrived in soyuz tm-20.45 lucid's stay aboard mir ended with the flight of atlantis on sts-79 which launched on 16 september this the fourth docking saw john blaha transferring onto mir to take his place as resident us astronaut his stay on the station improved operations in several areas including transfer procedures for a docked space shuttle hand-over procedures for long-duration american crew members and ham amateur radio communications and also saw two spacewalks to reconfigure the station's power grid blaha spent four months with the eo-22 crew before returning to earth aboard atlantis on sts-81 in january 1997 at which point he was replaced by physician jerry linenger.586869 during his flight linenger became the first american to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the russian-built orlan-m spacesuit alongside russian cosmonaut vasili tsibliyev flying eo-23 all three crew members of eo-23 performed a fly-around in soyuz tm-25 spacecraft.17 linenger and his russian crewmates vasili tsibliyev and aleksandr lazutkin faced several difficulties during the mission including the most severe fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft caused by a malfunctioning vika failures of various systems a near collision with progress m-33 during a long-distance toru test and a total loss of station electrical power the power failure also caused a loss of attitude control which led to an uncontrolled tumble through space.17223758 linenger was succeeded by anglo-american astronaut michael foale carried up by atlantis on sts-84 alongside russian mission specialist elena kondakova foale's increment proceeded fairly normally until 25 june when during the second test of the progress manual docking system toru progress m-34 collided with solar arrays on the spektr module and crashed into the module's outer shell puncturing the module and causing depressurisation on the station only quick actions on the part of the crew cutting cables leading to the module and closing spektr's hatch prevented the crews having to abandon the station in soyuz tm-25 their efforts stabilised the station's air pressure whilst the pressure in spektr containing many of foale's experiments and personal effects dropped to a vacuum.2258 in an effort to restore some of the power and systems lost following the isolation of spektr and to attempt to locate the leak eo-24 commander anatoly solovyev and flight engineer pavel vinogradov carried out a risky salvage operation later in the flight entering the empty module during a so-called intra-vehicular activity or iva spacewalk and inspecting the condition of hardware and running cables through a special hatch from spektr's systems to the rest of the station following these first investigations foale and solovyev conducted a 6-hour eva outside spektr to inspect the damage.5870 final days and deorbitedit following the 8 june 1998 departure of discovery the eo-25 crew of budarin and musabayev remained on mir completing materials experiments and compiling a station inventory on 2 july roskosmos director yuri koptev announced that due to a lack of funding to keep mir active the station would be deorbited in june 1999.17 the eo-26 crew of gennady padalka and sergei avdeyev arrived on 15 august in soyuz tm-28 alongside physicist yuri baturin who departed with the eo-25 crew on 25 august in soyuz tm-27 the crew carried out two spacewalks one inside spektr to reseat some power cables and another outside to set up experiments delivered by progress m-40 which also carried a large amount of propellant to begin alterations to mir's orbit in preparation for the station's decommissioning 20 november 1998 saw the launch of zarya the first module of the international space station but delays to the new station's service module zvezda had led to calls for mir to be kept in orbit past 1999 roskosmos confirmed that it would not fund mir past the set deorbit date.17 visiting spacecraftedit mir was primarily supported by the russian soyuz and progress spacecraft and had two ports available for docking them initially the fore and aft ports of the core module could be used for dockings but following the permanent berthing of kvant-1 to the aft port in 1987 the rear port of the new module took on this role from the core module's aft port each port was equipped with the plumbing required for progress cargo ferries to replace the station's fluids and also the guidance systems needed to guide the spacecraft for docking two such systems were used on mir the rear ports of both the core module and kvant-1 were equipped with both the igla and kurs systems whilst the core module's forward port featured only the newer kurs.17 soyuz spacecraft provided manned access to and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station allowing for a relatively quick return to earth in the event of an emergency.4578 two models of soyuz flew to mir soyuz t-15 was the only igla-equipped soyuz-t to visit the station whilst all other flights used the newer kurs-equipped soyuz-tm a total of 31 30 manned 1 unmanned soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.45 in addition to the routine soyuz and progress flights it was anticipated that mir would also be the destination for flights by the soviet buran space shuttle which was intended to deliver extra modules based on the same 37k bus as kvant-1 and provide a much improved cargo return service to the station kristall carried two androgynous peripheral attach system apas-89 docking ports designed to be compatible with the shuttle one port was to be used for buran the other for the planned pulsar x-2 telescope also to be delivered by buran.1753 the cancellation of the buran programme meant these capabilities were not realised until the 1990s when the ports were used instead by us space shuttles as part of the shuttle-mir programme after testing by the specially modified soyuz tm-16 in 1993 initially visiting space shuttle orbiters docked directly to kristall but this required the relocation of the module to ensure sufficient distance between the shuttle and mir's solar arrays.17 to eliminate the need to move the module and retract solar arrays for clearance issues a mir docking module was later added to the end of kristall.80 the shuttles provided crew rotation of the american astronauts on station and carried cargo to and from the station performing some of the largest transfers of cargo of the time with a space shuttle docked to mir the temporary enlargements of living and working areas amounted to a complex that was the largest spacecraft in history at that time with a combined mass of 250 tonnes 280 short tons.17 mission control centreedit unused equipmentedit three command and control modules were constructed for the mir program one was used in space one remained in a moscow warehouse as a source of repair parts if needed83 and the third eventually was sold to an educational/entertainment complex in the us in 1997 tommy bartlett's world  exploratory purchased the unit and had it shipped to wisconsin dells wisconsin where it became the centrepiece of the complex's space exploration wing.84 safety aspectsedit aging systems and atmosphereedit various breakdowns of the elektron oxygen-generating system were a concern they led crews to become increasingly reliant on the backup vika solid-fuel oxygen generator sfog systems which led to a fire during the handover between eo-22 and eo-23.1722 see also iss eclss accidentsedit several accidents occurred which threatened the station's safety such as the glancing collision between kristall and soyuz tm-17 during proximity operations in january 1994 the three most alarming incidents occurred during eo-23 the first was on 23 february 1997 during the handover period from eo-22 to eo-23 when a malfunction occurred in the backup vika system a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator sfog the vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds according to official sources at the tsup astronaut jerry linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes this forced the crew to don respirators but some of the respirator masks initially worn were broken some of the fire extinguishers mounted on the walls of the newer modules were immovable.2237 the other two accidents concerned testing of the station's toru manual docking system to manually dock progress m-33 and progress m-34 the tests were to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive kurs automatic docking system from progress spacecraft due to malfunctioning equipment both tests failed with progress m-33 narrowly missing the station and progress m-34 striking spektr and puncturing the module causing the station to depressurise and leading to spektr being permanently sealed off this in turn led to a power crisis aboard mir as the module's solar arrays produced a large proportion of the station's electrical supply causing the station to power down and begin to drift requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.1722 radiation and orbital debrisedit the increased radiation levels pose a higher risk of crews developing cancer and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes these cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts over time lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members especially in such confined areas radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.38 at the low altitudes at which mir orbited there is a variety of space debris consisting of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites to explosion fragments paint flakes slag from solid rocket motors89 coolant released by rorsat nuclear powered satellites90 small needles and many other objects these objects in addition to natural micrometeoroids91 posed a threat to the station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage to other parts of the station such as the solar arrays.92 micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts as such objects could puncture their spacesuits causing them to depressurise.93 meteor showers in particular posed a risk and during such storms the crews slept in their soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should mir be damaged.17 in mediaedit

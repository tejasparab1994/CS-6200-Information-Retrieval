puerto rico puerto rican formalamerican since 1917 puerto ricoa spanish for rich port officially the commonwealth of puerto rico spanish estado libre asociado de puerto rico lit free associated state of puerto ricob and briefly called porto ricoc161718 is an unincorporated territory of the united states located in the northeast caribbean sea an archipelago among the greater antilles puerto rico includes the main island of puerto rico and a number of smaller ones such as mona culebra and vieques the capital and most populous city is san juan its official languages are spanish and english though spanish predominates.19 the island's population is approximately 3.4 million puerto rico's history tropical climate natural scenery traditional cuisine and tax incentives make it a destination for travelers from around the world puerto ricans are by law natural-born citizens of the united states and may move freely between the island and the mainland.23 as it is not a state puerto rico does not have a vote in the united states congress which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the puerto rico federal relations act of 1950 as a u.s territory american citizens residing on the island are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for president and vice president of the united states24 and do not pay federal income tax on puerto rican income congress approved a local constitution allowing u.s citizens on the territory to elect a governor a 2012 referendum showed a majority 54 of those who voted disagreed with the present form of territorial status a second question asking about a new model had full statehood the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status although a significant number of people did not answer the second question of the referendum.25 another fifth referendum was held on june 11 2017 with statehood and independence/free association initially as the only available choices at the recommendation of the department of justice an option for the current territorial status was added.26 the referendum showed an overwhelming support for statehood with 97.18 voting for it although the voter turnout had a historically low figure of only 22.99 of the registered voters casting their ballots in early 2017 the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government the outstanding bond debt had climbed to $70 billion at a time with 12.4 unemployment the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession.27 this was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the great depression when the u.s government in 1935 provided relief efforts through the puerto rico reconstruction administration.28 on may 3 2017 puerto rico's financial oversight board in the u.s district court for puerto rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under title iii of promesa.29 by early august 2017 the debt was $72 billion with a 45 poverty rate.30 in late september 2017 the category 5 hurricane maria hit puerto rico causing devastating damage.31 the island's electrical grid was largely destroyed with repairs expected to take months to complete provoking the largest power outage in american history.32 contents etymology columbus named the island san juan bautista in honor of saint john the baptist while the capital city was named ciudad de puerto rico rich port city eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico while san juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city.d the official name of the entity in spanish is estado libre asociado de puerto rico free associated state of puerto rico while its official english name is commonwealth of puerto rico history pre-columbian era the first known settlers were the ortoiroid people an archaic period culture of amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the south american mainland some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4000 years.41 an archeological dig in 1990 on the island of vieques found the remains of a man designated as the puerto ferro man which was dated to around 2000 bc.42 the ortoiroid were displaced by the saladoid a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 bc.41 conquest and early settlement colonization the habsburgs late colonial period minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years with the revolt planned and organized by marcos xiorro in 1821 being the most important even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of puerto rico's folklore.57 politics of liberalism free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the spanish crown and allegiance to the roman catholic church.59 the offer was very successful and european immigration continued even after 1898 puerto rico still receives spanish and european immigration leaders of el grito de lares went into exile in new york city many joined the puerto rican revolutionary committee founded on december 8 1895 and continued their quest for puerto rican independence in 1897 antonio mattei lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in yauco organized another uprising which became known as the intentona de yauco they raised what they called the puerto rican flag which was adopted as the national flag the local conservative political factions opposed independence rumors of the planned event spread to the local spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to spanish colonial rule.61 in 1890 captain alfred thayer mahan a member of the navy war board and leading u.s strategic thinker published a book titled the influence of sea power upon history in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the british royal navy part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the caribbean which would serve as coaling and naval stations they would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the isthmus of panama to allow easier passage of ships between the atlantic and pacific oceans.66 william h seward the former secretary of state under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson had also stressed the importance of building a canal in honduras nicaragua or panama he suggested that the united states annex the dominican republic and purchase puerto rico and cuba the u.s senate did not approve his annexation proposal and spain rejected the u.s offer of 160 million dollars for puerto rico and cuba.66 since 1894 the united states naval war college had been developing contingency plans for a war with spain by 1896 the u.s office of naval intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in puerto rican waters except for one 1895 plan which recommended annexation of the island then named isle of pines later renamed as isla de la juventud a recommendation dropped in later planning plans developed for attacks on spanish territories were intended as support operations against spain's forces in and around cuba.67 recent research suggests that the u.s did consider puerto rico valuable as a naval station and recognized that it and cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar  a valuable commercial commodity which the united states lacked68 before the development of the sugar beet industry in the united states the united states and puerto rico began a long-standing metropolis-colony relationship.70 in the early 20th century puerto rico was ruled by the military with officials including the governor appointed by the president of the united states the foraker act of 1900 gave puerto rico a certain amount of civilian popular government including a popularly elected house of representatives the upper house and governor were appointed by the united states its judicial system was constructed to follow the american legal system a puerto rico supreme court and a united state district court for the territory were established it was authorized a non-voting member of congress by the title of resident commissioner who was appointed in addition this act extended all u.s laws not locally inapplicable to puerto rico specifying in particular exemption from u.s internal revenue laws.71 the act empowered the civil government to legislate on all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in puerto rico though the u.s congress retained the power to annul acts of the puerto rico legislature.7172 during an address to the puerto rican legislature in 1906 president theodore roosevelt recommended that puerto ricans become u.s citizens.7173 in 1914 the puerto rican house of delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the united states but this was rejected by the u.s congress as unconstitutional and in violation of the 1900 foraker act.74 the same act provided for a popularly elected senate to complete a bicameral legislative assembly as well as a bill of rights it authorized the popular election of the resident commissioner to a four-year term natural disasters including a major earthquake and tsunami in 1918 and several hurricanes and the great depression impoverished the island during the first few decades under u.s rule.76 some political leaders such as pedro albizu campos who led the puerto rican nationalist party demanded change in relations with the united states he organized a protest at the university of puerto rico in 1935 in which four were killed by police in 1937 albizu campos party organized a protest in which numerous people were killed by police in ponce the insular police resembling the national guard opened fire upon unarmed78 cadets and bystanders alike.78 the attack on unarmed protesters was reported by the u.s congressman vito marcantonio and confirmed by the report of the hays commission which investigated the events the commission was led by arthur garfield hays counsel to the american civil liberties union.78 nineteen people were killed and over 200 were badly wounded many in their backs while running away.7980 the hays commission declared it a massacre and police mob action79 and it has since been known as the ponce massacre in the aftermath on april 2 1943 tydings introduced a bill in congress calling for independence for puerto rico this bill ultimately was defeated.71 in accordance with this law it would be a crime to print publish sell exhibit organize or help anyone organize any society group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison be fined $10000 u.s. or both according to dr leopoldo figueroa a member of the puerto rico house of representatives the law was repressive and in violation of the first amendment of the u.s constitution which guarantees freedom of speech he asserted that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of puerto rico the law was repealed in 1957.84 estado libre asociado in 1950 the u.s congress granted puerto ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference yes or no on a proposed u.s law that would organize puerto rico as a commonwealth that would continue united states sovereignty over puerto rico and its people puerto rico's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution the constitution of puerto rico was formally adopted on july 3 1952 the constitutional convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known on february 4 1952 the convention approved resolution 22 which chose in english the word commonwealth meaning a politically organized community or state which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system puerto rico officially designates itself with the term commonwealth of puerto rico in its constitution as a translation into english of the term to estado libre asociado ela in 1967 puerto rico's legislative assembly polled the political preferences of the puerto rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of puerto rico this constituted the first plebiscite by the legislature for a choice among three status options commonwealth statehood and independence in subsequent plebiscites organized by puerto rico held in 1993 and 1998 without any formal commitment on the part of the u.s government to honor the results the current political status failed to receive majority support in 1993 commonwealth status won by a plurality of votes 48.6 versus 46.3 for statehood while the none of the above option which was the popular democratic party-sponsored choice won in 1998 with 50.3 of the votes versus 46.5 for statehood disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives and commonwealth advocates among others reportedly urged a vote for none of the above.858687 in 1950 the u.s congress approved public law 600 p.l 81-600 which allowed for a democratic referendum in puerto rico to determine whether puerto ricans desired to draft their own local constitution.88 this act was meant to be adopted in the nature of a compact it required congressional approval of the puerto rico constitution before it could go into effect and repealed certain sections of the organic act of 1917 the sections of this statute left in force were entitled the puerto rican federal relations act.8990 u.s secretary of the interior oscar l chapman under whose department resided responsibility of puerto rican affairs clarified the new commonwealth status in this manner on october 30 1950 pedro albizu campos and other nationalists led a three-day revolt against the united states in various cities and towns of puerto rico in what is known as the puerto rican nationalist party revolts of the 1950s the most notable occurred in jayuya and utuado in the jayuya revolt known as the jayuya uprising the puerto rican governor declared martial law and attacked the insurgents in jayuya with infantry artillery and bombers under control of the puerto rican commander the utuado uprising culminated in what is known as the utuado massacre on november 1 1950 puerto rican nationalists from new york city griselio torresola and oscar collazo attempted to assassinate president harry s truman at his temporary residence of blair house torresola was killed during the attack but collazo was wounded and captured he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death but president truman commuted his sentence to life after collazo served 29 years in a federal prison president jimmy carter commuted his sentence to times served and he was released in 1979 pedro albizu campos served many years in a federal prison in atlanta for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the u.s government in puerto rico.93 puerto rico adopted the name of estado libre asociado de puerto rico literally associated free state of puerto rico94 officially translated into english as commonwealth for its body politic.m9596 the united states congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of puerto rican life including citizenship the currency the postal service foreign policy military defense communications labor relations the environment commerce finance health and welfare and many others.97 referendums on statehood or independence four referendums have been held since the late 20th century to resolve the political status the 2012 referendum showed a majority 54 of the voters in favor of a change in status with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a change because there were almost 500000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum creating confusion as to the voters true desire congress decided to ignore the vote.99100 if the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities.105 the agreement might cover topics such as the role of the u.s military in puerto rico the use of the u.s currency free trade between the two entities and whether puerto ricans would be u.s citizens.106 the three current free associated states marshall islands micronesia and palau use the american dollar receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country their citizens are allowed to work in the u.s and serve in its military.105 statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection according to the government development bank this might be the only solution to the debt crisis congress has the power to vote to allow chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood but in late 2015 there was very little support in the house for this concept other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and medicaid funding the right to vote in presidential elections and the higher federal minimum wage.109 subsequent to the 2017 referendum puerto rico's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal congress.110111 in spite of the outcome of the referendum and the so-called tennessee plan above action by the united states congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of puerto rico under the territorial clause of the united states constitution.108 united nations special committee on decolonization since 1953 the un has been considering the political status of puerto rico and how to assist it in achieving independence or decolonization in 1978 the special committee determined that a colonial relationship existed between the u.s and puerto rico.112 the un's special committee on decolonization has often referred to puerto rico as a nation in its reports because internationally the people of puerto rico are often considered to be a caribbean nation with their own national identity.113114115 most recently in a june 2016 report the special committee called for the united states to expedite the process to allow self-determination in puerto rico more specifically the group called on the united states to expedite a process that would allow the people of puerto rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence .. allow the puerto rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner and to address their urgent economic and social needs including unemployment marginalization insolvency and poverty.116 international status on november 27 1953 shortly after the establishment of the commonwealth the general assembly of the united nations approved resolution 748 removing puerto rico's classification as a non-self-governing territory the general assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of puerto rico.117118 according to the white house task force on puerto rico's political status in its december 21 2007 report the u.s. in its written submission to the un in 1953 never represented that congress could not change its relationship with puerto rico without the territory's consent.119 it stated that the u.s justice department in 1959 reiterated that congress held power over puerto rico pursuant to the territorial clause120 of the u.s constitution.119 in 1993 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice.121 in a 1996 report on a puerto rico status political bill the u.s house committee on resources stated puerto rico's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under resolution 1541 the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as 1 national independence 2 free association based on separate sovereignty or 3 full integration with another nation on the basis of equality the report concluded that puerto rico .. remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of 'free association with the united states as that status is defined under united states law or international practice that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the u.s congress and that u.s congress can also withdraw the u.s citizenship of puerto rican residents of puerto rico at any time for a legitimate federal purpose.122123 the application of the u.s constitution to puerto rico is limited by the insular cases in 2006124 2007125 2009126 2010127 and 2011128 the united nations special committee on decolonization passed resolutions calling on the united states to expedite a process that would allow puerto ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence129 and to release all puerto rican political prisoners in u.s prisons to clean up decontaminate and return the lands in the islands of vieques and culebra to the people of puerto rico to perform a probe into u.s human rights violations on the island and a probe into the killing by the fbi of pro-independence leader filiberto ojeda rios 21st century on july 15 2009 the united nations special committee on decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the government of the united states to expedite a process that would allow the puerto rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.131 immediately following u.s house passage h.r 2499 was sent to the u.s senate where it was given two formal readings and referred to the senate committee on energy and natural resources on december 22 2010 the 111th united states congress adjourned without any senate vote on h.r.2499 killing the bill.134 the latest task force report was released on march 11 2011 the report suggested a two-plebiscite process including a first plebiscite that requires the people of puerto rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the united states either via statehood or commonwealth or wish to be independent via independence or free association if continuing to be part of the united states were chosen in the first plebiscite a second vote would be taken between statehood and commonwealth.135 on june 14 2011 president barack obama promised to support 'a clear decision by the people of puerto rico on statehood.136 that same month the united nations special committee on decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by cuba's delegate on june 20 2011 calling on the united states to expedite a process that would allow puerto ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.129 on november 6 2012 a two-question referendum took place simultaneous with the general elections.137137138 the first question asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the u.s constitution the second question posed three alternate status options if the first question was approved statehood independence or free association.139 for the first question 54 percent voted against the current commonwealth status for the second question 61.16 voted for statehood 33.34 for a sovereign free associated state and 5.49 for independence.140 there were also 515348 blank and invalidated ballots which are not reflected in the final tally as they are not considered cast votes under puerto rico law.130 on december 11 2012 puerto rico's legislature passed a concurrent resolution to request to the president and the u.s congress action on november 6 2012 plebiscite results.141 but on april 10 2013 with the issue still being widely debated the white house announced that it will seek $2.5 million to hold another referendum this next one being the first puerto rican status referendum to be financed by the u.s federal government.142 in december 2015 the u.s government submitted a brief as amicus curiae to the u.s supreme court related to the case commonwealth of puerto rico v sanchez valle the u.s government official position is that the u.s constitution does not contemplate sovereign territories that the court has consistently recognized that there is no sovereignty in a territory of the united states but that of the united states itself and a u.s territory has no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state that is because the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the united states congress's plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self-government whereby local officials administer a territory's internal affairs.143 on june 30 2016 the president of the united states of america signed a new law approved by u.s congress h.r 5278 promesa establishing a control board over the puerto rico government this board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations in particular the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government's constitutional power to make all needful rules and regulations regarding u.s territories the president would appoint all seven voting members of the board and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by puerto rico's legislature governor and other public authorities.145 political status the latest referendum on statehood independence or an associated republic was held on november 6 2012 the people of puerto rico made history by requesting for the first time ever the conclusion of the island's current territorial status almost 78 of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve puerto rico's status and a slim but clear majority 54% disagreed with puerto rico maintaining its present territorial status furthermore among the possible alternatives sixty-one percent 61% of voters chose the statehood option while one third of the ballots were submitted blank.146147 on december 11 2012 the legislative assembly of puerto rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the president and the congress of the united states to respond to the referendum of the people of puerto rico held on november 6 2012 to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit puerto rico as a state.105 the initiative has not made puerto rico into a state in may 2017 the natural resources defense council reported that puerto rico's water system was the worst as measured by the clean water act 70 of the population drank water that violated u.s law.148 geography puerto rico consists of the main island of puerto rico and various smaller islands including vieques culebra mona desecheo and caja de muertos of these five only culebra and vieques are inhabited year-round mona which has played a key role in maritime history is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the puerto rico department of natural resources.149 there are many other even smaller islets like monito which is near to mona150 isla de cabras and la isleta de san juan both located on the san juan bay the latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like old san juan and puerta de tierra and connected to the main island by bridges.151152 puerto rico has 17 lakes all man-made and more than 50 rivers most originating in the cordillera central.158 rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions puerto rico is composed of cretaceous to eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks overlain by younger oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks.159 most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates the oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old jurassic and are located at sierra bermeja in the southwest part of the island they may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the pacific ocean realm puerto rico lies at the boundary between the caribbean and north american plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction these stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis these seismic events along with landslides represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern caribbean the most recent major earthquake occurred on october 11 1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the richter scale.160 it originated off the coast of aguadilla several kilometers off the northern coast and was accompanied by a tsunami it caused extensive property damage and widespread losses damaging infrastructure especially bridges it resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage the failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the puerto rican nationalist party climate biodiversity demographics the population of puerto rico has been shaped by amerindian settlement european colonization slavery economic migration and puerto rico's status as unincorporated territory of the united states population makeup the estimated population of puerto rico as of july 1 2015 was 3474182 a 6.75 decrease since the 2010 united states census.177 from 2000 to 2010 the population decreased the first such decrease in census history for puerto rico it went from the 3808610 residents registered in the 2000 census to 3725789 in the 2010 census.178 a declining and aging population presents additional problems for the society the u.s census bureau's estimate for july 1 2016 was 3411307 people down substantially from the 2010 data which had indicated 3725789 people.179 continuous european immigration and high natural increase helped the population of puerto rico grow from 155426 in 1800 to almost a million by the close of the 19th century a census conducted by royal decree on september 30 1858 gave the following totals of the puerto rican population at that time 341015 were free colored 300430 identified as whites and 41736 were slaves.180 during the 19th century hundreds of families arrived in puerto rico primarily from the canary islands and andalusia but also from other parts of spain such as catalonia asturias galicia and the balearic islands and numerous spanish loyalists from spain's former colonies in south america settlers from outside spain also arrived in the islands including from corsica france lebanon china portugal ireland scotland germany and italy this immigration from non-hispanic countries was the result of the real cedula de gracias de 1815 royal decree of graces of 1815 which allowed european catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island provided they paid taxes and continued to support the catholic church between 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in puerto rico did not ask about race or ethnicity the 2000 united states census included a racial self-identification question in puerto rico according to the census most puerto ricans identified as white and hispanic few identified as black or some other race population genetics a recent population genetics study conducted in puerto rico suggests that between 52.6 and 84 of the population possess some degree of amerindian mitochondrial dna mtdna in their maternal ancestry usually in a combination with other ancestries such as aboriginal guanche north-west african ancestry brought by spanish settlers from the canary islands.182 one genetic study on the racial makeup of puerto ricans including all races found them to be roughly around 61 west eurasian/north african overwhelmingly of spanish provenance 27 sub-saharan african and 11 native american.187 another genetic study from 2007 claimed that the average genomewide individual ie puerto rican ancestry proportions have been estimated as 66% 18% and 16% for european west african and native american respectively.188 other study estimates 63.7 european 21.2 sub-saharan african and 15.2 native american european ancestry is more prevalent in the west and in central puerto rico african in eastern puerto rico and native american in northern puerto rico.189 a pew research survey indicated a literacy rate of 90.4 adult population in 2012 based on data from the united nations and a life expectancy of 79.3 years.190 immigration and emigration puerto rico has recentlywhen? become the permanent home of over 100000 legal residents the vast majority of recent immigrants both legal and illegal come from the dominican republic and haiti.191192193194195 other sources sending in significant numbers of recent immigrants include cuba mexico colombia panama jamaica venezuela spain and nigeria.196197 also there are many non-puerto rican u.s citizens settling in puerto rico from the mainland united states and the u.s virgin islands as well as nuyoricans stateside puerto ricans coming back to puerto rico.198 most recent immigrants settle in and around san juan based on the july 1 2016 estimate by the u.s census bureau the population of the commonwealth had declined by 314482 people since the 2010 census data had been tabulated.179 population distribution languages the official languages203 of the executive branch of government of puerto rico204 are spanish and english with spanish being the primary language spanish is and has been the only official language of the entire commonwealth judiciary system despite a 1902 english-only language law.205 all official business of the u.s district court for the district of puerto rico is conducted in english english is the primary language of less than 10 of the population spanish is the dominant language of business education and daily life on the island spoken by nearly 95 of the population.206 the u.s census bureau's 2015 update provides the following facts:207 94.1 of adults speak spanish 5.8 speak only english 78.3 do not speak english very well in puerto rico public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in spanish there have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in english only objections from teaching staff are common perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in english.208 english is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school the languages of the deaf community are american sign language and its local variant puerto rican sign language religion religious affiliation 2014210211 pollster pablo ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 roman catholic 28 pentecostal and 18 were members of independent churches which would give a protestant percentage of 46 if the last two populations are combined protestants collectively added up to almost two million people another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of protestants the data provided for 2014 by pew research center190 is summarized in the chart to the right an associated press article in march 2014 stated that more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as catholic but provided no source for this information.217 the cia world factbook reports that 85 of the population of puerto rico identifies as roman catholic while 15 identify as protestant and other neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent.218 a 2013 pew research survey found that only about 45 of puerto rican adults identified themselves as catholic 29 as protestant and 20 as unaffiliated with a religion the people surveyed by pew consisted of puerto ricans living in the 50 states and dc and may not be indicative of those living in the commonwealth.219 by 2014 a pew research report with the sub-title widespread change in a historically catholic region indicated that only 56 of puerto ricans were catholic and that 33 were protestant this survey was completed between october 2013 and february 2014.220 roman catholic cathedral of san juan bautista islamic center at ponce inside sha'are zedeck in san juan

citation given while residing in puerto rico puerto ricans cannot vote in u.s presidential elections but they can vote in primaries puerto ricans who become residents of a u.s state can vote in presidential elections political parties and elections since 1952 puerto rico has had three main political parties the popular democratic party ppd in spanish the new progressive party pnp in spanish and the puerto rican independence party pip the three parties stand for different political status the ppd for example seeks to maintain the island's status with the u.s as a commonwealth while the pnp on the other hand seeks to make puerto rico a state of the united states the pip in contrast seeks a complete separation from the united states by seeking to make puerto rico a sovereign nation in terms of party strength the ppd and pnp usually hold about 47 of the vote each while the pip holds only about 5% other non-registered parties include the puerto rican nationalist party the socialist workers movement and the hostosian national independence movement law the insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems puerto rico is the only current u.s possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than american english namely spanish because the u.s federal government operates primarily in english all puerto rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in english in u.s federal courts and litigate federal preemption issues in puerto rican courts title 48 of the united states code outlines the role of the united states code to united states territories and insular areas such as puerto rico after the u.s government assumed control of puerto rico in 1901 it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law criminal procedure and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in california although puerto rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the california penal code the judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court which is the only appellate court required by the constitution all other courts are created by the legislative assembly of puerto rico there is also a federal district court for puerto rico someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a commonwealth court unlike a state court since puerto rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from congress as a state does.243 such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy political status the nature of puerto rico's political relationship with the u.s is the subject of ongoing debate in puerto rico the united states congress and the united nations.244 specifically the basic question is whether puerto rico should remain a u.s territory become a u.s state or become an independent country.245 within the united states constitutionally puerto rico is subject to the plenary powers of the united states congress under the territorial clause of article iv of the u.s constitution.246 laws enacted at the federal level in the united states apply to puerto rico as well regardless of its political status their residents do not have voting representation in the u.s congress like the different states of the united states puerto rico lacks the full sovereignty of an independent nation for example the power to manage its external relations with other nations which is held by the u.s federal government the supreme court of the united states has indicated that once the u.s constitution has been extended to an area by congress or the courts its coverage is irrevocable to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say what the law is.247 puerto ricans were collectively made u.s citizens in 1917 as a result of the jones-shafroth act.248 u.s citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for the u.s president though both major parties republican and democratic run primary elections in puerto rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate since puerto rico is an unincorporated territory see above and not a u.s state the united states constitution does not fully enfranchise u.s citizens residing in puerto rico.236249 only fundamental rights under the american federal constitution and adjudications are applied to puerto ricans various other u.s supreme court decisions have held which rights apply in puerto rico and which ones do not puerto ricans have a long history of service in the u.s armed forces and since 1917 they have been included in the u.s compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect though the commonwealth government has its own tax laws puerto ricans are also required to pay many kinds of u.s federal taxes not including the federal personal income tax for puerto rico-sourced income but only under certain circumstances.250251252253254255256257 in 2009 puerto rico paid $3.742 billion into the u.s treasury.258 residents of puerto rico pay into social security and are thus eligible for social security benefits upon retirement they are excluded from the supplemental security income ssi and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a u.s state.259 also medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the system.260 while a state may try an individual for the same crime he/she was tried in federal court this is not the case in puerto rico being a u.s territory puerto rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states thus such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.243 in 1992 president george h w bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the commonwealth of puerto rico this memorandum directs all federal departments agencies and officials to treat puerto rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in puerto rico just as in any state including the federal bureau of investigation federal emergency management agency transportation security administration social security administration and others while puerto rico has its own commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a u.s state there is also a u.s federal district court in puerto rico and puerto ricans have served as judges in that court and in other federal courts on the u.s mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment sonia sotomayor a new yorker of puerto rican descent serves as an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states puerto ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions including serving as united states ambassadors to other nations foreign and intergovernmental relations it has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries all spanish-speaking and within the united states itself which now include spain the dominican republic panama colombia washington d.c. new york city and florida and has included in the past offices in chile costa rica and mexico such agreements require permission from the u.s department of state most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the united states and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by puerto rico and different u.s states at the local level puerto rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the department of state of puerto rico an executive department headed by the secretary of state of puerto rico who also serves as the territory's lieutenant governor it is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in puerto rico the puerto rico federal affairs administration along with the office of the resident commissioner manage all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the united states including the federal government of the united states local and state governments of the united states and public or private entities in the united states the resident commissioner of puerto rico the delegate elected by puerto ricans to represent them before the federal government including the u.s congress sits in the united states house of representatives serves and votes on congressional committees and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the house floor also engages in foreign affairs to the same extent as other members of congress the current resident commissioner is pedro pierluisi from the new progressive party and member of the democratic party of the united states many puerto ricans have served as united states ambassadors to different nations and international organizations such as the organization of american states mostly but not exclusively in latin america for example maricarmen aponte a puerto rican and now an acting assistant secretary of state previously served as u.s ambassador to el salvador.263 military as it is a territory of the united states of america the defense of puerto rico is provided by the united states as part of the treaty of paris with the president of the united states as its commander-in-chief puerto rico has its own puerto rico national guard and its own state defense force the puerto rico state guard which by local law is under the authority of the puerto rico national guard the commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of puerto rico who delegates his authority to the puerto rico adjutant general currently colonel marta carcana the adjutant general in turn delegates the authority over the state guard to another officer but retains the authority over the puerto rico national guard as a whole u.s military installations in puerto rico were part of the u.s atlantic command lantcom after 1993 usacom which had authority over all u.s military operations that took place throughout the atlantic puerto rico had been seen as crucial in supporting lantcom's mission until 1999 when u.s atlantic command was renamed and given a new mission as united states joint forces command puerto rico is currently under the responsibility of united states northern command both the naval forces caribbean nfc and the fleet air caribbean fair were formerly based at the roosevelt roads naval station the nfc had authority over all u.s naval activity in the waters of the caribbean while fair had authority over all u.s military flights and air operations over the caribbean with the closing of the roosevelt roads and vieques island training facilities the u.s navy has basically exited from puerto rico except for the ships that steam by and the only significant military presence in the island is the u.s army at ft buchanan the puerto rican army and air national guards and the u.s coast guard protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base this resulted in a loss of 6000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million.264 a branch of the u.s army national guard is stationed in puerto rico  known as the puerto rico army national guard  which performs missions equivalent to those of the army national guards of the different states of the united states including ground defense disaster relief and control of civil unrest the local national guard also incorporates a branch of the u.s air national guard  known as the puerto rico air national guard  which performs missions equivalent to those of the air national guards of each one of the u.s states a significant number of puerto ricans participate as members and work for the u.s armed services largely as national guard members and civilian employees the size of the overall military-related community in puerto rico is estimated to be 100000 individuals this includes retired personnel.266 fort buchanan has about 4000 military and civilian personnel in addition approximately 17000 people are members of the puerto rico army and air national guards or the u.s reserve forces.269 puerto rican soldiers have served in every u.s military conflict from world war i to the current military engagement known by the united states and its allies as the war against terrorism administrative divisions there are no counties as there are in the 50 united states there are 78 municipalities municipalities are subdivided into barrios and those into sectors each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected to four-year terms economy the economy of puerto rico is classified as a high income economy by the world bank and as the most competitive economy in latin america by the world economic forum but puerto rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion equivalent to 103 of gnp and a government deficit of $2.5 billion.270271 according to world bank gross national income per capita of puerto rico in 2013 is $23830 ppp international dollars ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world.272 its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing primarily pharmaceuticals textiles petrochemicals and electronics followed by the service industry primarily finance insurance real estate and tourism.no in recent years the territory has also become a popular destination for mice meetings incentives conferencing exhibitions with a modern convention centre district overlooking the port of san juan.274 the geography of puerto rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity primarily due to its relatively small size as an island its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materialscitation needed and consequently its dependence on imports as well as its territorial status with the united states which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions particularly in its shipping industry puerto rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth and entered into recession again in 2013 following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the irs section 936 corporate incentives that the u.s internal revenue code had applied to puerto rico this irs section was critical to the economy as it established tax exemptions for u.s corporations that settled in puerto rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income puerto rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 of the rest of the world.275 academically most of puerto rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired have been repealed or no longer apply to puerto rico its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history;p its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power;q as well as its highly inefficient local governmentrs which has accrued a public debt equal to 68 of its gross domestic product throughout time.tu in comparison to the different states of the united states puerto rico is poorer than mississippi the poorest state of the u.s. with 41 of its population below the poverty line.v when compared to latin america puerto rico has the highest gdp per capita in the region its main trading partners are the united states itself ireland and japan with most products coming from east asia mainly from china hong kong and taiwan at a global scale puerto rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials makes puerto rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate puerto rico's agricultural sector represents less than 1 of gnp.282 heavy debt load in early 2017 the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 unemployment that is more than twice the mainland u.s average.283 the debt had been increasing during a decade long recession.27 in early august 2017 the island's financial oversight board created by promesa planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees down from the original plan of four days per month the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings governor rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.30288 public finances puerto rico has an operating budget of about u.s.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion creating a structural deficit of $775 million about 7.9 of the budget.289 the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000 throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto rico's treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973.w291 for practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects a general budget which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the department of treasury of puerto rico and the consolidated budget which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by puerto rico's government-owned corporations by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the federal government of the united states and by other funds both budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget currently $29b and $9.0b respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from u.s federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31 of the consolidated budget the critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7 of the consolidated budget a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self-sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in fy2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3b with the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prhta reporting losses of $409m the puerto rico electric power authority prepa the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island reporting losses of $272m while the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority prasa the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island reported losses of $112m.293 in terms of protocol the governor together with the puerto rico office of management and budget ogp in spanish formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1 the date established by law as the beginning of puerto rico's fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted at the beginning of each regular session the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a joint resolution and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor's approval or approve it without the governor's consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamber.297 once approved the department of treasury disburses funds to the office of management and budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies all while the puerto rico government development bank the government's intergovernmental bank manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government-owned corporations cost of living the cost of living in puerto rico is high and has increased over the past decade.y298299300301302303304 san juan's in particular is higher than atlanta dallas and seattle but lower than boston chicago and new york city.305 one factor is housing prices which are comparable to miami and los angeles although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the united states.z statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs such as the high cost of electricity which has hovered in the 24 to 30 range per kilowatt/hour two to three times the national average increased travel costs for longer flights additional shipping fees and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the continental united states while some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to puerto rico many merchants exclude hawaii alaska puerto rico and other united states territories the household median income is stated as $19350 and the mean income as $30463 in the u.s census bureau's 2015 update the report also indicates that 45.5 of individuals are below the poverty level.307 the median home value in puerto rico ranges from u.s.$100000 to u.s.$214000 while the national median home value sits at $119600.aa one of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in puerto rico is the merchant marine act of 1920 also known as the jones act which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american ports a practice known as cabotage.309 because of the jones act foreign ships inbound with goods from central and south america western europe and africa cannot stop in puerto rico offload puerto rico-bound goods load mainland-bound puerto rico-manufactured goods and continue to u.s ports instead they must proceed directly to u.s ports where distributors break bulk and send puerto rico-bound manufactured goods to puerto rico across the ocean by u.s.-flagged ships.309 the local government of puerto rico has requested several times to the u.s congress to exclude puerto rico from the jones act restrictions without success.ab the most recent measure has been taken by the 17th legislative assembly of puerto rico through r conc del s 21.311312 these measures have always received support from all the major local political parties education instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18 as of 2010update there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.317 public health and safety as of 2015update medical care in puerto rico had been heavily impacted by emigration of doctors to the mainland and underfunding of the medicare and medicaid programs which serve 60 of the island's population affordable medical insurance under the affordable care act is not available in puerto rico as since puerto ricans pay no income tax no subsidies are available.318 the city of san juan has a system of triage hospital and preventive care health services the municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled the city of san juan operates nine other hospitals of these eight are diagnostic and treatment centers located in communities throughout san juan these nine hospitals are there are also ten private hospitals in san juan these are on the island of culebra there is a small hospital in the island called hospital de culebra it also offers pharmacy services to residents and visitors for emergencies patients are transported by plane to fajardo on the main island.326 the town of caguas has three hospitals hospital hima san pablo menonita caguas regional hospital and the san juan bautista medical center the town of cayey is served by the hospital menonita de cayey and the hospital municipal de cayey reforma de salud de puerto rico puerto rico health reform  locally referred to as la reforma the reform  is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished by means of contracting private health insurance companies rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers the reform is administered by the puerto rico health insurance administration.327 crime the overall rate of crime is low in puerto rico the territory has a high firearm homicide rate the homicide rate of 19.2 per 100000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any u.s state in 2014.328329 most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80 of homicides in puerto rico being drug related.330 culture modern puerto rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents including people european predominantly spanish italian french german and irish african and more recently some north american and lots of south americans a large number of cubans and dominican have relocated to the island in the past few decades from the spanish puerto rico received the spanish language the catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions the united states added english-language influence the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices on march 12 1903 the university of puerto rico was officially founded branching out from the escuela normal industrial a smaller organization that was founded in fajardo three years before much of puerto rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms early in the history of puerto rican music the influences of spanish and african traditions were most noticeable the cultural movements across the caribbean and north america have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached puerto rico.331332 architecture the architecture of puerto rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of spanish rule and a century of american rule spanish colonial architecture ibero-islamic art deco post-modern and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island from town to town there are also many regional distinctions during the 1940s sections of old san juan fell into disrepair and many renovation plans were suggested there was even a strong push to develop old san juan as a small manhattan strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial spanish architectural themes of the old city when a project proposal suggested that the old carmelite convent in san juan be demolished to erect a new hotel the institute had the building declared as a historic building and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility this was what became the hotel el convento in old san juan the paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the americas particularly havana lima and cartagena de indias ponce creole is an architectural style created in ponce puerto rico in the late 19th and early 20th centuries this style of puerto rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920 ponce creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of the french the spaniards and the caribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern puerto rico's caribbean sea coast.333 it is a blend of wood and masonry incorporating architectural elements of other styles from classical revival and spanish revival to victorian.334 arts puerto rican art reflects many influences much from its ethnically diverse background a form of folk art called santos evolved from the catholic church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous puerto ricans to christianity santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood clay and stone after shaping simple they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors santos vary in size with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall traditionally santos were seen as messengers between the earth and heaven as such they occupied a special place on household altars where people prayed to them asked for help or tried to summon their protection literature puerto rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status written works by the native islanders of puerto rico were prohibited and repressed by the spanish colonial government only those who were commissioned by the spanish crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write media the media in puerto rico includes local radio stations television stations and newspapers the majority of which are conducted in spanish there are also three

provide local content in the island these include wipr-tv telemundo univision puerto rico wapa-tv and wkaq-tv music the music of puerto rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources the most conspicuous musical sources have been spain and west africa although many aspects of puerto rican music reflect origins elsewhere in europe and the caribbean and over the last century from the u.s puerto rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres ranging from indigenous genres like bomba plena aguinaldo danza and salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton puerto rico has some national instruments like the cuatro spanish for four the cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the jibaro or people from the mountains originally the cuatro consisted of four steel strings hence its name but currently the cuatro consists of five double steel strings it is easily confused with a guitar even by locals when held upright from right to left the strings are g d a e b with respect to opera the legendary puerto rican tenor antonio paoli was so celebrated that he performed private recitals for pope pius x and the czar nicholas ii of russia in 1907 paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera  when he participated in a performance of pagliacci by ruggiero leoncavallo in milan italy cuisine

annexed by britain as part of the bahamas.17 the processing of sea salt was developed as a highly important export product from the west indies with the labour done by african slaves salt continued to be a major export product into the nineteenth century in 1807 britain prohibited the slave trade and in 1833 abolished slavery in its colonies british ships sometimes intercepted slave traders in the caribbean and some ships were wrecked off the coast of these islands in 1837 the esperanza a portuguese slaver was wrecked off east caicos one of the larger islands while the crew and 220 captive africans survived the shipwreck 18 africans died before the survivors were taken to nassau africans from this ship may have been among the 189 liberated africans whom the british colonists settled in

and taken to cuba for prosecution.19 an 1878 letter documents the trouvadore africans and their descendants as constituting an essential part of the labouring population on the islands.18 in 2004 marine archaeologists affiliated with the turks and caicos national museum discovered a wreck called the black rock ship that subsequent research has suggested may be that of the trouvadore in november 2008 a cooperative marine archaeology expedition funded by the united states noaa confirmed that the wreck has artefacts whose style and date of manufacture link them to the trouvadore.192021

in the country's leadership waned in 1980 the pdm agreed with the british government that independence would be granted in 1982 if the pdm was re-elected in the elections of that year.citation needed

michael misick reaffirmed that his party saw independence from britain as the ultimate goal for the islands but not at the present time.37 in 2008 opponents of misick accused him of moving toward

government.45 politicians were accused of selling crown land for personal gain and misusing public funds.46 the following day galmo williams was sworn in as his replacement.4547 misick denied all

management.48 the move was met with vehement opposition by the former turks and caicos government with misick's successor williams calling it a coup and stating that our country is being invaded and re-colonised by the united kingdom dismantling a duly elected government and legislature and replacing it with a one-man dictatorship akin to that of the old red china all in the name of good governance.48 despite this the civilian populace was reported to be largely welcoming of the enforced rule.48 the british government stated that they intended to keep true to their word that the country would regain home rule in two years or less and foreign office minister chris bryant said that elections would be held in 2011 or sooner.49 governor wetherell stated that he would aim to make a clean break from the mistakes of the past and create a durable path towards good governance sound financial management and sustainable development wetherell added in the meantime we must all learn

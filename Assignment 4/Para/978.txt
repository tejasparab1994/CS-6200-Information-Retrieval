space station a space station also known as an orbital station or an orbital space station is a spacecraft capable of supporting crewmembers which is designed to remain in space most commonly as an artificial satellite in low earth orbit for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock a space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for human spaceflight by lack of major propulsion or landing systems instead other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station as of september 2016update three space stations are in orbit the international space station which is permanently inhabited china's tiangong-1 defunct and tiangong-2 launched 15 september 2016 not permanently inhabited.12 previous stations include the almaz and salyut series skylab and most recently mir today's space stations are research platforms used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body as well as to provide platforms for greater number and length of scientific studies than available on other space vehicles each crew member stays aboard the station for weeks or months but rarely more than a year since the ill-fated flight of soyuz 11 to salyut 1 all human spaceflight duration records have been set aboard space stations the duration record for a single spaceflight is 437.7 days set by valeriy polyakov aboard mir from 1994 to 1995 as of 2016update four cosmonauts have completed single missions of over a year all aboard mir space stations have also been used for both military and civilian purposes the last military-use space station was salyut 5 which was used by the almaz program of the soviet union in 1976 and 1977.3  contents  historyedit early conceptsedit the first space station was salyut 1 which was launched by the soviet union on april 19 1971 like all the early space stations it was monolithic intended to be constructed and launched in one piece and then inhabited by a crew later as such monolithic stations generally contained all their supplies and experimental equipment when launched and were considered expended and then abandoned when these were used up the earlier soviet stations were all designated salyut but among these there were two distinct types civilian and military the military stations salyut 2 salyut 3 and salyut 5 were also known as almaz stations the civilian stations salyut 6 and salyut 7 were built with two docking ports which allowed a second crew to visit bringing a new spacecraft with them the soyuz ferry could spend 90 days in space after which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh soyuz spacecraft.6 this allowed for a crew to man the station continually skylab was also equipped with two docking ports like second-generation stations but the extra port was never utilized the presence of a second port on the new stations allowed progress supply vehicles to be docked to the station meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions this concept was expanded on salyut 7 which hard docked with a tks tug shortly before it was abandoned this served as a proof-of-concept for the use of modular space stations the later salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups unlike previous stations the soviet space station mir had a modular design a core unit was launched and additional modules generally with a specific role were later added to that this method allows for greater flexibility in operation as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful launch vehicle modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches the core module of the international space station was launched in 1998 the iss is divided into two main sections the russian orbital segment ros and the united states operational segment usos usos modules were brought to the station by the space shuttle and manually attached to the iss by crews during evas connections are made manually for electrical data propulsion and cooling fluids this results in a single piece which is not designed for disassembly.7 the russian orbital segment's modules are able to launch fly and dock themselves without human intervention using proton rockets.8 connections are automatically made for power data and propulsion fluids and gases the russian approach allows assembly of space stations orbiting other worlds in preparation for human missions the nauka module of the iss will be used in the 12th russian/soviet space station opsek whose main goal is supporting human deep space exploration russian modular or 'next generation space stations differ from 'monolithic single piece stations by allowing reconfiguration of the station to suit changing needs according to a 2009 report rkk energia is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the russian orbital segment when the end of mission is reached for the iss and use them as a basis for a new station known as the orbital piloted assembly and experiment complex none of these modules would have reached the end of their useful lives in 2016 or 2020 the report presents a statement from an unnamed russian engineer who believes that based on the experience from mir a thirty-year life should be possible except for micrometeorite damage because the russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.9 china's first space laboratory tiangong-1 was launched in september 2011 the uncrewed shenzhou 8 then successfully performed an automatic rendezvous and docking in november 2011 the crewed shenzhou 9 then docked with tiangong-1 in june 2012 the crewed shenzhou 10 in 2013 tiangong-2 was launched in september 2016 and another space laboratory tiangong-3 is expected to be launched in subsequent years paving the way for the construction of a larger space station around 2020 in september 2016 it was reported that the tiangong-1 is falling back to earth and will burn in the atmosphere during 2017 habitabilityedit these stations have various issues that limit their long-term habitability such as very low recycling rates relatively high radiation levels and a lack of weight some of these problems cause discomfort and long-term health effects in the case of solar flares all current habitants are protected by the earth's magnetic field and are below the van allen belts future space habitats may attempt to address these issues and could be intended for long-term occupation some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people essentially cities in space where people would make their homes no such design has yet been constructed since even for a small station the current 2016 launch costs are not economically or politically viable possible ways to deal with these costs would be to build a large number of rockets economies of scale employ reusable rockets in situ resource utilisation or non-rocket spacelaunch methods such as space elevators for example in 1975 proposing to seek long-term habitability through artificial gravity and enough mass in space to allow high radiation shielding the most ambitious historical nasa study a conceptual 10000-person spacestation envisioned a future mass driver base launching 600 times its own mass in lunar material cumulatively over years.10 architectureedit a space station is a complex system with many interrelated subsystems environmental microbiologyedit molds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal glass and rubber.11 list of space stationsedit the soviet space stations came in two types the civilian durable orbital station dos and the military almaz stationsdates refer to periods when stations were inhabited by crews  canceled projectsedit future developmentsedit the business arrangement for developing and marketing the station was recently clarified by russian firm orbital

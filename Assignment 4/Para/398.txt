1991 perfect storm  contents  meteorological historyedit the perfect storm originated from a cold front that exited the east coast of the united states on october 28 the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of nova scotia around that time a ridge extended from the appalachian mountains northeastward to greenland with a strong high pressure center over eastern canada the blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west hurricane grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on october 29 the cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of hurricane grace the low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the united states.2 it had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years.3 most nor'easters affect new england from the southwest.4 preparations and namingedit for several days weather models forecast the development of a significant storm off new england.5 however the models were inadequate in forecasting coastal conditions which in one instance failed to provide adequate warning in addition a post-storm assessment found an insufficient number of observation sites along the coast.12 on october 27 the ocean prediction center noted that a dangerous storm would form within 36 hours with its wording emphasizing the unusual nature of the storm.13 the national weather service likewise issued warnings for the potential storm providing information to emergency service offices as well as the media.12 the public however was skeptical and did not recognize the threat.312 the timely warnings ultimately lowered the death toll;12 whereas the perfect storm caused 13 deaths the blizzard of 1978 killed 99 people and the 1938 new england hurricane killed 564 people.5 from massachusetts to maine thousands of people evacuated their homes and sought shelter.14 a state of emergency was declared for nine counties in massachusetts including suffolk county as well as two in maine.415 in north carolina the national weather service offices in hatteras and raleigh first issued a heavy surf advisory on october 27 more than eight hours before the first reports of high waves that same day a coastal flood watch and later a warning was issued along with a gale warning the hatteras nws office ultimately released 19 coastal flood statements as well as media reports explaining the threat from the wind and waves and a state of emergency was declared for dare county north carolina.14 the warnings and lead times in the region were described as very good.16 in canada the threat from the storm prompted the cancellation of ferry service from bar harbor maine to yarmouth nova scotia as well as from nova scotia to prince edward island and between nova scotia and newfoundland.6 in its tropical cyclone report on the hurricane the national hurricane center only referred to the system as unnamed hurricane.7 the natural disaster survey report called the storm the halloween nor'easter of 1991.5 the perfect storm moniker was coined by author and journalist sebastian junger after a conversation with nws boston deputy meteorologist robert case in which case described the convergence of weather conditions as being perfect for the formation of such a storm.3 other national weather service offices were tasked with issuing warnings for this storm in lieu of the typical nhc advisories the opc posted warnings on the unnamed hurricane in its high seas forecasts.13 the national weather service state forecast office in boston issued offshore marine forecasts for the storm local nws offices along the east coast covered the storm in their coastal waters forecasts.17 beginning in 1950 the national hurricane center named officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes the unnamed hurricane was reported to have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone but it was purposefully left unnamed this was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land it was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 atlantic hurricane season.818 had the system been named for whatever reason it would've received the name henri which was the next name on the 1991 list after grace impactedit following the storm's damage president george bush declared five counties in maine seven counties in massachusetts and rockingham county new hampshire to be disaster areas.1 the declaration allowed for the affected residents to apply for low-interest repair loans.23 new jersey governor jim florio requested a declaration for portions of the coastline but the request was denied because of the funding needs of other disasters such as hurricane hugo hurricane bob and the 1989 loma prieta earthquake.24 the american red cross opened service centers in four locations in massachusetts to assist the storm victims by providing food clothing medicine and shelter the agency deployed five vehicles carrying cleanup units and food and allocated $1.4 million to provide assistance to 3000 families.23 new england and

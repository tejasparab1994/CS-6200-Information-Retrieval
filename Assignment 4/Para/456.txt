alexandria to avoid confusion see the neighborhoods paragraph below in 1920 virginia's general assembly voted to incorporate what had been alexandria county as arlington county to minimize confusion  contents  historyedit colonial eraedit following the 1745 settlement of the virginia's 10 year dispute with lord fairfax over the western boundary of the northern neck proprietary when the privy council in london found in favor of lord fairfax's expanded claim some of the fairfax county gentry formed the ohio company of virginia they intended to conduct trade into the interior of america and they required a trading center near the head of navigation on the potomac the best location was hunting creek tobacco warehouse since the deep water could easily accommodate sailing ships many local tobacco planters however wanted a new town further up hunting creek away from nonproductive fields along the river.7 almost immediately upon establishment the town founders called the new town belhaven believed to be in honor of a scottish patriot john hamilton 2nd lord belhaven and stenton the northern neck tobacco trade being then dominated by scots the name belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a church and market house but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.10 the town of alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779 in 1755 general edward braddock organized his fatal expedition against fort duquesne at carlyle house in alexandria in april 1755 the governors of virginia and the provinces of maryland pennsylvania massachusetts and new york met to determine upon concerted action against the french in america.11 in march 1785 commissioners from virginia and maryland met in alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states finishing their business at mount vernon the mount vernon conference concluded on march 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the potomac river the maryland legislature in ratifying this agreement on november 22 proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations this led to the calling of the annapolis convention of 1786 which in turn led to the calling of the federal convention of 1787.11 in 1791 alexandria was included in the area chosen by george washington to become the district of columbia early 19th centuryedit in 1814 during the war of 1812 a british fleet launched a successful raid on alexandria which surrendered without a fight as

virginia theological seminary.13:116 from 1828 to 183614 alexandria was home to the franklin  armfield slave market one of the largest slave trading companies in the country by the 1830s they were sending more than 1000 slaves annually from alexandria to their natchez mississippi and new orleans markets to help meet the demand for slaves in mississippi and surrounding states.15 later owned by price birch  co. the slave pen became a jail under union occupation.16 late 19th centuryedit the first fatalities of the north and south in the american civil war occurred in alexandria within a month of the battle of fort sumter where two died union troops occupied alexandria landing troops at the base of king street on the potomac river on may 24 1861 a few blocks up king street from their landing site the commander of the new york fire zouaves colonel elmer e ellsworth sortied with a small detachment to retrieve a large confederate flag displayed on the roof of the marshall house inn that had been visible from the white house while descending from the roof ellsworth was shot dead by captain james w jackson the hotel's proprietor one of the ellsworth's soldier immediately killed jackson.18 ellsworth was publicized as a union martyr and the incident generated great excitement in the north with many children being named for him.18 jackson's death defending his home caused a similar though less lasting sensation in the south alexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the war fort ward one of a ring of forts built by the union army for the defense of washington d.c. is located inside the boundaries of present-day alexandria.19 after the creation by washington of the state of west virginia in 1863 and until the close of the war alexandria was the seat of the so-called restored government of virginia also known as the alexandria government.11 during the union occupation a recurring contention between the alexandria citizenry and the military occupiers was the union army's periodic insistence that church services include prayers for the president of the united states failure to do so resulted in incidents including the arrest of ministers in their church as of ratification of the fifteenth amendment alexandria county's black population was more than 8700 or about half the total number of residents in the county this newly enfranchised constituency provided the support necessary to elect the first black alexandrians to the city council and the virginia legislature.21 20th centuryedit at the turn of the 20th century the most common production in the city was glass fertilizer beer and leather the glass often went into beer bottles much of the virginia glass company effort went to supply the demands of the robert portner brewing company until fire destroyed the st asaph street plant on february 18 1905 the old dominion glass company also had a glass works fall to fire then built a new one the belle pre bottle company held a monopoly on a milk bottle that they patented yet that organization only lasted 10 years.22 most businesses were smaller where the business occupied the first floor of a building and the owner and family lived above 23:50 prohibition closed portner brewing in 1916.23:50 president woodrow wilson visited the virginia shipbuilding corporation on may 30 1918 to drive the first rivet into the keel

city.30:p1 in 1961 the woodrow wilson bridge opened.31 history of librariesedit john wise a local alexandria businessman and hotel keeper hosted a meeting in his home in 1789 to discuss the creation of a society for the promotion of useful knowledge members include rev james muir physician elisha cullen dick and george washington's personal attorney charles lee the society did not last for long however on july 24 1794 the founders of the society once again met at wise's home to establish a subscription library during the first year one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the library company of alexandria members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues the company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the general assembly of virginia druggist edward stabler was elected the first librarian and the library's first location is believed to have been housed in his apothecary shop james kennedy was elected the second librarian and the library moved to his residence and place of business kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the library company those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library the first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797 the collection grew over time bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books most members were initially men although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798 one noted female member in 1817 was mary l.f custis wife of george washington parke custis the catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books mostly on history and travel by 1815 there were 1022 entries in the catalog and the collection had added more biographies fiction and magazines the library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years including the new market house next to the city hall the lyceum company building and peabody hall which was owned by the alexandria school board raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge in 1853 a lecture series was created to raise money speakers included professor joseph henry of the smithsonian colonel francis h smith of the virginia military institute and humorist george w bagby the arrival of the civil war in 1861 took its toll on the library collection members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the library's occupation by union troops the library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time after the war the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879 the library company closed the remainder of its collection was stored in peabody hall in 1897 a group of women in alexandria formed the alexandria library association the leaders of the group were virginia corse mrs william b smoot and virginia burke they petitioned the school board to open a subscription library in peabody hall using the old books stored there permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on december 1 1897 in 1902 the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of prince street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the confederate hall located at 806 prince street in may 1903 the library moved to the confederate hall now known as the robert e lee camp hall museum where it stayed for 34 years in 1936 dr and mrs robert south barrett presented a proposal to the library association they agreed to donate a building in memory of dr barrett's mother kate waller barrett if the city would commit to running it as a public library the city agreed and the society of friends offered a 99-year lease on an old quaker graveyard located on queen street the old library was closed on march 1 for the books to be packed and moved to the new library which opened to the public in august 1937 the alexandria library association became the alexandria library society in 1939 the barrett library was the scene of possibly the nation's first sit-in demonstrations as samuel tucker a young law school graduate from the neighborhood and several other african-american residents insisted on access to the racially segregated library where they had been banned tucker later became a prominent attorney in richmond.3637 in 1947 the library society was reconstituted and took the earlier historic name alexandria library company a lecture series was also revived speakers included thomas jefferson biographer dumas malone some of the books belonging in the original collection of the alexandria library company can now be found in the local history/special collections room at the queen street library that still carries mrs barrett's name.38 in 1948 ellen coolidge burke became

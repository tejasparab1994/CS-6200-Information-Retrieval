road connecting st augustine to georgia the road crossed the st johns river at a narrow point which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british called the cow ford these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.242526 the british introduced the cultivation of sugar cane indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber as a result the northeastern florida area prospered economically more than it had under the spanish.27 britain ceded control of the territory to spain in 1783 after being defeated in the american revolutionary war and the settlement at the cow ford continued to grow after spain ceded the florida territory to the united states in 1821 american settlers on the north side of the cow ford decided to plan a town laying out the streets

forces in the skirmish of the brick church in 1862 confederates won their first victory in the state.28 however union forces captured a confederate position at the battle of st johns bluff and

landmarks to survive the fire governor william sherman jennings declared martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order on may 17 municipal authority resumed.32 it is said the glow from the flames could be seen in savannah georgia and the smoke plumes seen in raleigh north carolina known as the great fire of 1901 it was one of the worst disasters in florida history and the largest urban

the government of the city of jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the postwar economic boom mayor w haydon burns jacksonville story resulted in the construction of a new city hall civic auditorium public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride however the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class white flight resulted in a remaining population with a higher level of poverty overall.37 given the postwar migration of residents businesses and jobs the city's tax base declined it had difficulty funding education sanitation and traffic control within the city limits in addition residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services such as sewage and building code enforcement in 1958 a study recommended that the city of jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order to create the needed larger geographic tax base to improve services throughout the

indicted and more were forced to resign jacksonville consolidation led by j j daniel and claude yates began to win more support during this period from both inner-city blacks who wanted more involvement in government after passage of civil rights legislation restored their ability to vote and whites in the suburbs who wanted more services and more control over the central city in 1964 all 15 of duval county's public high schools lost their accreditation this added momentum to proposals for government reform lower taxes increased economic development unification of the community better

the plan on october 1 1968 the city and county governments merged to create the consolidated city of jacksonville fire police health  welfare recreation public works and housing  urban development were all combined under the new government in honor of the occasion then-mayor hans tanzler posed with actress lee meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the bold new city of the south at

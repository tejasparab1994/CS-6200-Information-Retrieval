thunderstorm a thunderstorm also known as an electrical storm lightning storm or thundershower is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the earth's atmosphere known as thunder.1 thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus they are usually accompanied by strong winds heavy rain and sometimes snow sleet hail or in contrast no precipitation at all thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband known as a squall line strong or severe thunderstorms known as supercells rotate as do cyclones while most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude where warm moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes.2 thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena thunderstorms and the phenomena that occur along with them pose great hazards damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds large hailstones and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts there are four types of thunderstorms single-cell multi-cell cluster multi-cell lines and supercells supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes dry thunderstorms with no precipitation can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them several means are used to study thunderstorms weather radar weather stations and video photography past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century beyond the earth's atmosphere thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of jupiter saturn neptune and probably venus  contents  life cycle warm air has a lower density than cool air so warmer air rises upwards and cooler air will settle at the bottom3 this effect can be seen with a hot air balloon.4 clouds form as relatively warmer air carrying moisture rises within cooler air the moist air rises and as it does so it cools and some of the water vapor in that rising air condenses.5 when the moisture condenses it releases energy known as latent heat of vaporization which allows the rising packet of air to cool less than the cooler surrounding air6 continuing the cloud's ascension if enough instability is present in the atmosphere this process will continue long enough for cumulonimbus clouds to form and produce lightning and thunder meteorological indices such as convective available potential energy cape and the lifted index can be used to assist in determining potential upward vertical development of clouds.7 generally thunderstorms require three conditions to form cumulus stage the first stage of a thunderstorm is the cumulus stage or developing stage during this stage masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere the trigger for this lift can be solar illumination where the heating of the ground produces thermals or where two winds converge forcing air upwards or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation the moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude which appear as cumulus clouds as the water vapor condenses into liquid latent heat is released which warms the air causing it to become less dense than the surrounding drier air the air tends to rise in an updraft through the process of convection hence the term convective precipitation this process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm in a typical thunderstorm approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the earth's atmosphere.10 mature stage in the mature stage of a thunderstorm the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther often this 'cap is the tropopause the air is instead forced to spread out giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape the resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus the water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles as these fall they melt to become rain if the updraft is strong enough the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail while updrafts are still present the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it creating downdrafts as well the simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds during this stage considerable internal turbulence can occur within which manifests as strong winds severe lightning and even tornadoes.11 typically if there is little wind shear the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out'8 but if there is sufficient change in wind speed or direction the downdraft will be separated from the updraft and the storm may become a supercell where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.12 dissipating stage classification single-cell multi-cell clusters multicell lines supercells severe thunderstorms mesoscale convective systems a mesoscale convective system mcs is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones and normally persists for several hours or more.33 a mesoscale convective system's overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones squall lines lake-effect snow events polar lows and mesoscale convective complexes mccs and they generally form near weather fronts most mesoscale convective systems develop overnight and continue their lifespan through the next day.8 the type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across north america europe and asia with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours.3435 forms of mcs that develop in the tropics are found in use either the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon troughs generally within the warm season between spring and fall more intense systems form over land than over water.3637 one exception is that of lake-effect snow bands which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water and occurs from fall through spring.38 polar lows are a second special class of mcs they form at high latitudes during the cold season.39 once the parent mcs dies later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex mcv.40 mesoscale convective systems are important to the united states rainfall climatology over the great plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall.41 motion back-building thunderstorm a back-building thunderstorm commonly referred to as a training thunderstorm is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side usually the west or southwest side in the northern hemisphere such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction though the storm often appears stationary on radar or even moving upwind this is an illusion the storm is really a multi-cell storm with new more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind.4243 when this happens catastrophic flooding is possible in rapid city south dakota in 1972 an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area resulting in devastating flash flooding.44 a similar event occurred in boscastle england on 16 august 2004.45 hazards each year many people are killed or seriously injured by severe thunderstorms despite the advance warning while severe thunderstorms are most common in the spring and summer they can occur at just about any time of the year cloud-to-ground lightning cloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting.46 under a regime of low precipitation lp thunderstorms where little precipitation is present rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat.47 direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion.48 in areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning like florida lightning causes several fatalities per year most commonly to people working outside.49 acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning distilled water has a neutral ph of 7 clean or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2 because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid a weak acid ph 5.6 in distilled water but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals.50 nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena51 caused by the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen can result in the production of acid rain if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation thus creating acid rain acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or certain other solid chemical compounds in ecosystems acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.52 hail any thunderstorm that produces hail that reaches the ground is known as a hailstorm.53 thunderclouds that are capable of producing hailstones are often seen obtaining green coloration hail is more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards known as orographic lifting thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely.54 one of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern india which reported one of the highest hail-related death tolls on record in 1888.55 china also experiences significant hailstorms.56 across europe croatia experiences frequent occurrences of hail.57 tornadoes and waterspouts the fujita scale and the enhanced fujita scale rate tornadoes by damage caused an ef0 tornado the weakest category damages trees but not substantial structures an ef5 tornado the strongest category rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers the similar torro scale ranges from a t0 for extremely weak tornadoes to t11 for the most powerful known tornadoes.68 doppler radar data photogrammetry and ground swirl patterns cycloidal marks may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.69 waterspouts have similar characteristics as tornadoes characterized by a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current that form over bodies of water connecting to large cumulonimbus clouds waterspouts are generally classified as forms of tornadoes or more specifically non-supercelled tornadoes that develop over large bodies of water.70 these spiralling columns of air are frequently developed within tropical areas close to the equator but are less common within areas of high latitude.71 flash flood flash flooding is the process where a landscape most notably an urban environment is subjected to rapid floods.72 these rapid floods occur more quickly and are more localized than seasonal river flooding or areal flooding73 and are frequently though not always associated with intense rainfall.74 flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and is usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it flash floods are most common in densely populated urban environments where few plants and bodies of water are present to absorb and contain the extra water flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure such as bridges and weakly constructed buildings plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water automobiles parked within affected areas can also be displaced soil erosion can occur as well exposing risks of landslide phenomena downburst downburst winds can produce numerous hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms downburst winds are generally very powerful and are often mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes75 due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable incomplete or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings agricultural crops and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash.875 automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it due to their higher density when these downdrafts reach the surface they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.8 thunderstorm asthma thunderstorm asthma is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm during a thunderstorm pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind while larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs triggering the asthma attack.76777879 safety precautions most thunderstorms come and go fairly uneventfully however any thunderstorm can become severe and all thunderstorms by definition present the danger of lightning.80 thunderstorm preparedness and safety refers to taking steps before during and after a thunderstorm to minimize injury and damage preparedness preparedness refers to precautions that should be taken before a thunderstorm some preparedness takes the form of general readiness as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year.81 preparing a family emergency plan for example can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly.82 preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees which can be blown over in high winds can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.83 the national weather service nws in the united states recommends several precautions that people should take if thunderstorms are likely to occur:81 safety while safety and preparedness often overlap thunderstorm safety generally refers to what people should do during and after a storm the american red cross recommends that people follow these precautions if a storm is imminent or in progress:80 the nws stopped recommending the lightning crouch in 2008 as it doesn't provide a significant level of protection and will not significantly lower the risk of being killed or injured from a nearby lightning strike.848586 frequent occurrences thunderstorms occur throughout the world even in the polar regions with the greatest frequency in tropical rainforest areas where they may occur nearly daily at any given time approximately 2000 thunderstorms are occurring on earth.87 kampala and tororo in uganda have each been mentioned as the most thunderous places on earth88 a claim also made for singapore and bogor on the indonesian island of java other cities known for frequent storm activity include darwin caracas manila and mumbai thunderstorms are associated with the various monsoon seasons around the globe and they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones.89 in temperate regions they are most frequent in spring and summer although they can occur along or ahead of cold fronts at any time of year.90 they may also occur within a cooler air mass following the passage of a cold front over a relatively warmer body of water thunderstorms are rare in polar regions because of cold surface temperatures some of the most powerful thunderstorms over the united states occur in the midwest and the southern states these storms can produce large hail and powerful tornadoes thunderstorms are relatively uncommon along much of the west coast of the united states91 but they occur with greater frequency in the inland areas particularly the sacramento and san joaquin valleys of california in spring and summer they occur nearly daily in certain areas of the rocky mountains as part of the north american monsoon regime in the northeast storms take on similar characteristics and patterns as the midwest but with less frequency and severity during the summer air-mass thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence over central and southern parts of florida types of lightning lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs in a thunderstorm it can be seen in the form of a bright streak or bolt from the sky lightning occurs when an electrical charge is built up within a cloud due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level when a large enough charge is built up a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning the temperature of a lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the surface of the sun.92 although the lightning is extremely hot the duration is short and 90 of strike victims survive contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot some people have been struck by lightning over three times and skyscrapers like the empire state building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.93 the loud bang that is heard is the super heated air around the lightning bolt expanding at the speed of sound because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang although both occur at the same moment there are several types of lightning energy the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor results show that gamma rays and antimatter particles positrons can be generated in powerful thunderstorms.97 it is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes tgf tgfs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning the streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays.98 about 500 tgfs may occur every day worldwide but mostly go undetected studies mythology and religion martin luther was out walking when a thunderstorm began causing him to pray to god for being saved and promising to become a monk.105 outside of earth thunderstorms evidenced by flashes of lightning on jupiter have been detected and are associated with clouds where water may exist as both a liquid and ice suggesting that a similar mechanism may act as on earth water is a polar molecule that can carry a charge so it is capable of creating the charge separation needed to produce lightning.106 these electrical discharges can be up to a thousand times as powerful as lightning on the earth.107 the water clouds can form thunderstorms driven by the heat rising from the interior.108 the clouds of venus may also be capable of producing lightning some observations suggest that the lightning rate is at least half of that on earth.109 see also references further reading external links navigation

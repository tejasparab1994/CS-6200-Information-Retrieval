thundersnow thundersnow also known as a winter thunderstorm or a thundersnowstorm is an unusual12 kind of thunderstorm with snow falling as the primary precipitation instead of rain it typically falls in regions of strong upward motion within the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone thermodynamically it is not different from any other type of thunderstorm but the top of the cumulonimbus cloud is usually quite low in addition to snow graupel or hail may fall  contents  occurrenceedit thundersnow while relatively rare anywhere is more common with lake-effect snow in the great lakes area of the united states and canada the midwestern united states and the great salt lake thundersnow also occurs in halifax nova scotia sometimes several times per winter season bozeman montana also sees thundersnow more often than average with these storms typically occurring in april or may in the united states march is the peak month of formation on average only 6.4 events are reported per year.3 the british isles and other parts of northwestern europe occasionally report thunder and lightning during sleet or usually wet snow showers during winter and spring it is also common around kanazawa and the sea of japan and even around mount everest low pressure events in the eastern mediterranean that originate from polar origin cause copious thundersnow occurrences during winter storms especially over the elevated provinces of israel and jordan including amman and jerusalem when such storms happen at areas intended for skiing the mountains are often evacuated for safety acoustic effectsedit formationedit there are usually three causes of thundersnow lake effect precipitationedit synoptic forcingedit synoptic snow storms tend to be large and complex with many possible factors affecting the development of thundersnow the best location in a storm to find thundersnow is typically in its northwest quadrant in the northern hemisphere based on observations in the midwestern united states within what is known as the comma head of a mature extratropical cyclone.56 thundersnow can also be located underneath the trowal a trough of warm air aloft which shows up in a surface weather analysis as an inverted trough extending backward into the cold sector from the main cyclone.7 in extreme cases thunderstorms along the cold front are transported towards the center of the low pressure system and will have their precipitation change to snow or ice once the cold front becomes a portion of the occluded front.6 the 1991 halloween blizzard superstorm of 1993 and white juan are examples of such blizzards featuring thundersnow upslope flowedit similar to the lake effect regime thundersnow is usually witnessed in terrain in the cold sector of an extratropical cyclone when a shortwave aloft moves into the region the shortwave will steepen the local lapse rates allowing for a greater possibility of both heavy snow at elevations where it is near or below freezing and occasionally thundersnow.8 hazardsedit see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

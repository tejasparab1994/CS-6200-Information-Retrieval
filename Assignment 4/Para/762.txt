ohio the state takes its name from the ohio river the name originated from the iroquois language word ohi-yo meaning great river or large creek.212223 partitioned from the northwest territory the state was admitted to the union as the 17th state and the first under the northwest ordinance on march 1 1803.1024 ohio is historically known as the buckeye state after its ohio buckeye trees and ohioans are also known as buckeyes.2 the government of ohio is composed of the executive branch led by the governor the legislative branch which comprises the ohio general assembly and the judicial branch which is led by the state supreme court ohio occupies 16 seats in the united states house of representatives.25 ohio is known for its status as both a swing state26 and a bellwether26 in national elections six presidents of the united states have been elected who had ohio as their home state  contents  etymology ohio derives from the iroquois language as their name for the ohio river alleghany river ohi:yo this is pronounced oh-hee-yoh with the i sound being held an extra second folk etymology claims that this translates as beautiful river however it appears that the word can be broken down as o- pronoun prefix translates as it  implies that whatever is about to follow it is considered a permanent condition of the item hih verb to spill  gihedenyo noun creek stream.27 that being said the most sensible translation ought to be continuously-spilling creek or continuously-giving creek. the word for creek is used instead of river since it still flows into a larger river the mississippi the common accent of ohio shifts regularly so there are multiple different accepted ways of saying ohio that have been common throughout the last century such as oh-hai-yuh uh-hai-yoh  uh-hai-yuh. the most recent shift that is beginning to surface sounds something along the lines of wh-hai-yuh. geography bounded on the east by the pennsylvania line on the south by the ohio river to the mouth of the great miami river on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the great miami aforesaid and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of lake michigan running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid from the mouth of the great miami until it shall intersect lake erie or the territorial line and thence with the same through lake erie to the pennsylvania line aforesaid ohio is bounded by the ohio river but nearly all of the river itself belongs to kentucky and west virginia in 1980 the u.s supreme court held that based on the wording of the cessation of territory by virginia which at that time included what is now kentucky and west virginia the boundary between ohio and kentucky and by implication west virginia is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792.30 ohio has only that portion of the river between the river's 1792 low-water mark and the present high-water mark the border with michigan has also changed as a result of the toledo war to angle slightly northeast to the north shore of the mouth of the maumee river much of ohio features glaciated till plains with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the great black swamp this glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the glaciated allegheny plateau and then by another belt known as the unglaciated allegheny plateau most of ohio is of low relief but the unglaciated allegheny plateau features rugged hills and forests the rugged southeastern quadrant of ohio stretching in an outward bow-like arc along the ohio river from the west virginia panhandle to the outskirts of cincinnati forms a distinct socio-economic unit geologically similar to parts of west virginia and southwestern pennsylvania this area's coal mining legacy dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of the state in 1965 the united states congress passed the appalachian regional development act at attempt to address the persistent poverty and growing economic despair of the appalachian region.31 this act defines 29 ohio counties as part of appalachia.32 while 1/3 of ohio's land mass is part of the federally defined appalachian region only 12.8 of ohioans live there 1.476 million people.33 significant rivers within the state include the cuyahoga river great miami river maumee river muskingum river and scioto river the rivers in the northern part of the state drain into the northern atlantic ocean via lake erie and the st lawrence river and the rivers in the southern part of the state drain into the gulf of mexico via the ohio river and then the mississippi the worst weather disaster in ohio history occurred along the great miami river in 1913 known as the great dayton flood the entire miami river watershed flooded including the downtown business district of dayton as a result the miami conservancy district was created as the first major flood plain engineering project in ohio and the united states.34 climate although predominantly not in a subtropical climate some warmer-climate flora and fauna does reach well into ohio for instance a number of trees with more southern ranges such as the blackjack oak quercus marilandica are found at their northernmost in ohio just north of the ohio river also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate several plants such as the southern magnolia magnolia grandiflora albizia julibrissin mimosa crape myrtle and even the occasional needle palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street yard and garden plantings in the bluegrass region of ohio but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state this interesting change may be observed while traveling through ohio on interstate 75 from cincinnati to toledo the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of cincinnati's common wall lizard one of the few examples of permanent subtropical fauna in ohio records

identified three additional distinct prehistoric cultures the fort ancient people the whittlesey focus people 55  the monongahela culture.56 all three cultures apparently disappeared in the 17th century perhaps decimated by infectious diseases spread in epidemics from early european contact the native americans had no immunity to common european diseases no one has ever definitively concluded which historically known peoples they may have been analogous to that being said it is generally believed that the shawnees may have absorbed the fort ancient people.55 it's also possible that the monongahela held no land in ohio during by the colonial era the mississippian culture were close to contemporaneous with and traded extensively with the fort ancient people american indians in the ohio valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the iroquois confederation based in central and western new york.57 after the beaver wars in the mid-17th century the iroquois claimed much of the ohio country as hunting and more importantly beaver-trapping ground after the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century which largely emptied the ohio country of indigenous people by the mid-to-late 17th century the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly algonquian many of these ohio-country nations were multi-ethnic sometimes multi-linguistic societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease war and subsequent social instability they subsisted on agriculture corn sunflowers beans etc. supplemented by seasonal hunts by the 18th century they were part of a larger global economy brought about by european entry into the fur trade.58 the indigenous nations to inhabit ohio in the historical period included the iroquoian petun known for their tobacco plantations erie thought to have been from northeast ohio  western pennsylvania but may have come from canada chonnonton conquered their way down from canada during beaver wars before being defeated by the iroquois confederacy  their allies wyandot a group of petun who became isolated around cleveland after the beaver wars commonly mistaken for the huron whom most surviving petun later joined59 the mingo seneca split off from the iroquois confederacy  moved to ohio in 18th century remained approx 100 years.  the iroquois confederacy conquered most of ohio at the bequest of the english in the 1660s pushed back to pennsylvania by french in 1701. the algonquian miami mostly from indiana. mascouten close sister tribe to miamis scattered during beaver wars mostly relocated to kentucky lenape arrived around the turn of the 18th century from east coast shawnee seceded from powhatan confederacy eventually came to ohio river  most likely merged with several other lesser known people in the region  odawa part of a confederacy that surrounded lake superior relocated to michigan  northwest ohio around the american revolution.  the siouan mosopelea moved to arkansas during beaver wars.6061 ohio country was also the site of indian massacres such as the yellow creek massacre gnadenhutten and pontiac's rebellion school massacre.62 most native peoples who remained in ohio were slowly bought out and convinced to leave or ordered to do so by law in the early 19th century with the indian removal act of 1830 colonial and revolutionary eras during the 18th century the french set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region beginning in 1754 france and great britain fought a war that was known in north america as the french and indian war and in europe as the seven years war as a result of the treaty of paris the french ceded control of ohio and the remainder of the old northwest to great britain pontiac's rebellion in the 1760s however posed a challenge to british military control.63 this came to an end with the colonists victory in the american revolution in the treaty of paris in 1783 britain ceded all claims to ohio country to the united states the united states created the northwest territory under the northwest ordinance of 1787.64 slavery was not permitted in the new territory settlement began with the founding of marietta by the ohio company of associates which had been formed by a group of american revolutionary war veterans following the ohio company the miami company also referred to as the symmes purchase claimed the southwestern section and the connecticut land company surveyed and settled the connecticut western reserve in present-day northeast ohio the old northwest territory originally included areas previously known as ohio country and illinois country as ohio prepared for statehood the indiana territory was created reducing the northwest territory to approximately the size of present-day ohio plus the eastern half of the lower peninsula of michigan and the eastern tip of the upper peninsula on february 19 1803 u.s president thomas jefferson signed an act of congress that approved ohio's boundaries and constitution.66 however congress had never passed a resolution formally admitting ohio as the 17th state the current custom of congress declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812disputed  discuss with louisiana's admission as the 18th state although no formal resolution of admission was required when the oversight was discovered in 1953 ohio congressman george h bender introduced a bill in congress to admit ohio to the union retroactive to march 1 1803 the date on which the ohio general assembly first convened.67 at a special session at the old state capital in chillicothe the ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood that was delivered to washington d.c on horseback on august 7 1953 the year of ohio's 150th anniversary president eisenhower signed a congressional joint resolution that officially declared march 1 1803 the date of ohio's admittance into the union.676869 ohio has had three capital cities chillicothe zanesville and columbus chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810 the capital was then moved to zanesville for two years as part of a state legislative compromise in order to get a bill passed the capital was then moved back to chillicothe which was the capital from 1812 to 1816 finally the capital was moved to columbus in order to have it near the geographic center of the state where it would be more accessible to most citizens although many native americans had migrated west to evade american encroachment others remained settled in the state sometimes assimilating in part shawnee leader tecumseh led an american indian confederacy in tecumseh's rebellion from 1811 to 1813 in 1830 under president andrew jackson the us government forced indian removal of most tribes to the indian territory west of the mississippi river in 1835 ohio fought with michigan in the toledo war a mostly bloodless boundary war over the toledo strip only one person was injured in the conflict congress intervened making michigan's admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict in exchange for giving up its claim to the toledo strip michigan was given the western two-thirds of the upper peninsula in addition to the eastern third that was already considered part of the state in 1912 a constitutional convention was held with charles b galbreath as secretary the result reflected the concerns of the progressive era it introduced the initiative and the referendum in addition it allowed the general assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the legislature under the jeffersonian principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear on ohio's general election ballots every 20 years the question asks whether a new convention is required although the question has appeared in 1932 1952 1972 and 1992 it has never been approved instead constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition to the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases eight us presidents hailed from ohio at the time of their elections

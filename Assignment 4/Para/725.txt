states to ratify the articles of confederation on february 9 1778.12 the state boycotted the 1787 convention which drew up the united states constitution13 and initially refused to ratify it;14 it was the last of the original states to do so on may 29 1790.1516  contents  origin of the name despite its name most of rhode island is located on the mainland of the united states its official name is state of rhode island and providence plantations which is derived from the merger of four colonial settlements the settlements of newport and portsmouth were situated on what is commonly called aquidneck island today but it was called rhode island in colonial times.1718 providence plantation was the name of the colony founded by roger williams in the area now known as the city of providence.19 this was adjoined by the settlement of warwick hence the plural providence plantations it is unclear how aquidneck island came to be known as rhode island but two historical events may have influenced the name the earliest documented use of the name rhode island for aquidneck was in 1637 by roger williams the name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words aquethneck shall be henceforth called the isle of rodes or rhode-island. the name isle of rodes is used in a legal document as late as 1646.2526 dutch maps as early as 1659 call the island red island roodt eylant roger williams was a theologian who was forced out of the massachusetts bay colony seeking religious and political tolerance he and others founded providence plantation as a free proprietary colony providence referred to the concept of divine providence and plantation was an english term for a colony state of rhode island and providence plantations is the longest official name of any state in the union 2009 contestation of the name in recent years the presence of the word plantation in the state's name became a sufficiently contested issue that the general assembly voted on june 25 2009 to hold a general referendum determining whether and providence plantations would be dropped from the official name advocates for excising plantation asserted that the word symbolized an alleged legacy of native disenfranchisement for many rhode islanders as well as the proliferation of slavery in the colonies and in the post-colonial united states rhode island abolished slavery in 1652 but the law was not enforced and by the early 18th century it was the epicenter of the north american slave trade according to the brown daily herald.2728 advocates for retaining the name argued that plantation was simply an archaic synonym for colony and bore no relation to slavery the referendum election was held on november 2 2010 and the people voted overwhelmingly 78 to 22% to retain the entire original name.29 geography rhode island has two distinct natural regions eastern rhode island contains the lowlands of the narragansett bay while western rhode island forms part of the new england upland rhode island's forests are part of the northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.32 a rare type of rock called cumberlandite is found only in rhode island specifically in the town of cumberland and is the state rock there were initially two known deposits of the mineral but it is an ore of iron and one of the deposits was extensively mined for its ferrous content.35 flora and fauna climate rhode island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes due to its location in new england catching the brunt of many storms blowing up the eastern seaboard some hurricanes that have done significant damage in the state are the 1938 new england hurricane hurricane carol 1954 hurricane donna 1960 and hurricane bob 1991 history in 1636 roger williams was banished from the massachusetts bay colony for his religious views and he settled at the top of narragansett bay on land sold or given to him by narragansett sachem canonicus he named the site providence having a sense of god's merciful providence unto me in my distress.39 eventually it became a place of religious freedom in 1638 after conferring with williams anne hutchinson william coddington john clarke philip sherman and other religious dissenters settled on aquidneck island then known as rhode island which was purchased from the local tribes who called it pocasset this settlement was called portsmouth and was governed by the portsmouth compact the southern part of the island became the separate settlement of newport after disagreements among the founders samuel gorton purchased lands at shawomet in 1642 from the narragansetts precipitating a dispute with the massachusetts bay colony in 1644 providence portsmouth and newport united for their common independence as the colony of rhode island and providence plantations governed by an elected council and president gorton received a separate charter for his settlement in 1648 which he named warwick after his patron.40 brown university was founded in 1764 as the college in the english colony of rhode island and providence plantations it was one of nine colonial colleges granted charters before the american revolution but was the first college in america to accept students regardless of religious affiliation.41 the colony was amalgamated into the dominion of new england in 1686 as king james ii attempted to enforce royal authority over the autonomous colonies in british north america after the glorious revolution of 1688 the colony regained its independence under the royal charter slaves were introduced at this time although there is no record of any law legalizing slave-holding the colony later prospered under the slave trade distilling rum to sell in africa as part of a profitable triangular trade in slaves and sugar with the caribbean.44 rhode island was heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-revolution era in 1774 the slave population of rhode island was 6.3%50 nearly twice as high as any other new england colonycitation needed rhode island was also heavily involved in the industrial revolution which began in america in 1787 when thomas somers reproduced textile machine plans which he imported from england he helped to produce the beverly cotton manufactory in which moses brown of providence took an interest moses brown teamed up with samuel slater and helped to create the second cotton mill in america a water-powered textile mill the industrial revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities creating a permanently landless class who were therefore also voteless by 1829 60 of the state's free white males were ineligible to vote several attempts were unsuccessfully made to address this problem and a new state constitution was passed in 1843 allowing landless men to vote if they could pay a $1 poll tax for the first several decades of statehood rhode island was governed in accordance with the 1663 colonial charter voting rights were restricted to landowners holding at least $134 in property disenfranchising well over half of the state's male citizens the charter apportioned legislative seats equally among the state's towns over-representing rural areas and under-representing the growing industrial centers additionally the charter disallowed landless citizens from filing civil suits without endorsement from a landowner.51 bills were periodically introduced in the legislature to expand suffrage but they were invariably defeated in 1841 activists led by thomas w dorr organized an extralegal convention to draft a state constitution52 arguing that the charter government violated the guarantee clause in article four section four of the united states constitution in 1842 the charter government and dorr's supporters held separate elections and two rival governments claimed sovereignty over the state dorr's supporters led an armed rebellion against the charter government and dorr was arrested and imprisoned for treason against the state.53 later that year the legislature drafted a state constitution removing property requirements for american-born citizens but keeping them in place for immigrants and retaining urban under-representation in the legislature.54 in the early 19th century rhode island was subject to a tuberculosis outbreak which led to public hysteria about vampirism civil war during the american

of prosperity and affluence that author william g mcloughlin calls rhode island's halcyon era. rhode island was a center of the gilded age and provided a home or summer home to many of the country's most prominent industrialists this was a time of growth in textile mills and manufacturing and brought an influx of immigrants to fill those jobs bringing population growth and urbanization in newport

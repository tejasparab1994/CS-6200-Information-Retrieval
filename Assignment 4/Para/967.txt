kennedy space center launch complex 39 launch complex 39 lc-39 is a rocket launch site at the john f kennedy space center on merritt island in florida united states the site and its collection of facilities were originally built for the apollo program and later modified for the space shuttle program as of 2017 only launch complex 39a is active launching spacex's falcon 9 lc-39 is also being modified to support launches of the spacex's dragon 2 and falcon heavy as well as nasa's space launch system with a new smaller pad c added to support smaller launches spacex leases launch pad 39a from nasa and has modified the pad to support falcon heavy launches in 2017 and beyond.34 nasa began modifying launch pad 39b in 2007 to accommodate the now defunct project constellation and is currently preparing it for the space launch system56 with first launch scheduled for 2018.7 pad c was originally planned but never built for apollo and would have been a copy of pads 39a and 39b a smaller pad designated 39c was constructed from january to june 2015 to accommodate small-class vehicles.8  contents  historyedit early historyedit in 1948 the navy transferred the former banana river naval air station located south of cape canaveral to the air force for use in testing captured german v-2 rockets.11 the site's location on the east florida coast was ideal for this purpose in that launches would be over the ocean away from populated areas this site became the joint long range proving ground in 1949 and was renamed patrick air force base in 1950 the air force annexed part of cape canaveral to the north in 1951 forming the air force missile test center the future cape canaveral air force station ccafs missile and rocketry testing and development would take place here through the 1950s.12 after the creation of nasa in 1958 the ccafs launch pads were used for nasa's civilian unmanned and manned launches including those of project mercury and project gemini.13 apollo and skylabedit initial designedit integration of space vehicle stackedit the umbilical tower contained two elevators and nine retractable swing arms which extended to the space vehicle to provide access to each of the three rocket stages and the spacecraft for people wiring and plumbing while the vehicle was on the launch pad and swung away from the vehicle at launch.1718 technicians engineers and astronauts used the uppermost spacecraft access arm to access the crew cabin at the end of the arm the white room provided an environmentally controlled and protected area for astronauts and their equipment to enter the spacecraft.19 transportation to the padedit mobile service structureedit flame deflectoredit launch control and fuelingedit emergency evacuation systemedit pad terminal connection roomedit apollo and skylab launchesedit a total of thirteen saturn vs were launched for apollo and the unmanned launch of the skylab space station in 1973 the mobile launchers were then modified for the shorter saturn ib rockets by adding a milk-stool extension platform to the launch pedestal so that the s-ivb upper stage and apollo spacecraft swing arms would reach these were used for three manned skylab flights and the apollo-soyuz test project since the saturn ib pads 34 and 37 at cape canaveral afb had been decommissioned.2324 space shuttleedit payload to be installed at the launch pad was independently transported in a payload transportation canister then installed vertically at the payload changeout room otherwise payloads would have already been pre-installed at the orbiter processing facility and transported within the orbiter's cargo bay launch towersedit sound suppression water systemedit swing arm modificationsedit the gaseous oxygen vent arm positioned a hood often called the beanie cap over the top of the external tank et nose cone during fueling.when? heated gaseous nitrogen was used there to remove the extremely cold gaseous oxygen that normally vented out of the external tank this prevented the formation of ice that could fall and damage the shuttle.26 the hydrogen vent line access arm mated the external tank et ground umbilical carrier plate gucp to the launch pad hydrogen vent line the gucp provided support for plumbing and cables called umbilicals that transferred fluids gases and electrical signals between two pieces of equipment while the et was being fueled hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank through the gucp out a vent line to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance sensors at the gucp measured gas level the gucp was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of sts-127 and were also detected during attempts to launch sts-119 and sts-133.27 the gucp released from the et at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames emergency pad evacuationedit space shuttle launchesedit constellation program and pad 39bedit the last shuttle launch from pad 39b was the nighttime launch of sts-116 on december 9 2006 to support the final shuttle mission to the hubble space telescope sts-125 launched from pad 39a in may 2009 endeavour was placed on 39b if needed to launch the sts-400 rescue mission with the retirement of the shuttle in 201134 and the cancellation of constellation program in 2010 the future of the lc-39 pads was uncertain by early 2011 nasa began informal discussions on use of the pads and facilities by private companies to fly missions for the commercial space market35 culminating in a 20-year lease agreement with spacex for pad 39a.36 pad 39aedit just like the first 24 shuttle flights pad 39a supported the final manifested shuttle flights starting with sts-117 in june 2007 until the retirement of the shuttle fleet in july 2011 prior to the spacex lease agreement the pad remained as it was when atlantis launched on the final shuttle mission on july 8 2011 complete with a mobile launcher platform by early 2013 nasa publicly announced that it would allow commercial launch providers to lease pad 39a38 and followed that in may 2013 with a formal solicitation for proposals for commercial use of launch pad 39a.39 there were two competing bids for the commercial use of the launch complex.40 spacex submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex while jeff bezos blue origin submitted a bid for shared non-exclusive use of the complex such that the launchpad would interface with multiple vehicles and costs could be shared over the long term one potential shared user in the blue origin plan was united launch alliance.41 prior to completion of the bid period and prior to any public announcement by nasa of the results of the process blue origin filed a protest with the u.s general accounting office gao over what it says is a plan by nasa to award an exclusive commercial lease to spacex for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39a.42 nasa had planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by october 1 2013 but the protest will delay any decision until the gao reaches a decision expected by mid-december.42 on december 12 2013 the gao denied the protest and sided with nasa which argued that the solicitation contains no preference on the use of the facility as multi-use or single-use the solicitation document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility.43 on december 13 2013 nasa announced that they had selected spacex as the new commercial tenant.44 spacex signed the lease agreement on april 14 2014.36 they have been given a twenty-year exclusive lease of pad 39a.40 spacex plans to launch their falcon 9 and falcon heavy from the pad and build a new hangar near it.403645 elon musk ceo of spacex has stated that he wants to shift most of their nasa launches to pad 39a including commercial cargo and crew missions to the international space station.4446 current statusedit launch pad 39aedit on april 14 2014 the privately owned launch service provider spacex signed a 20-year lease for launch pad 39a.47 the pad was modified to support launches of both falcon 9 and falcon heavy launch vehicles which included the construction of a horizontal integration facility similar to that used at existing spacex-leased facilities at cape canaveral air force station and vandenberg air force base  this is a marked difference from the vertical integration process used by nasa's own apollo and space shuttle vehicles at the launch complex 39 additionally new instrumentation and control systems were installed and substantial new plumbing was added for a variety of rocket liquids and gasses.4849 construction and first launchedit in 2015 spacex built a large horizontal integration facility hif just outside the perimeter of the existing launch pad in order to house both the falcon 9 and the falcon heavy rockets and their associated hardware and payloads during preparation for flight.50 both types of launch vehicles will be transported from the hif to the launch pad aboard a transporter erector te which will ride on rails up the former crawlerway path.3750 also in 2015 the launch mount for the falcon heavy was constructed on pad 39a over the existing infrastructure.5152 the work on both the hif building and the pad were substantially complete by late 2015.53 a rollout test of the new transporter/erector te was conducted in november 2015.54 spacex indicated in february 2016 that they had completed and activated launch complex 39a55 but still has more work yet to do to support crewed flights spacex originally planned to be ready to accomplish the first launch at pad 39a  a falcon heavy  as early as 201548 as they had architects and engineers working on the new design and modifications since 2013.5651 by late 2014 a preliminary date for a wet dress rehearsal of the falcon heavy was set for no earlier than july 1 2015.37 due to a failure in a june 2015 falcon 9 launch spacex had to delay launching the falcon heavy in order to focus on the falcon 9's failure investigation and its return to flight.57 in early 2016 considering the busy falcon 9 launch manifest it became unclear if falcon heavy would be the first vehicle to launch from pad 39a or if one or more falcon 9 missions would precede a falcon heavy launch.55 the first spacex launch from pad 39a was spacex crs-10 using a falcon 9 on february 19 2017 it was the company's 10th cargo resupply mission to the international space station58 and the first unmanned launch from 39a since skylab future flightsedit as a result of ongoing reconstruction at slc-40 after the loss of the amos-6 satellite all spacex's east coast launches are being launched from lc-39a until slc-40 is back to operational status currently scheduled for no earlier than december of 2017 on may 1 2017 nrol-76 was the first spacex mission for the national reconnaissance office with a classified payload.59 future notable missions include capabilitiesedit nasa has already removed the orbiter servicing arm  with intent to use the space later to build a museum  and white room by which astronauts entered the space shuttle.51 spacex indicated in late 2014 that no additional levels to the fss would be added in the near term.37fspacex plans to later add at least two additional levels to the fss and will utilize the fss for providing crew access for the dragon v2 launches.64 launch vehicles will be assembled horizontally in a hangar near the pad transferred to the pad and then lifted atop a launch platform for the remainder of the launch prep and lift off.56 for military missions from pad 39a payloads will be vertically integrated as that is required per launch contract with the us air force.56 a hammerhead crane is planned to be added to the fss in order to support us military requirements for vertical payload integration.64 launch pad 39bedit since the ares i-x flight nasa proceeded with plans to strip pad 39b of its flight service structure fss returning the location to an apollo-like clean pad design for the first time since 1977 this approach will make the pad available to multiple types of vehicles which arrive at the pad with service structures on the mobile launcher platform as opposed to custom structures on the pad.66 the lh2 lox and water tanks used for the sound suppression system are the only structures left from the space shuttle era.676869 in 2014 nasa announced that it would make pad 39b available to commercial users during times when it is not needed by the space launch system.56 as of may 2017update nasa has one sls mission scheduled in 2019 and a second one in 2021.56 launch pad 39cedit launch pad 39c is a new facility for smaller launch vehicles built in 2015 within the launch complex 39b perimeter constructionedit construction of the pad began in january 2015 and was completed in june 2015 kennedy space center director robert d cabana and representatives from the ground systems development and operations gsdo program and the center planning and development cpd and engineering directorates marked the completion of the new pad during a ribbon-cutting ceremony july 17 2015 as america's premier spaceport we're always looking for new and innovative ways to meet america's launch needs and one area that was missing was small class payloads robert d cabana said using 21st century funds we built pad 39c.8 gsdo oversaw the project and is working with cpd to grow commercial space efforts at kennedy.8 pad 39c is the latest addition to our portfolio of launch pads said scott colloredo cpd director the small class market is here the demand for that kind of launcher is increasing the key here is this is really what a launch site for a small class launcher needs to look like.8 gsdo also developed a universal propellant servicing system to provide liquid oxygen and liquid methane fueling capabilities for a variety of small class rockets.8 this is absolutely great to designate a new pad within the confines of pad 39b i'm looking forward to having customers here in the not too distant future making use of this outstanding facility robert d cabana said8 capabilitiesedit galleryedit space shuttle enterprise on pad 39a during the fit check tests 1979 space shuttles atlantis and endeavour are placed

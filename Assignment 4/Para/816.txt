hurricane elena the hurricane's unpredictable shifts in direction created what was considered the largest peacetime evacuation in the nation's history evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm's forecast positions and many residents and tourists along portions of the gulf coast were forced to leave twice in a matter of days preparations were generally timely and efficient though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin and many refugees tried to return home against officials orders about 1.25 million people fled the storm in florida alone contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees tropical cyclone warnings and watches were continuously issued and adjusted and forecasters stressed the storm's destructive potential for days  contents  meteorological historyedit after passing north of havana cuba elena emerged into the gulf of mexico at 12:00 utc on august 29 elena intensified into a category 1 hurricane.3 analysis of steering currents through the morning of august 30 suggested that elena would continue on its northwestward track striking the area between new orleans louisiana and biloxi mississippi within 30 hours.4 unexpectedly a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents allowing elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed.25 roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity the storm abruptly turned east in response to the trough.2 having defied initial forecasts hurricane elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest florida forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the florida peninsula and into the western atlantic however the relatively weak trough moved rapidly and instead of fully engaging elena its axis passed over the storm's center further post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.4 preparationsedit the unpredictable nature of the hurricane in conjunction with its arrival at popular tourist destinations on the labor day holiday weekend severely complicated preparations along the gulf coast.6 evacuations and the hoisting of weather advisories inadvertently occurred in stages to keep up with elena's shifts in direction hurricane warnings were in effect at one point or another for every coastal location between morgan city louisiana and sarasota florida much of the northern gulf coast was under a hurricane warning on two separate occasions for two different trajectories of the storm.10 evacuations of residents and vacationers also overlapped in many cases.6 collectively this led to the largest number of people ever evacuated according to robert case.11 some evacuees moved inland to meet relatives but many stayed relatively local filling hotels and designated shelters such as schools and churches.6 despite the unusually fluid scenario officials were well aware of the storm's destructive power days before its actual landfall national hurricane center hurricane expert bob sheets cautioned on august 30 that elena will be over a $1 billion storm.12 by the evening of august 30 after elena's sharp turn to the east hurricane warnings along most of the northern gulf coast were discontinued in accordance evacuees between louisiana and the four westernmost counties of the florida panhandle returned home as shelters closed.1920 with the storm's new course the area of highest threat translated east to the remainder of the panhandle and the western florida peninsula.620 as such governor graham recommended evacuations south to the tampa area late on august 30.19 a mandatory evacuation was then issued overnight for ten more coastal counties encompassing 573000 affected individuals.620 on august 31 governor graham advised residents in vulnerable areas of 15 inland counties to find safer ground.21 in response to the heightening danger most of the national guard troops previously on standby were sent to block access to certain areas and an additional 3000 were placed on standby.22 in the greater st petersburg pinellas county area alone 320000 people evacuated ahead of the storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history.2324 the large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities highways and contingencies although the number of people required to leave far exceeded the capacity of pinellas county shelters20 only 120000 of the 300000 or more refugees made use of the shelters.24 still official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives or increased awareness of available resources post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90 in pinellas county25 and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours rather than the expected 15.24 with over 200000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central florida evacuees became restless as a result of the duration of the storm supplies such as food ran short and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely.22 the threat of hurricane elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients tampa general hospital at 84 of patient capacity was evacuated four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in pinellas county were also cleared overall nearly 2000 nursing home patients were transported to safety although successful the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortages.26 impactedit a large aspect of the hurricane's devastation was the havoc it wrought on the eastern gulf of mexico oyster industry particularly in the apalachicola bay area and off the coast of alabama.4344 elena subjected the apalachicola bay reefs to high winds strong tidal action and moderate to heavy rainfall churning up huge quantities of silt and mud which suffocated up to 90 of live oysters and virtually destroyed the most important harvesting sites.4345 commercial harvesting was suspended until may 1986 at which time some of the prominent reefs of the eastern apalachicola bay system were deemed able to sustain oyster-catching.46 low astronomical tides amplified the effects of severe turbulence in the water.44 thousands of individuals relying on the apalachicola bay oyster industry soon found themselves struggling to make a living;43 losses in production at two major reefs were expected to surpass $30 million.45 all of alabama's major reefs were affected by the hurricane and its most productive was nearly destroyed.42 the problem was later confounded in november by hurricane kate which according to the national hurricane center dealt the final blow to certain oyster beds.47 floridaedit when tropical cyclones move over land they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability required for the development of weak embedded supercell thunderstorms which can produce tornadoes these tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived but still capable of producing significant damage.80 while centered over the gulf of mexico the eastern side of hurricane elena's circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central florida.9 a tornado struck just east of leesburg on september 1 destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes and damaging another 118 seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.81 later that same day another tornado touched down over downtown leesburg with much less damage.82 in nearby marion county tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes compromised another 50 residences and inflicted as much as $500000 in total losses though only minor injuries were reported.83 at kennedy space center launch complex 39 in cape canaveral a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where space shuttle atlantis was being prepared for its first flight.84 a tornado in new port richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees68 and tornadic activity was also identified in sumter county.84 the hurricane took one life in the state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths in daytona beach a tree struck a parked vehicle killing a person inside the exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado.85 elsewhere two individuals died of heart attacks one while installing storm shutters on his home and another at a designated shelter.32 alabamaedit with its location close to the storm's center dauphin island saw the greatest damage in alabama access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane slowing the progression of damage assessments.88 additionally the storm cut power and phone services.89 post-storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds.90 first-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases entire elevated homes were torn from their pilings and swept into the gulf of mexico.91 the number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 5092 though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings.90 in total the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on dauphin island accounting for nearly 25 of all homes and a further 235 sustained substantial damage.92 an unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was $30 million.86 wave action took a toll on the foundations of waterfront structures along the coasts of baldwin and mobile counties93 where elena inflicted about $715000 worth of damage to roadways.95 most damage was concentrated near the shore where extensive erosion took place and on islands and minor peninsulas farther inland elena's impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines.87 the storm destroyed the city boardwalk at gulf shores with the cost of rebuilding expected to approach $300000 alabama power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100000 customers.8688 according to the insurance information institute storm-related damages in alabama totaled about $100 million.96 an estimated 300 homes in the state were destroyed by hurricane elena and another 1345 sustained lighter damage.87 mississippiedit there were numerous reports in southern mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane's effects.36 reports in gulfport indicated that three schools actively being used as hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes at one location almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens center endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows doors and part of its roof about 20 people required rescue by paramedics only minor injuries occurred in association with the possible tornadoes.98109 teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that a significant portion of the damage in southern mississippi had been done by tornadoes as a result few tornadoes were confirmed9 and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane's nature or potentially localized microbursts.36108 any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane's synoptic winds.108 the storm left 80000 mississippi power company customers without electricity most of jackson county's 126000 residents were affected by the outage.102110 operations at ingalls shipbuilding in pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyard's buildings and cranes110 and at least two other shipyards in the state were affected by the hurricane.111 additionally the storm forced the temporary closure of the chevron usa refinery at pascagoula.107 facilities at horn island in the gulf islands national seashore buccaneer state park and the mississippi sandhill crane national wildlife refuge required repairs following the storm at the latter damages included the cost of healing a florida sandhill crane's injured leg thirty seafood processing plants were damaged and one was destroyed.111 the red cross estimated that 200 single-family houses in the state were destroyed and some 13200 were damaged 1200 of them heavily additionally the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2290.112 the overall cost of damage in mississippi alone approached $1 billion.108 louisianaedit after moving inland the storm's northwestward track brought it over the louisiana border on two separate occasions5 first reaching washington parish as a minimal hurricane winds there were strong enough to bring down hundreds of trees damaging houses and knocking out power to over 15000 customers in the process.113114115 the hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strewn debris throughout communities such as bogalusa and franklinton in washington parish the hardest-hit area in the state.31 downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses chiefly near bogalusa.113 elsewhereedit early in its formative stages elena triggered rainshowers and thunderstorms over parts of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola.125 later the mature hurricane generated strong rip currents as far away as south padre island texas where two swimmers drowned in separate incidents over the labor day weekend both victims were male texas residents.100126 aftermathedit hurricane elena has a multifaceted legacy it is remembered not only for its severe impacts but also for its unpredictability and the wide extent of pre-storm preparations.39 due to its notoriety the name elena was retired from the cyclical list of atlantic hurricane names in the spring of 1986 consequently it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane.127 the name was replaced by erika which was first used during the 1991 season.3 floridaedit in the days following the storm residents of cedar key were forbidden from returning to their homes and businesses while washed-out roadways underwent repairs and debris was cleared portable toilets were delivered and clean water trucked in for use while the city's infrastructure was being stabilized.132 after the city of cedar key dropped its participation in the national flood insurance program in early 1984 leaving residents unable to purchase flood insurance for their property the city council voted unanimously to return to the program after hurricane elena.69 tourism decreased significantly in some areas due to prospective travelers concerns about the extent of the damage the hurricane created a 13 drop in visitors between october 1984 and october 1985 in pinellas county marking an early end to the annual tourist season which generally ends after labor day weekend tourist spending fell accordingly.133 after the storm residents were allowed to return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis once authorized to enter their communities many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians in turn dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations in pinellas county laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters as part of the proposed laws the county sheriff as opposed to local officials would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen.134 despite extensive resistance county commissioners approved the change giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders.135 an additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies during hurricane elena intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.134135 to help the apalachicola bay shellfish industry recover special regulations were put in place to monitor harvests and $2 million was designated toward rehabilitation efforts using a portion of the funds out-of-work oyster catchers were employed to repopulate crucial reefs.44 the state of florida also issued a grant to help individuals in the crippled seafood industry make necessary payments.136 efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued in the months following the storm local tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in january 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in franklin county.137 on september 1 and 2 florida power company received help from gulf coast companies to return power to 170000 customers before the assisting companies home areas were struck by the hurricane power was restored to most areas by september 4 with an exception being st george's island service was expected to be restored after several additional days.37 more broadly owners of heavily damaged homes in the state faced new regulations on coastal construction in the state which went into effect less than a month after the storm the new rules entailed more rigorous study of factors such as a property's prior history and surrounding buildings before approval to rebuild a demolished structure would be granted governor graham preliminarily advised that houses more than halfway destroyed not be rebuilt.138 recovery efforts after hurricane elena continued to a small degree for years after its passage for example beach replenishment at indian rocks beach in pinellas county began in the summer of 1990.139 central gulf coastedit power companies from several states sent workers to help restore service to the hardest-hit areas of the gulf coast.40 most of alabama power's affected customers had power within 24 hours of the storm though restoration of service to dauphin island took significantly longer power was fully restored to central louisiana electric customers by september 4.37 alabama's two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on september 7.140141 special loan assistance was made available by the small business administration and the farmers home administration the latter of which sought to help commercial growers who lost their crops to the storm.141 mississippi governor william allain sent 500 members of the national guard to partner with 200 law enforcement officers along mississippi's coast in minimizing crime and nighttime curfews were established in several cities.40 on september 4 president reagan declared mississippi's coastal counties a major disaster area.142143 the federal emergency management agency estimated that as many as 3000 homes in the state were uninhabitable their occupants forced to find temporary living arrangements the small business administration approved special loans up to $500000 for owners of damaged businesses.143 mississippi power company's system was the hardest-hit37 and restoration of service was slow 50000 of 80000 customers were still without electricity by september 5.102 by september 5 the salvation army red cross and other organizations had served 100000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in mississippi and federal food stocks became available for the state to distribute to storm victims.144 still resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations and long lines formed at the first few stores and gas stations to reopen with dwindling supplies the salvation army had to procure food from other parts of the region to serve to victims.102 in the days after the hurricane an increase in heart attack deaths in the harrison county area was noted.144 see alsoedit notesedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants

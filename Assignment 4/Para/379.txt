cape cod cape cod is a geographic cape extending into the atlantic ocean from the southeastern corner of mainland massachusetts in the northeastern united states its historic maritime character and ample beaches attract heavy tourism during the summer months as defined by the cape cod commission's enabling legislation cape cod is conterminous with barnstable county massachusetts.2 it extends from provincetown in the northeast to woods hole in the southwest and is bordered by plymouth to the northwest  contents  region of cape cod and the islands edit like cape cod itself the islands south of the cape have evolved from whaling and trading areas to become resort destinations attracting wealthy families celebrities and other tourists these include the large nearby islands of nantucket and martha's vineyard which have grown in population by 6.8 percent and 10.3 percent respectively between 2000 and 2010 while the year-round population of barnstable county dropped 3 percent according to the census.3 both islands are also famous summer tourist destinations commonly accessed by ferry from several locations on the cape the phrases cape cod and the islands and the cape and islands are often used to describe the whole region of barnstable county dukes county including martha's vineyard and the smaller elizabeth islands and nantucket county several small islands right off cape cod including monomoy island monomoscoy island popponesset island and seconsett island are also in barnstable county the forbes family-owned naushon island was first purchased by john murray forbes naushon is one of the elizabeth islands many of which are privately owned one of the publicly accessible elizabeths is the southernmost island in the chain cuttyhunk with a year-round population of 52 people several prominent families have established compounds or estates on the larger islands making these islands some of the wealthiest resorts in the northeast yet they retain much of the early merchant trading and whaling culture cape cod in particular is a popular retirement area 27.8 of the population of barnstable county is 65 years old or older.4 and the average age of residents is the highest of any area in new england.citation needed by voter registration numbers democrats outnumber republicans by less in the three counties than in the whole of massachusetts to varying degrees.5 the bulk of the land in the area is glacial terminal moraine and represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast new england similar glacial formations make up long island in new york and block island in rhode island.citation needed geography and political divisionsedit physical geography and boundariesedit the name cape cod as it was first used in 1602 applied only to the very tip of the peninsula it remained that way for 125 years until the precinct of cape cod was incorporated as the town of provincetown no longer in official use over the ensuing decades the name came to mean all of the land east of the manomet and scusset rivers  essentially along the line that became the cape cod canal the creation of the canal separated the majority of the peninsula from the mainland most agencies including the cape cod commission and the federal emergency management agency fema treat the cape as an island with regard to disaster preparedness groundwater management and the like.167 cape codders tend to refer to the land on the mainland side of the canal as off-cape though the legal delineation of cape cod coincident to the boundaries of barnstable county includes portions of the towns of bourne and sandwich that are located north of the canal one of the biggest barrier islands in the world cape cod shields much of the massachusetts coastline from north atlantic storm waves this protection erodes the cape's shoreline at the expense of its cliffs while protecting towns from fairhaven to marshfield cape cod and the islands are part of a continuous archipelagic region consisting of a thin line of islands stretching west to include long island this region is historically and collectively known by naturalists as the outer lands towns and villagesedit cape cod incorporates all of barnstable county which comprises 15 towns bourne sandwich falmouth mashpee barnstable yarmouth harwich dennis brewster chatham orleans eastham wellfleet truro and provincetown each of these towns include a number of villages see barnstable county for a complete list barnstable the most populated municipality on cape cod is the only one to have adopted a city form of government whose legislative body is an elected 13-member council.1011 however like other smaller massachusetts cities barnstable retained its town of barnstable moniker all of the other towns elect a 5-member board of selectmen as the executive policy-setting board and utilize town meetings as their legislative body.10 cape cod and the islandsedit to the south of cape cod lie nantucket sound nantucket and martha's vineyard both large islands and the mostly privately owned elizabeth islands sectionsedit for most of the 18th 19th and 20th centuries cape cod was considered to consist of three sections see map upper and loweredit the terms upper cape and lower cape and references to traveling up cape or down cape have long been a source of confusion for the uninitiated cape cod visitor who mistakenly associating up with north might get turned around by passages such as these from 1920 there are many theories to explain the apparent paradox one is that the terms derive from early nautical navigation when one traveled to the east one went down the longitudinal scale toward zero at greenwich england additionally prevailing fair weather winds generally out of the southwest have been used as the basis for directional descriptions by european settlers and their descendants in eastern north america that is one would be traveling down wind to the east with a westerly wind at one's back to this day on nearby martha's vineyard up island is the western section and down island is to the east the arrival of the railroad during the nineteenth century reinforced the up/down concept as train schedules between boston and cape cod always showed boston at the top  the timetable for trains headed onto the cape would be read from the top down and those of returning trains would be read from the bottom up provincetown therefore despite being the cape's northernmost town was the furthest down that one could travel the cape's unique shape brought a new paradox along with the automobile and highway system when driving down cape on us route 6 eastbound the final 30 miles from orleans to provincetown takes one in nearly every direction except east. the best known colloquial explanation however is that the shape of the peninsula as it appears on maps and charts resembles that of a human arm in that analogy the southern portion of the cape represents the upper arm chatham the elbow and the north-south portion is the lower arm or forearm going further some say provincetown is the curled hand or fist with race point and wood end at its knuckles and long point at the fingertips in the late twentieth century as the cape began drawing more vacationers and artists on retreat the nautical nomenclature and potential confusion over directions have gradually been giving way to the simpler outer cape although the older terms are still used by some local residents geologyedit the bulk of the land on cape cod consists of glacial landforms formed by terminal moraine and outwash plains this represents the southernmost extent of glacial coverage in southeast new england similar glacial formations make up long island in new york and block island in rhode island together these formations are known as the outer lands or more obscurely as the isles of stirling geologically speaking cape cod is quite young having been laid down some 16000 to 20000 years ago most of cape cod's geological history involves the advance and retreat of the laurentide ice sheet in the late pleistocene geological era and the subsequent changes in sea level using radiocarbon dating techniques researchers have determined that around 23000 years ago the ice sheet reached its maximum southward advance over north america and then started to retreat many kettle ponds  clear cold lakes  were formed and remain on cape cod as a result of the receding glacier by about 18000 years ago the ice sheet had retreated past cape cod by roughly 15000 years ago it had retreated past southern new england when so much of earth's water was locked up in massive ice sheets the sea level was lower truro's bayside beaches used to be a petrified forest before it became a beach this process continues today due to their exposure to the open ocean the cape and islands are subject to considerable coastal erosion geologists say that due to erosion the cape will be completely submerged by the sea within several thousand years.19 this erosion causes the washout of beaches and the destruction of the barrier islands for example the ocean broke through the barrier island at chatham during hurricane bob in 1991 allowing waves and storm surges to hit the coast with no obstruction consequently the sediment and sand from the beaches is being washed away and deposited elsewhere while this destroys land in some places it creates land elsewhere most noticeably in marshes where sediment is deposited by flowing water cape cod's aquifer consists of six hydrologically independent lenses from which all the towns on the cape obtain drinking water except falmouth which got 43.5 of its 2015 water from long pond.2021 contamination with industrial chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs from septic systems is a concern.22 climateedit  native populationedit cape cod has been the home of the wampanoag native american people for many centuries they survived off the sea and were accomplished farmers they understood the principles of sustainable forest management and were known to light controlled fires to keep the underbrush in check they helped the pilgrims who arrived in the fall of 1620 survive at their new plymouth colony the wampanoag lost their lands through continued purchase and expropriation by the english colonists the documentary natives of the narrowland 1993 narrated by actress julie harris shows the history of the wampanoag people through cape cod archaeological sites in 1974 the mashpee wampanoag tribal council was formed to articulate the concerns of those with native american ancestry they petitioned the federal government in 1975 and again in 1990 for official recognition of the mashpee wampanoag as a tribe in may 2007 the wampanoag tribe was federally recognized.29 historyedit discovery by europeansedit in 1602 bartholomew gosnold named the tip cape cod the surviving term and the ninth oldest english place-name in the u.s.39 samuel de champlain charted its sand-silted harbors in 1606 and henry hudson landed there in 1609 captain john smith noted it on his map of 1614 and at last the pilgrims entered the cape harbor and  contrary to the popular myth of plymouth rock  made their first landing near present-day provincetown on november 11 1620 nearby in what is now eastham they had their first encounter with native americans settlementedit cape cod was among the first places settled by the english in north america the cape's fifteen towns developed slowly aside from barnstable 1639 sandwich 1637 and yarmouth 1639 the final town to be established on the cape was bourne in 1884 breaking off from sandwich.40 provincetown was a group of huts until the 18th century a channel from massachusetts bay to buzzards bay is shown on southack's map of 1717 the present cape cod canal was slowly developed from 1870 to 1914 the federal government purchased it in 1928 by 1800 much of cape cod's firewood had to be transported by boat from maine the paucity of vegetation was worsened by the raising of merino sheep that reached its peak in new england around 1840 the early industrial revolution occurred through much of massachusetts and rhode island but it mostly bypassed cape cod due to a lack of significant water power in the area the cape developed as a large fishing and whaling center as a result and also because of its geographic position after 1860 and the opening of the american west farmers abandoned agriculture on the cape by 1950 forests had recovered to an extent not seen since the 18th century modern eraedit cape cod became a summer haven for city dwellers beginning at the end of the 19th century improved rail transportation made the towns of the upper cape accessible to bostonians such as bourne and falmouth at the beginning of the twentieth century the northeastern mercantile elite built many large shingled cottages along buzzards bay the relaxed summer environment offered by cape cod was highlighted by writers including joseph c lincoln who published novels and countless short stories about cape cod folks in popular magazines such as the saturday evening post and the delineator guglielmo marconi made the first transatlantic wireless transmission originating in the united states from cape cod at wellfleet the beach below the bluffs where his station was located is now called marconi beach in 1914 he began construction of a new transatlantic wireless receiver station in chatham and a companion transmitter station in marion in 1920 the stations were acquired by rca and in 1921 chatham began operations as a maritime radio station communicating to ships at sea using the callsign wcc wcc supported the communications of amelia earhart howard hughes admiral byrd and the hindenburg marconi chose chatham due to its vantage point on the atlantic ocean surrounded on three sides by water walter cronkite narrated a 17-minute documentary in 2005 about the history of the chatham station much of the east-facing atlantic seacoast of cape cod consists of wide sandy beaches in 1961 a significant portion of this coastline already slated for housing subdivisions was made a part of the cape cod national seashore by president john f kennedy it was protected from private development and preserved for public use large portions are open to the public including the marconi site in wellfleet this is a park encompassing the site of the first two-way transoceanic radio transmission from the united states theodore roosevelt used marconi's equipment for this transmission. the kennedy compound in hyannis port was president kennedy's summer white house during his presidency and the kennedy family continues to maintain residences on the compound president grover cleveland maintained a summer home in the gray gables section of bourne other notable residents of cape cod have included actress julie harris us supreme court justice louis brandeis figure

were erected along cape cod to aid in navigation highland light or cape cod light is the oldest and tallest of these and remains as one of a number of working lighthouses on cape cod and the islands many of cape cod's earliest lighthouses featured a light tower that was attached directly to  and centered on the roof of  the keeper's dwelling a stairway to the lantern room was accessible only from the top floor of the house this came to be known as a cape cod style lighthouse yet today the only fully intact specimens are on the west coast of the united states.44 most of cape cod's lighthouses are operated by the u.s coast guard with some exceptions such as the nauset light which has been owned since 1997 by the cape cod national seashore national park service and operated since 2004 in partnership between that agency and the non-profit nauset light preservation society.45 the lighthouses of cape cod include transportationedit roadedit cape cod is connected to the mainland by a pair

japan archaeological research indicates that japan was inhabited as early as the upper paleolithic period the first written mention of japan is in chinese history texts from the 1st century ad influence from other regions mainly china followed by periods of isolation particularly from western europe has characterized japan's history the country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.20 although japan has officially renounced its right to declare war it maintains a modern military with the world's eighth-largest military budget21 used for self-defense and peacekeeping roles japan is a developed country with a very high standard of living and human development index its population enjoys the highest life expectancy and the third lowest infant mortality rate in the world japan is well-known internationally for its major contributions to science and modern-day technology.2223  contents  etymology history prehistory and ancient history feudal era modern era on march 31 1854 commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises the resignation of the shogun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor the meiji restoration.56 in 1947 japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in 195269 and japan was granted membership in the united nations in 1956 japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in 2010 this ended in the mid-1990s when japan suffered a major recession in the beginning of the 21st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery.70 on march 11 2011 japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.71 geography about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use.873 as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.74 the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago.75 climate the climate of japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones hokkaido sea of japan central highland seto inland sea pacific ocean and ryukyu islands the northernmost zone hokkaido has a humid continental climate with long cold winters and very warm to cool summers precipitation is not heavy but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.81 the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers precipitation is very heavy especially during the rainy season.81 biodiversity environment in the period of rapid economic growth after world war ii environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations as a result environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s responding to rising concern about the problem the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.90 the oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of japan's lack of natural resources.91 current environmental issues include urban air pollution nox suspended particulate matter and toxics waste management water eutrophication nature conservation climate change chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.92 as of june 2015 more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in japan the ngo climate action network announced japan as the winner of its fossil of the day award for doing the most to block progress on climate action.93 japan ranks 39th in the 2016 environmental performance index which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.94 as a signatory of the kyoto protocol and host of the 1997 conference that created it japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.95 politics government japan is a constitutional monarchy the emperor is a ceremonial figurehead and is defined by the constitution as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people executive power is wielded chiefly by the prime minister and his cabinet sovereignty is vested in the japanese people.96 japan's legislative body is the national diet seated in chiyoda tokyo the diet is a bicameral body comprising the lower house of representatives with 475 seats elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved and the upper house of councillors with 242 seats whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms there is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age97 with a secret ballot for all elected offices.96 the diet is dominated by the social liberal democratic party of japan dp and the conservative liberal democratic party ldp the ldp has enjoyed near-continuous electoral success since 1955 except for brief periods between 1993 and 1994 and from 2009 to 2012 as of may 2017 it holds 294 seats in the lower house and 121 seats in the upper house administrative divisions japan consists of 47 prefectures each overseen by an elected governor legislature and administrative bureaucracy.103 each prefecture is further divided into cities towns and villages.104 the nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities towns and villages with each other this process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs.105 foreign relations japan has diplomatic relations with nearly all independent nations and has been an active member of the united nations since december 1956 japan is a member of the g8 apec and asean plus three and is a participant in the east asia summit japan signed a security pact with australia in march 2007106 and with india in october 2008.107 it is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance donating us$9.2 billion in 2014.108 japan has close ties to the united states since japan's defeat by the allies in world war ii the two countries have maintained close economic and defense relations the united states is a major market for japanese exports and the primary source of japanese imports and is committed to defending the country having military bases in japan for partially that purpose.109 japan contests russia's control of the southern kuril islands including etorofu kunashiri shikotan and the habomai group which were occupied by the soviet union in 1945.110 south korea's assertions concerning liancourt rocks japanese takeshima korean dokdo are acknowledged but not accepted by japan.111 japan has strained relations with the people's republic of china prc and the republic of china roc over the senkaku islands;112 and with the people's republic of china over the status of okinotorishima military japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.117 the country's military the japan self-defense forces is restricted by article 9 of the japanese constitution which renounces japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes accordingly japan's self-defence force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside japan.118 japan is the highest-ranked asian country in the global peace index.119 the military is governed by the ministry of defense and primarily consists of the japan ground self-defense force jgsdf the japan maritime self-defense force jmsdf and the japan air self-defense force jasdf the japan maritime self-defense force jmsdf is a regular participant in rimpac maritime exercises.120 the forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations the deployment of troops to iraq marked the first overseas use of japan's military since world war ii.121 japan business federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that japan can join multinational projects such as the joint strike fighter.122 the 21st century is witnessing a rapid change in global power balance along with globalization the security environment around japan has become increasingly severe as represented by nuclear and missile development by north korea transnational threats grounded on technological progress including international terrorism and cyber attacks are also increasing their significance.123 japan including its self defense forces has contributed to the maximum extent possible to the efforts to maintain and restore international peace and security such as un peacekeeping operations building on the ongoing efforts as a peaceful state the government of japan has been making various efforts on its security policy which include the establishment of the national security council nsc the adoption of the national security strategy nss and the national defense program guidelines ndpg.123 these efforts are made based on the belief that japan as a proactive contributor to peace needs to contribute more actively to the peace and stability of the region and the international community while coordinating with other countries including its ally the united states.123 japan has close economic and military relations with the united states the us-japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy.124 a member state of the united nations since 1956 japan has served as a non-permanent security council member for a total of 20 years most recently for 2009 and 2010 it is one of the g4 nations seeking permanent membership in the security council.125 economy japan is the third largest national economy in the world after the united states and china in terms of nominal gdp132 and the fourth largest national economy in the world after the united states china and india in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2016update japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product the largest of any nation in the world.133 in august 2011 moody's rating has cut japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from aa3 to aa2 inline with the size of the country's deficit and borrowing level the large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 caused the rating downgrade.134 the service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.135 japan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles electronics machine tools steel and nonferrous metals ships chemical substances textiles and processed foods agricultural businesses in japan cultivate 13 percent of japan's land and japan accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global fish catch second only to china.8 as of 2016update japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers.8 japan has a low unemployment rate of around four percent some 20 million people around 17 per cent of the population were below the poverty line in 2007.136 housing in japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.137 japan's exports amounted to us$4210 per capita in 2005 as of 2014update japan's main export markets were the united states 20.2 percent china 17.5 percent south korea 7.1 percent hong kong 5.6 percent and thailand 4.5 percent its main exports are transportation equipment motor vehicles iron and steel products semiconductors and auto parts.8 japan's main import markets as of 2015update were china 24.8 percent the united states 10.5 percent australia 5.4 percent and south korea 4.1 percent.8 japan ranks 27th of 189 countries in the 2014 ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world the japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features keiretsu enterprises are influential and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the japanese work environment.138140 japanese companies are known for management methods like the toyota way and shareholder activism is rare.141 japan's top global brands include toyota honda canon nissan sony mitsubishi ufj mufg panasonic uniqlo lexus subaru nintendo bridgestone mazda and suzuki.142 economic history modern japan's economic growth began in the edo period some of the surviving elements of the edo period are roads and water transportation routes as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts banking and insurance of the osaka rice brokers.143 during the meiji period from 1868 japan expanded economically with the embrace of the market economy.144 many of today's enterprises were founded at the time and japan emerged as the most developed nation in asia.145 the period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the japanese post-war economic miracle it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.146 growth slowed in the 1990s during the lost decade due to after-effects of the japanese asset price bubble and government policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets efforts to revive economic growth were unsuccessful and further hampered by the global slowdown in 2000.8 the economy recovered after 2005 gdp growth for that year was 2.8 percent surpassing the growth rates of the us and european union during the same period.147 agriculture and fishery the japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4 of the total country's gdp.150 only 12 of japan's land is suitable for cultivation.151152 due to this lack of arable land a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.153 this results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50 on fewer than 56000 square kilometres 14000000 acres cultivated japan's small agricultural sector however is also highly subsidized and protected with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in north america.151 there has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.154 rice accounts for almost all of japan's cereal production.155 japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world.155 rice the most protected crop is subject to tariffs of 777.7%.152156 in 1996 japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught.157 japan captured 4074580 metric tons of fish in 2005 down from 4987703 tons in 2000 9558615 tons in 1990 9864422 tons in 1980 8520397 tons in 1970 5583796 tons in 1960 and 2881855 tons in 1950.158 in 2003 the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1301437 tonnes.159 in 2010 japan's total fisheries production was 4762469 fish.160 offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50 of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period today japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global catch161 prompting some claims that japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.162 japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.163 industry japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5 of its gdp.164 japan's major industries are motor vehicles electronics machine tools metals ships chemicals and processed foods some major japanese industrial companies include toyota canon inc. toshiba and nippon steel.164165 japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world and is home to toyota the world's largest automobile company.166167 the japanese consumer electronics industry once considered the strongest in the world is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like south korea the united states and china.168169 however despite also facing similar competition from south korea and china the japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong due to an increased focus on specialized high-tech designs.170 services tourism japan attracted 19.73 million international tourists in 2015176 and increased by 21.8 to attracted 24.03 million international tourists in 2016.177178179 tourism from abroad is one of the few promising businesses in japan foreign visitors to japan doubled in last decade and reached 10 million people for the first time in 2013 led by increase of asian visitors in 2008 the japanese government has set up japan tourism agency and set the initial goal to increase foreign visitors to 20 million in 2020 in 2016 having met the 20 million target the government has revised up its target to 40 million by 2020 and to 60 million by 2030.180181 japan has 20 world heritage sites including himeji castle historic monuments of ancient kyoto and nara.182 popular tourist attractions include tokyo and hiroshima mount fuji ski resorts such as niseko in hokkaido okinawa riding the shinkansen and taking advantage of japan's hotel and hotspring network for inbound tourism japan was ranked 16th in the world in 2015.183 in 2009 the yomiuri shimbun published a modern list of famous sights under the name heisei hyakkei the hundred views of the heisei period the travel and tourism competitiveness report 2017 ranks japan 4th out of 141 countries overall which was the best in asia japan gained relatively high scores in almost all aspects especially health and hygiene safety and security cultural resources and business travel.184 in 2016 24039053 foreign tourists visited japan.185 neighbouring south korea is japan's most important source of foreign tourists in 2010 the 2.4 million arrivals made up 27 of the tourists visiting japan.186 chinese travelers are the highest spenders in japan by country spending an estimated 196.4 billion yen us$2.4 billion in 2011 or almost a quarter of total expenditure by foreign visitors according to data from the japan tourism agency.187 the japanese government hopes to receive 40 million foreign tourists every year by 2020.188 science and technology japan is a leading nation in scientific research particularly in fields related to the natural sciences and engineering the country ranks second among the most innovative countries in the bloomberg innovation index.189190 nearly 700000 researchers share a us$130 billion research and development budget.191 the amount spent on research and development relative to its gross domestic product third highest in the world.192 the country is a world leader in fundamental scientific research having produced twenty-two nobel laureates in either physics chemistry or medicine193 and three fields medalists.194 electronics and automotive engineering the japanese electronics and automotive manufacturing industry is well known throughout the world and the country's electronic and automotive products account for a large share in the global market compared to a majority of other countries brands such as fujifilm sony nintendo panasonic toyota nissan and honda are internationally famous it is estimated that 16 of the world's gold and 22 of the world's silver is contained in japanese electronics.201 japan has started a project to build the world's fastest supercomputer by the end of 2017 aerospace the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa is japan's space agency it conducts space planetary and aviation research and leads development of rockets and satellites it is a participant in the international space station the japanese experiment module kibo was added to the station during space shuttle assembly flights in 2008.202 the space probe akatsuki was launched may 20 2010 and achieved orbit around venus on december 9 2015 japan's plans in space exploration include developing the mercury magnetospheric orbiter to be launched in 2016;203 and building a moon base by 2030.204 nobel laureates infrastructure transportation since privatisation in 1987 dozens of japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets major companies include seven jr enterprises kintetsu seibu railway and keio corporation some 250 high-speed shinkansen trains connect major cities and japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality.217218 proposals for a new maglev route between tokyo and osaka are at an advanced stage.219 energy as of 2011update 46.1 of energy in japan was produced from petroleum 21.3 from coal 21.4 from natural gas 4.0 from nuclear power and 3.3 from hydropower nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of japan's electricity as of 2011update down from 24.9 percent the previous year.223 however by may 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in march 2011 though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service.224 as of november 2014update two reactors at sendai are likely to restart in early 2015.225 japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy.226 japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.227 water supply and sanitation the government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the ministry of health labor and welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation the ministry of the environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation and the ministry of internal affairs and communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.228 access to an improved water source is universal in japan 97 of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3 receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems mainly in rural areas.229 water supply and sanitation in japan is facing some challenges such as a decreasing population declining investment fiscal constraints ageing facilities an ageing workforce a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities and the vulnerability of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change demographics population religion religion in japan data from 20009 shinto is the largest religion in japan practiced by nearly 80 of the population yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as shintoists in surveys this is due to the fact that shinto has different meanings in japan most of the japanese attend shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to shinto organisations and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk shinto shinto membership is often estimated counting those who join organised shinto sects shinto has 100000 shrines and 78890 priests in the country.250 buddhism first arrived in japan in the 6th century it was introduced in the year 538 or 552251 from the kingdom of baekje in korea.251 christianity was first introduced into japan by jesuit missions starting in 1549.252 today fewer than 1%253254255 to 2.3 are christians.note 2 most of them living in the western part of the country where the missionaries activities were greatest during the 16th century nagasaki prefecture has the highest percentage of christians about 5.1 in 1996.256 as of 2007update there are 32036 christian priests and pastors in japan.250 throughout the latest century some western customs originally related to christianity including western style weddings valentine's day and christmas have become popular as secular customs among many japanese.257 other minority religions include hinduism sikhism and judaism and since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in japan.261 languages more than 99 percent of the population speaks japanese as their first language.8 japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of japanese society with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener japanese writing uses kanji chinese characters and two sets of kana syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji as well as the latin alphabet and arabic numerals.262 besides japanese the ryukyuan languages amami kunigami okinawan miyako yaeyama yonaguni also part of the japonic language family are spoken in the ryukyu islands chain few children learn these languages263 but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages the okinawan japanese dialect is also spoken in the region the ainu language which has no proven relationship to japanese or any other language is moribund with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in hokkaido.264 public and private schools generally require students to take japanese language classes as well as english language courses.265266 problems the changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits like the public pension plan.267 a growing number of younger japanese are not marrying or remain childless.268 in 2011 japan's population dropped for a fifth year falling by 204000 people to 126.24 million people this was the greatest decline since at least 1947 when comparable figures were first compiled.269 this decline was made worse by the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami which killed nearly 16000 people.270 japan suffers from a high suicide rate.277278 in 2009 the number of suicides exceeded 30000 for the twelfth straight year.279 suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30.280 education primary schools secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the meiji restoration.281 since 1947 compulsory education in japan comprises elementary and middle school which together last for nine years from age 6 to age 15 almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery and rapid economic growth in the decades following the end of world war ii after world war ii the fundamental law of education and the school education law were enacted the latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades six years of elementary school three years of junior high school three years of high school and two or four years of university starting in april 2016 various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy mext plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years.282 in japan having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce the lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained furthermore skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in japan's highly technological economy.283 the two top-ranking universities in japan are the university of tokyo and kyoto university.287288 created 16 nobel prize laureates the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the oecd currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of japanese 15-year-olds as sixth best in the world.289 health in japan health care is provided by national and local governments payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access with fees set by a government committee people without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments since 1973 all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.290 patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.291 culture japanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins contemporary culture combines influences from asia europe and north america traditional japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics textiles lacquerware swords and dolls performances of bunraku kabuki noh dance and rakugo and other practices the tea ceremony ikebana martial arts calligraphy origami onsen geisha and games japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible cultural properties and national treasures.292 nineteen sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list fifteen of which are of cultural significance.89 architecture japanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences it has traditionally been typified by wooden structures elevated slightly off the ground with tiled or thatched roofs sliding doors fusuma were used in place of walls allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions people usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor traditionally chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century since the 19th century however japan has incorporated much of western modern and post-modern architecture into construction and design and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology the introduction of buddhism during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood influence from the chinese tang and sui dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in nara its checkerboard street layout used the chinese capital of chang'an as a template for its design a gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design the introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy during the meiji restoration of 1868 the history of japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events the first was the kami and buddhas separation act of 1868 which formally separated buddhism from shinto and buddhist temples from shinto shrines breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years.293 second it was then that japan underwent a period of intense westernization in order to compete with other developed countries initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style architects returning from study with western architects introduced the international style of modernism into japan however it was not until after the second world war that japanese architects made an impression on the international scene firstly with the work of architects like kenzo tange and then with theoretical movements like metabolism art the shrines of ise have been celebrated as the prototype of japanese architecture.294 largely of wood traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.295 japanese sculpture largely of wood and japanese painting are among the oldest of the japanese arts with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 bc the history of japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.296 the interaction between japanese and european art has been significant for example ukiyo-e prints which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as japonism had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the west most notably on post-impressionism.296 famous ukiyo-e artists include hokusai and hiroshige hokusai coined the term manga japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.297 japanese animation is called anime japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s.298 hirado ware porcelain censers in the form of tiger and figurine with fan brown and blue glazes 19th-century ukiyo-e woodblock print the great wave off kanagawa an anime store in akihabara tokyo animation japanese animated films such as anime which was largely influenced by japanese manga and originally made up of animated cartoon works are popular japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.299 music japanese music is eclectic and diverse many instruments such as the koto were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries the accompanied recitative of the noh drama dates from the 14th century and the popular folk music with the guitar-like shamisen from the sixteenth.300 western classical music introduced in the late 19th century now forms an integral part of japanese culture the imperial court ensemble gagaku has influenced the work of some modern western composers.301 literature philosophy japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign particularly chinese and western and uniquely japanese elements in its literary forms japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago confucianism entered japan from china around the 5th century a.d. as did buddhism.311 confucian ideals are still evident today in the japanese concept of society and the self and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.311 buddhism has profoundly impacted japanese psychology metaphysics and aesthetics.312 indigenous ideas of loyalty and honour have been held since the 16th century western philosophy has had its major impact in japan only since the middle of the 19th century cuisine traditional japanese sweets are known as wagashi ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used more modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream a very popular flavor almost all manufacturers produce a version of it kakigori is a shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup or condensed milk it is usually sold and eaten at summer festivals popular japanese beverages such as sake which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 15%~17 alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice beer has been brewed in japan since the late 1800s and is produced in many regions by companies including asahi breweries kirin brewery and sapporo brewery  the oldest brand of beer in japan the michelin guide has awarded restaurants in japan more michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.315 holidays festivals sports traditionally sumo is considered japan's national sport.321 japanese martial arts such as judo karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by

korea korea is a historical country in east asia since 1945 it has been divided into two distinct sovereign states north korea officially the democratic people's republic of korea and south korea officially the republic of korea located on the korean peninsula korea is bordered by china to the northwest and russia to the northeast it is separated from japan to the east by the korea strait and the sea of japan east sea the first 200 years of joseon were marked by relative peace during this period the korean alphabet was created by sejong the great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of confucianism during the later part of the dynasty korea's isolationist policy earned it the western nickname of the hermit kingdom by the late 19th century the country became the object of imperial design by the empire of japan after the first sino-japanese war despite the korean empire's effort to modernize it was annexed by japan in 1910 and ruled by imperial japan until the end of world war ii in august 1945 in 1945 the soviet union and the united states agreed on the surrender of japanese forces in korea in the aftermath of world war ii leaving korea partitioned along the 38th parallel the north was under soviet occupation and the south under u.s occupation these circumstances soon became the basis for the division of korea by the two superpowers exacerbated by their incapability to agree on the terms of korean independence the communist-inspired government in the north received backing from the soviet union in opposition to the pro-western government in the south leading to korea's division into two political entities north korea formally the democratic people's republic of korea and south korea formally the republic of korea tensions between the two resulted in the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 with involvement by foreign troops the war ended in a stalemate in 1953 but without a formalized peace treaty this status contributes to the high tensions that continue to divide the peninsula to date each country contends that it is the sole legitimate government of all of korea they refuse to recognize the other as legitimate  contents  etymology history prehistory and gojoseon this time period saw numerous states spring up from the former territories of gojoseon which encompassed northern korea and southern manchuria with the fall of gojoseon southern korea entered the samhan period located in the southern part of the korean peninsula samhan refers to the three confederacies of mahan jinhan and byeonhan mahan was the largest and consisted of 54 states byeonhan and jinhan both consisted of twelve states bringing a total of 78 states within the samhan these three confederacies eventually developed into baekje silla and gaya three kingdoms the three kingdoms of korea consisted of goguryeo silla and baekje silla and baekje controlled the southern half of the korean peninsula maintaining the former samhan territories while goguryeo controlled the northern half of the korean peninsula manchuria and the liaodong peninsula uniting buyeo okjeo dongye and other states in the former gojoseon territories.17 goguryeo was a highly militaristic state;1819 it was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in east asia20212223 reaching its zenith in the 5th century when its territories expanded to encompass most of manchuria to the north parts of inner mongolia to the west24 parts of russia to the east25 and the seoul region to the south.26 goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son jangsu27282930 who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean peninsula.3132 in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties33 most notably the goguryeo-sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.3435363738 in 642 the powerful general yeon gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over goguryeo in response emperor tang taizong of china led a campaign against goguryeo but was defeated and retreated.3940 after the death of tang taizong his son emperor tang gaozong allied with the korean kingdom of silla and invaded goguryeo again but was unable to overcome goguryeo's stalwart defenses and was defeated in 662.4142 however yeon gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother with his eldest son defecting to tang and his younger brother defecting to silla.4344 the tang-silla alliance finally conquered goguryeo in 668 after the collapse of goguryeo tang and silla ended their alliance and fought over control of the korean peninsula silla succeeded in gaining control over most of the korean peninsula while tang gained control over goguryeo's northern territories however 30 years after the fall of goguryeo a goguryeo general by the name of dae joyeong founded the korean-mohe state of balhae and successfully expelled the tang presence from much of the former goguryeo territories the southwestern korean kingdom of baekje was founded around modern-day seoul by a goguryeo prince a son of the founder of goguryeo.454647 baekje absorbed all of the mahan states and subjugated most of the western korean peninsula including the modern provinces of gyeonggi chungcheong and jeolla as well as parts of hwanghae and gangwon to a centralised government during the expansion of its territory baekje acquired chinese culture and technology through maritime contacts with the southern dynasties baekje was a great maritime power;48 its nautical skill which made it the phoenicia of east asia was instrumental in the dissemination of buddhism throughout east asia and continental culture to japan.4950 historic evidence suggests that japanese culture art and language were influenced by the kingdom of baekje and korea itself;235152535455565758596061 baekje also played an important role in transmitting advanced chinese culture to the japanese archipelago baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula most notably in the 4th century during the rule of geunchogo when its influence extended across the sea to liaoxi and shandong in china taking advantage of the weakened state of former qin and kyushu in the japanese archipelago;62 however baekje was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined.63 although later records claim that silla was the oldest of the three kingdoms of korea it is now believed to have been the last kingdom to develop by the 2nd century silla existed as a large state in the southeast occupying and influencing its neighboring city-states in 562 silla annexed the gaya confederacy which was located between baekje and silla the three kingdoms of korea often warred with each other and silla was often dominated by baekje and goguryeo silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantage.6465 in 660 king muyeol ordered his armies to attack baekje general kim yu-shin aided by tang forces conquered baekje after defeating general gyebaek at the battle of hwangsanbeol in 661 silla and tang attacked goguryeo but were repelled king munmu son of muyeol and nephew of general kim yu-shin launched another campaign in 667 and goguryeo fell in the following year north-south states period beginning in the 6th century silla's power gradually extended across the korean peninsula silla first annexed the adjacent gaya confederacy in 562 by the 640s silla formed an alliance with the tang dynasty of china to conquer baekje and later goguryeo after conquering baekje and goguryeo silla repulsed tang china from the korean peninsula in 676 even though silla unified most of the korean peninsula most of the goguryeo territories to the north of the korean peninsula were ruled by balhae former goguryeo general dae jo-yeong led a group of goguryeo and mohe refugees to the jilin and founded the kingdom of balhae 30 years after the collapse of goguryeo as the successor to goguryeo at its height balhae's territories extended from southern manchuria down to the northern korean peninsula balhae was called the prosperous country in the east.66 later silla carried on the maritime prowess of baekje which acted like the phoenicia of medieval east asia67 and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of east asia and the trade between china korea and japan most notably during the time of jang bogo in addition silla people made overseas communities in china on the shandong peninsula and the mouth of the yangtze river.68697071 later silla was a prosperous and wealthy country72 and its metropolitan capital of gyeongju73 was the fourth largest city in the world.74757677 later silla was a golden age of art and culture78798081 as evidenced by the hwangnyongsa seokguram and emille bell buddhism flourished during this time and many korean buddhists gained great fame among chinese buddhists82 and contributed to chinese buddhism83 including woncheuk wonhyo uisang musang84858687 and kim gyo-gak a silla prince whose influence made mount jiuhua one of the four sacred mountains of chinese buddhism.8889909192 goryeo dynasty during this period laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula the development of celadon industries flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries the publication of the tripitaka koreana onto more than 80000 wooden blocks and the invention of the world's first metal movable type in the 13th century attest to goryeo's cultural achievements.456789 after defeating the khitan empire which was the most powerful empire of its time101102 goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century during which the tripitaka koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy literature religion and science by 1100 there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists.103104 goryeo was invaded by the mongols in seven major campaigns from the 1230s until the 1270s but was never conquered.105 exhausted after decades of fighting goryeo sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to the mongols kublai khan accepted and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince105 and the dynastic line of goryeo continued to survive under the overlordship of the mongol yuan dynasty as a semi-autonomous vassal state and compulsory ally the two nations became intertwined for 80 years as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses105 and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess.106 in the 1350s king gongmin was free at last to reform the goryeo government when the yuan dynasty began to crumble gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with which included the removal of pro-mongol aristocrats and military officials the question of land holding and quelling the growing animosity between the buddhists and confucian scholars during this tumultuous period goryeo momentarily conquered liaoyang in 1356 repulsed two large invasions by the red turbans in 1359 and 1360 and defeated the final attempt by the yuan to dominate goryeo when general choe yeong defeated a mongol tumen in 1364 during the 1380s goryeo turned its attention to the wokou threat and used naval artillery created by choe museon to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships joseon dynasty in 1392 the general yi seong-gye overthrew the goryeo dynasty after he staged a coup and defeated general choe yeong yi seong-gye named his new dynasty joseon and moved the capital from kaesong to hanseong formerly hanyang modern-day seoul and built the gyeongbokgung palace.107 in 1394 he adopted confucianism as the country's official ideology resulting in much loss of power and wealth by the buddhists the prevailing philosophy of the joseon dynasty was neo-confucianism which was epitomized by the seonbi class scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity joseon was a nominal tributary state of china but exercised full sovereignty108109 and maintained the highest position among china's tributary states110111 which also included countries such as the ryukyu kingdom vietnam thailand112113114 the philippines burma laos among others.115116 in addition joseon received tribute from jurchens and japanese until the 17th century117118119 and had a small enclave in the ryukyu kingdom that engaged in trade with siam and java.120 after normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace kings yeongjo and jeongjo led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the 18th century.129130 in the 19th century the royal in-law families gained control of the government leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country furthermore the joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy earning the nickname the hermit kingdom but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders beginning an era leading into japanese imperial rule korean empire japanese occupation and japan-korea annexation in 1910 an already militarily occupied korea was a forced party to the japan-korea annexation treaty the treaty was signed by lee wan-yong who was given the general power of attorney by the emperor however the emperor is said to have not actually ratified the treaty according to yi tae-jin.132 there is a long dispute whether this treaty was legal or illegal due to its signing under duress threat of force and bribes korean resistance to the brutal japanese occupation133134135 was manifested in the nonviolent march 1st movement of 1919 during which 7000 demonstrators were killed by japanese police and military.136 the korean liberation movement also spread to neighbouring manchuria and siberia over five million koreans were conscripted for labour beginning in 1939137 and tens of thousands of men were forced into japan's military.138 nearly 400000 korean labourers died.139 approximately 200000 girls and women140 mostly from china and korea were forced into sexual slavery for the japanese military.141 in 1993 japanese chief cabinet secretary yohei kono acknowledged the terrible injustices faced by these euphemistically named comfort women.142143 there was a significant level of emigration to the overseas territories of the empire of japan during the japanese occupation period including korea.150 by the end of world war ii there were over 850000 japanese settlers in korea.151 after world war ii most of these overseas japanese repatriated to japan division in 1945 with the surrender of japan the united nations developed plans for a trusteeship administration the soviet union administering the peninsula north of the 38th parallel and the united states administering the south the politics of the cold war resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate governments north korea and south korea the aftermath of world war ii left korea partitioned along the 38th parallel with the north under soviet occupation and the south under us occupation supported by other allied states consequently the democratic people's republic of korea a soviet-style socialist republic was established in the north while the republic of korea a western-style regime was established in the south since the 1960s the south korean economy has grown enormously and the economic structure was radically transformed in 1957 south korea had a lower per capita gdp than ghana152 and by 2008 it was 17 times as high as ghana's.a north korea officially the democratic people's republic of korea is a one-party state now centred on kim il-sung's juche ideology with a centrally planned industrial economy south korea officially the republic of korea is a multi-party state with a capitalist market economy alongside membership in the organisation for economic co-operation and development and the group of twenty the two states have greatly diverged both culturally and economically since their partition though they still share a common traditional culture and pre-cold war history according to r.j rummel forced labor executions and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in north korea from 1948 to 1987;154 others have estimated 400000 deaths in concentration camps alone.155 estimates based on the most recent north korean census suggest that 240000 to 420000 people died as a result of the 1990s famine and that there were 600000 to 850000 unnatural deaths in north korea from 1993 to 2008.156 korean war the korean war broke out when soviet-backed north korea invaded south korea though neither side gained much territory as a result the korean peninsula remained divided the korean demilitarized zone being the de facto border between the two states  geography korea is located on the korean peninsula in east asia to the northwest the amnok river separates korea from china and to the northeast the duman river separates korea from china and russia the peninsula is surrounded by the yellow sea to the west the east china sea and korea strait to the south and the east sea sea of japan .158 notable islands include jeju island ulleung island dokdo because the mountainous region is mostly on the eastern part of the peninsula the main rivers tend to flow westwards two exceptions are the southward-flowing nakdong river and seomjin river important rivers running westward include the amnok river the chongchon river the taedong river the han river the geum river and the yeongsan river these rivers have vast flood plains and provide an ideal environment for wet-rice cultivation wildlife animal life of korea includes a considerable number of bird species and native freshwater fish native or endemic species of the korean peninsula include korean hare korean water deer korean field mouse korean brown frog korean pine and korean spruce the korean demilitarized zone dmz with its forest and natural wetlands is a unique biodiversity spot which harbours eighty two endangered species there are also approximately 3034 species of vascular plants demographics the combined population of the koreans is about 76 million north korea 25 million south korea 51 million korea is chiefly populated by a highly homogeneous ethnic group the koreans who speak the korean language.159 the number of foreigners living in korea has also steadily increased since the late 20th century particularly in south korea where more than 1 million foreigners reside.160 it was estimated in 2006 that only 26700 of the old chinese community now remain in south korea.161 however in recent years immigration from mainland china has increased 624994 persons of chinese nationality have immigrated to south korea including 443566 of ethnic korean descent.162 small communities of ethnic chinese and japanese are also found in north korea.163 language korean is the official language of both north and south korea and along with mandarin of yanbian korean autonomous prefecture in the manchuria area of china worldwide there are up to 80 million speakers of the korean language south korea has around 50 million speakers while north korea around 25 million other large groups of korean speakers through korean diaspora are found in china the united states japan former soviet union and elsewhere the classification of korean is debated some linguists place it in the altaic language family others consider it to be a language isolate korean is agglutinative in its morphology and sov in its syntax like japanese and vietnamese korean has borrowed much vocabulary from the chinese or created vocabulary on chinese models modern korean is written almost exclusively in the script of the korean alphabet known as hangul in south korea and chosungul in china and north korea which was invented in the 15th century korean is sometimes written with the addition of some chinese characters called hanja however this is only occasionally seen nowadays while hangul may appear logographic it is actually a phonemic alphabet organised into syllabic blocks each block consists of at least two of the 24 hangul letters jamo at least one each of the 14 consonants and 10 vowels historically the alphabet had several additional letters see obsolete jamo for a phonological description of the letters see korean phonology culture and arts literature modern literature is often linked with the development of hangul which helped spread literacy from the aristocracy to the common men and women hangul however only reached a dominant position in korean literature in the second half of the 19th century resulting in a major growth in korean literature sinsoseol for instance are novels written in hangul the korean war led to the development of literature centered on the wounds and chaos of war much of the post-war literature in south korea deals with the daily lives of ordinary people and their struggles with national pain the collapse of the traditional korean value system is another common theme of the time music traditional korean music includes combinations of the folk vocal religious and ritual music styles of the korean people korean music has been practiced since prehistoric times.165 korean music falls into two broad categories the first hyangak literally means the local music or music native to korea of which example is sujecheon a piece of instrumental music as old as 1300 years.166 the second yangak represent a more western style religion confucian tradition has dominated korean thought along with contributions by buddhism taoism and korean shamanism since the middle of the 20th century however christianity has competed with buddhism in south korea while religious practice has been suppressed in north korea throughout korean history and culture regardless of separation the influence of traditional beliefs of korean shamanism mahayana buddhism confucianism and taoism have remained an underlying religion of the korean people as well as a vital aspect of their culture all these traditions have coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years up to today despite strong westernisation from christian missionary conversions in the south167168169 or the pressure from the juche government in the north.170171 according to 2005 statistics compiled by the south korean government about 46 of citizens profess to follow no particular religion christians account for 29.2 of the population of which are protestants 18.3 and catholics 10.9% and buddhists 22.8%.172 islam in south korea is practiced by about 45000 natives about 0.09 of the population in addition to some 100000 foreign workers from muslim countries.173 cuisine koreans traditionally believe that the taste and quality of food depend on its spices and sauces the essential ingredients to making a delicious meal therefore soybean paste soy sauce gochujang or red pepper paste and kimchi are some of the most important staples in a korean household korean cuisine was greatly influenced by the geography and climate of the korean peninsula which is known for its cold autumns and winters therefore there are many fermented dishes and hot soups and stews korean cuisine is probably best known for kimchi a side dish which uses a distinctive fermentation process of preserving vegetables most commonly cabbage kimchi is said to relieve the pores on the skin thereby reducing wrinkles and providing nutrients to the skin naturally it is also healthy as it provides necessary vitamins and nutrients gochujang a traditional korean sauce made of red pepper is also commonly used often as pepper chilli paste earning the cuisine a reputation for spiciness bulgogi roasted marinated meat usually beef galbi marinated grilled short ribs and samgyeopsal pork belly are popular meat entrees fish is also a popular commodity as it is the traditional meat that koreans eat meals are usually accompanied by a soup or stew such as galbitang stewed ribs or doenjang jjigae fermented bean paste soup the center of the table is filled with a shared collection of sidedishes called banchan other popular dishes include bibimbap which literally means mixed rice rice mixed with meat vegetables and red pepper paste and naengmyeon cold noodles.174175 instant noodles or ramyeon are a popular snack food and koreans also enjoy food from pojangmachas street vendors where customers can buy tteokbokki rice cake and fish cake with a spicy gochujang sauce gimbap made of steamed white rice wrapped in dried laver seaweed as well as fried squid and glazed sweet potato soondae a sausage made of cellophane noodles and pork blood is widely eaten additionally some other common snacks include choco pie shrimp crackers bbeongtwigi puffed rice grains and nurungji slightly burnt rice nurungji can be eaten as it is or boiled with water to make a soup nurungji can also be eaten as a snack or a dessert korea is unique among asian countries in its use of metal chopsticks metal chopsticks have been discovered in archaeological sites belonging to the ancient korean kingdoms of goguryeo baekje and silla television education the modern south korean school system consists of six years in elementary school three years in middle school and three years in high school students are required to go to elementary and middle school and do not have to pay for their education except for a small fee called a school operation support fee that differs from school to school the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the oecd ranks south korea's science education as the third best in the world and being significantly higher than the oecd average.177 the north korean education system consists primarily of universal and state funded schooling by the government the national literacy rate for citizens 15 years of age and above is over 99 percent.178179 children go through one year of kindergarten four years of primary education six years of secondary education and then on to universities the most prestigious university in the dprk is kim il-sung university other notable universities include kim chaek university of technology which focuses on computer science pyongyang university of foreign studies which trains working level diplomats and trade officials and kim hyong jik university which trains teachers outside the formal structure of schools and classrooms in the north is the extremely important social education this education includes not only extracurricular activities but also family life and the broadest range of human relationships within society there is great sensitivity to the influence of the social environment on the growing child and its role in the development of his or her character the ideal of social education is to provide a carefully controlled environment in which children are exposed only to pro-juche and anti-south influences according to a north korean official interviewed in 1990 'school education is not enough to turn the rising generation into men of knowledge virtue and physical fitness after school our children have many spare hours so it's important to efficiently organise their afterschool education' science and technology during the goryeo dynasty metal movable type printing was invented by choe yun-ui in 1234.181182183184185186 this invention made printing easier more efficient and also increased literacy which observed by chinese visitors was seen to be so important where it was considered to be shameful to not be able to read.187 the mongol empire later adopted korea's movable type printing and spread as far as central asia there is conjecture as to whether or not choe's invention had any influence on later printing inventions such as gutenberg's printing press.188 when the mongols invaded europe they inadvertently introduced different kinds of asian technology.citation needed the korean alphabet hangul was also invented during this time by king sejong the great sport while association football remains one of the most popular sports in south korea the martial art of taekwondo is considered to be the national sport baseball and golf are also popular taekwondo taekwondo is one of korea's most famous sports it combines combat techniques self-defense sport exercise and in some cases meditation and philosophy taekwondo has become an official olympic sport starting as a demonstration event in 1988 when south korea hosted the games in seoul and becoming an official medal event in 2000 there are two main authoritative taekwondo organizations in the world one is world taekwondo formerly world taekwondo federation and the larger of the two and the other is itf international taekwondo federation hapkido hapkido is a modern korean martial art with a grappling focus that employs joint locks throws kicks punches and other striking attacks like attacks against pressure points hapkido emphasizes circular motion non-resisting movements and control of the opponent practitioners seek to gain advantage through footwork and body positioning to employ leverage avoiding the pure use of strength against strength ssireum ssireum competitions are traditionally held twice a year during the dano festival the 5th day of the fifth lunar month and chuseok the 15th day of the 8th lunar month competitions are also held throughout the year as a part of festivals and other events notable public holidays in south korea independence movement day march 1st memorial day june 6th hyunchoongil is the national holiday in korea commemorating those who fought and died for the nation in august 1948 only a few years after korea achieved its independence from japan the korean war in korea also known as the 6.25 war broke out between north and south korea during this war approximately 400000 soldiers and some one million citizens were killed or injured in 1953 north and south korea agreed to a cease-fire and three years later the korean government established hyungchoogil to commemorate the soldiers who fought in the korean war subsequent to its establishment hyungchoogil was reinterpreted as a day of remembrance for those who died defending korea in all conflicts not only during the korean war national liberation day august 15th gwangbokjeol is the day for celebrating liberation of the country from japan in 1945 as well as celebrating the establishment of korean government in 1948 gwangbok means returned light

diplomatic envoys from many countries and all social standings in countries to cheongwadae the blue house the korean presidential residence hangul day october 9th hangul day also spelled as hangeul day is a day that celebrates the creation of the hunminjeongeum hangul korean alphabet which was inscribed to the unesco memory of the world register in 1997.192 hangul was created by sejong the great in 1443 and proclaimed in 1446 before the creation of hangul people in korea known as joseon at the time primarily wrote using classical chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate hangul by hundreds of years including idu hyangchal gugyeol and gakpil.193194195196 however due to the fundamental differences between the korean and chinese languages and the large number of characters needed to be learned there was much difficulty in learning how to write using chinese characters for the lower classes who often didn't have the privilege of education to assuage this problem king sejong created the unique alphabet known as hangul to promote literacy among the common people.197 hangul day was founded in 1926 during the japanese occupation by members of the korean language society whose goal was to preserve the korean language during a time of rapid forced japanization.198 today both south korea and north korea celebrate hangul day as a national holiday see

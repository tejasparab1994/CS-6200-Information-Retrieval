soyuz spacecraft  contents  historyedit designedit a soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts from front to back the orbital and service modules are single-use and are destroyed upon re-entry in the atmosphere the orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space soyuz can carry up to three crew members and provide life support for about 30 person days the life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures the atmosphere is regenerated through ko2 cylinders which absorb most of the co2 and water produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen and lioh cylinders which absorb leftover co2 the vehicle is protected during launch by a payload fairing which is jettisoned along with the sas at 2-1/2 minutes into launch it has an automatic docking system the ship can be operated automatically or by a pilot independently of ground control launch escape systemedit since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the soyuz service module cleanly the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort four folding stabilizers were added to improve aerodynamic stability during ascent two test runs of the sas were carried out in 1966-67.8 the basic design of the sas has remained almost unchanged in 50 years of use and all soyuz launches carry it the only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the sas motor nozzles was deleted for weight-saving reasons as the redesigned soyuz 7k-t spacecraft carried extra life support equipment the unmanned progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and deletes the stabilizer fins from the payload shroud there have been two failed launches of a manned soyuz vehicle soyuz 18-1 in 1975 and soyuz t-10-1 in 1983 but the former was aborted after escape tower jettison the latter successfully rescued the cosmonauts from an on-pad fire and explosion of the launch vehicle.9 this is the only time a launch escape tower has been used in an abort with a crew aboard orbital moduleedit a hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed crew members exiting through its side port near the descent module on the launch pad the crew enter the spacecraft through this port this separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module the convention of orientation in a micro-g environment differs from that of the descent module as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the sas system is complicated because of the orbital module separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing without separation of the orbital module it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module in view of this the orbital module was separated before the ignition of the return engine until the late 1980s this guaranteed that the descent module and orbital module would be separated before the descent module was placed in a reentry trajectory however after the problematic landing of soyuz tm-5 in september 1988 this procedure was changed and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver this change was made as the tm-5 crew could not deorbit for 24 hours after they jettisoned their orbital module which contained their sanitation facilities and the docking collar needed to attach to mir the risk of not being able to separate the orbital module is effectively judged to be less than the risk of needing the facilities in it following a failed deorbit descent moduleedit service moduleedit re-entry procedureedit the soyuz uses a method similar to the apollo to deorbit itself the spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for deorbiting fully 180 ahead of its planned landing site this requires the least propellant for re-entry the spacecraft travels on an elliptical hohmann orbit to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter early soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module as they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation later soyuz spacecraft detached the orbital module before firing the main engine which saved propellant since the soyuz tm-5 landing issue the orbital module is once again detached only after the re-enter firing which led to but did not cause emergency situations of soyuz tma-10 and tma-11 the orbital module cannot remain in orbit as an addition to a space station as the airlock hatch between the orbital and reentry modules is a part of the reentry module and the orbital module therefore depressurizes after separation re-entry firing is usually done on the dawn side of the earth so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the earth the soyuz craft is designed to come down on land usually somewhere in the deserts of kazakhstan in central asia this is in contrast to early us manned missions which splashed down in the ocean spacecraft systemsedit variantsedit the soyuz spacecraft has been the subject of continuous evolution since the early 1960s thus several different versions proposals and projects exist specificationsedit soyuz 7k part of the 7k-9k-11k circumlunar complex 1963edit sergei korolev initially promoted the soyuz a-b-v circumlunar complex 7k-9k-11k concept also known as l1 in which a two-man craft soyuz 7k would rendezvous with other components 9k and 11k in earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle the components being delivered by the proven r-7 rocket first generationedit the next manned version of the soyuz was the soyuz 7k-oks it was designed for space station flights and had a docking port that allowed internal transfer between spacecraft the soyuz 7k-oks had two manned flights both in 1971 soyuz 11 the second flight depressurized upon re-entry killing its three-man crew second generationedit it was developed out of the military soyuz concepts studied in previous years and was capable of carrying 2 cosmonauts with sokol space suits after the soyuz 11 accident several models were planned but none actually flew in space these versions were named soyuz p soyuz ppk soyuz r soyuz 7k-vi and soyuz ois orbital research station the soyuz 7k-t/a9 version was used for the flights to the military almaz space station soyuz 7k-tm was the spacecraft used in the apollo-soyuz test project in 1975 which saw the first and only docking of a soyuz spacecraft with an apollo command/service module it was also flown in 1976 for the earth-science mission soyuz 22 soyuz 7k-tm served as a technological bridge to the third generation third generationedit fourth generationedit the soyuz tma-m was an upgrade of the baseline soyuz-tma using a new computer digital interior displays updated docking equipment and the vehicle's total mass was reduced by 70 kilograms the new version debuted on 7 october 2010 with the launch of tma-01m carrying the iss expedition 25 crew.11 the soyuz tma-08m mission set a new record for the fastest manned docking with a space station event utilized the new six-hour fast rendezvous instead of the previous soyuz launches which had since 1986 taken two days.12 soyuz

ms-02 spacecraft had its maiden flight on october 19 2016 to launch expedition 49-50 from baikonur with three crew members.18 related craftedit the unmanned progress spacecraft were derived from soyuz

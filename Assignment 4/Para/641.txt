pascal unit the pascal symbol pa is the si derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure stress young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength it is defined as one newton per square metre.1 it is named after the french polymath blaise pascal  contents  etymologyedit the unit is named after blaise pascal noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics and experiments with a barometer the name pascal was adopted for the si unit newton per square metre n/m2 by the 14th general conference on weights and measures in 1971.3 definitionedit the pascal can be expressed using si derived units or alternatively solely si base units as where n is the newton m is the metre kg is the kilogram and s is the second.4 one pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre miscellaneousedit the unicode computer character set has dedicated symbols u+33a9  square pa and u+33aa  square kpa in the cjk compatibility block but these exist for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecated.78 usesedit the pascal pa or kilopascal kpa as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch psi unit except in some countries that still use the imperial measurement system or the us customary system including the united states geophysicists use the gigapascal gpa in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the earth medical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging and often displays the young's modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascals in materials science and engineering the pascal measures the stiffness tensile strength and compressive strength of materials in engineering use because the pascal represents a very small quantity the megapascal mpa is the preferred unit for these uses the pascal is also equivalent to the si unit of energy density j/m3 this applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases but also to the energy density of electric magnetic and gravitational fields hectopascal and millibar unitsedit the units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar which was close to the average air pressure on earth and the millibar since the introduction of si units meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals hpa unit equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar.11121314151617 exceptions include canada which use kilopascals kpa in many other fields of science the si is preferred which means pa with a prefix in multiples of 1000 is preferred.1819 many countries also use the millibar or hectopascal to give aviation altimeter settings in practically all other fields the kilopascal 1000 pascals is used instead.citation needed see alsoedit referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export languages

michigan the state's name michigan is of french origins form of the ojibwe word mishigamaa meaning large water or large lake.37 michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 united states with the 11th most extensive total area and the largest state by total area east of the mississippi river.b michigan's capital is lansing and its largest city is detroit the area was first settled by native american tribes and later colonized by french explorers in the 17th century and became part of new france after france's defeat in the french and indian war in 1762 the region came under british rule and was ceded to the newly independent united states after britain's defeat in the american revolutionary war the area was part of the larger northwest territory until 1800 when western michigan became part of the indiana territory in 1805 the michigan territory was formed and in 1837 was admitted into the union as the 26th state it soon became an important center of industry and trade in the great lakes region and a popular immigrant destination although michigan has come to develop a diverse economy it is widely known as the center of the u.s automotive industry being home to the country's three major automobile companies whose headquarters are all within the detroit metropolitan area while sparsely populated the upper peninsula is important for tourism thanks to its abundance of natural resources while the lower peninsula is a center of manufacturing services and high-tech industry  contents  history the ojibwe were established in michigan's upper peninsula and northern and central michigan and also inhabited ontario northern wisconsin southern manitoba and northern and north-central minnesota the ottawa lived primarily south of the straits of mackinac in northern western and southern michigan but also in southern ontario northern ohio and eastern wisconsin while the potawatomi were in southern and western michigan in addition to northern and central indiana northern illinois southern wisconsin and southern ontario other algonquian tribes in michigan in the south and east were the mascouten the menominee the miami the sac or sauk and the fox and the non-algonquian wyandot who are better known by their french name the huron 17th century 18th century at the same time the french strengthened fort michilimackinac at the straits of mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire by the mid-18th century the french also occupied forts at present-day niles and sault ste marie though most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by europeans france offered free land to attract families to detroit which grew to 800 people in 1765 the largest city between montreal and new orleans.16 during the american revolutionary war detroit was an important british supply center most of the inhabitants were french-canadians or native americans many of whom had been allied with the french because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 treaty of paris the british retained control of detroit and michigan after the american revolution when quebec split into lower and upper canada in 1791 michigan was part of kent county upper canada it held its first democratic elections in august 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at newark now niagara-on-the-lake.19 under terms negotiated in the 1794 jay treaty britain withdrew from detroit and michilimackinac in 1796 questions remained over the boundary for many years and the united states did not have uncontested control of the upper peninsula and drummond island until 1818 and 1847 respectively 19th century during the war of 1812 michigan territory effectively consisting of detroit and the surrounding area was surrendered after a nearly bloodless siege in 1812 an attempt to retake detroit resulted in a severe american defeat in the river raisin massacre this battle is still the bloodiest ever fought in the state and had the highest number of american casualties of any battle in the war ultimately michigan was recaptured by americans in 1813 after the battle of lake erie an invasion of canada which culminated in the battle of the thames was then launched from michigan the more northern areas were held by the british until the peace treaty restored the old boundaries a number of forts including fort wayne were built in michigan during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with britain the population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the erie canal connecting the great lakes and the hudson river and new york city the new route brought a large influx of settlers who became farmers and merchants and shipped out grain lumber and iron ore by the 1830s michigan had 80000 residents more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood a constitutional convention of assent led by gershom mott williams was held to lead the territory to statehood.20 in october 1835 the people approved the constitution of 1835 thereby forming a state government although congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a boundary dispute with ohio known as the toledo war congress awarded the toledo strip to ohio michigan received the western part of the upper peninsula as a concession and formally entered the union on january 26 1837 the upper peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber iron and copper michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to the 1880s railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward with detroit the chief hub a second wave of french canadian immigrants settled in michigan during the late 19th to early 20th century particularly in lumbering areas in counties on the lake huron side of the lower peninsula such as the saginaw valley alpena and cheboygan counties as well as throughout the upper peninsula with large concentrations in escanaba and the keweenaw peninsula.21 the first statewide meeting of

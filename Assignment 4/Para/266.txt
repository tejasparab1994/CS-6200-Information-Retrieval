light the main source of light on earth is the sun sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches which release energy into the living things that digest them this process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things historically another important source of light for humans has been fire from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps with the development of electric lights and power systems electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight some species of animals generate their own light a process called bioluminescence for example fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey the primary properties of visible light are intensity propagation direction frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization while its speed in a vacuum 299792458 metres per second is one of the fundamental constants of nature visible light as with all types of electromagnetic radiation emr is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.4  contents  electromagnetic spectrum and visible light generally em radiation or emr the designation radiation excludes static electric and magnetic and near fields is classified by wavelength into radio microwave infrared the visible region that we perceive as light ultraviolet x-rays and gamma rays the behavior of emr depends on its wavelength higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths when emr interacts with single atoms and molecules its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries emr in the visible light region consists of quanta called photons that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule at the lower end of the visible light spectrum emr becomes invisible to humans infrared because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change a change in conformation in the visual molecule retinal in the human retina which change triggers the sensation of vision there exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared but not by means of quantum-absorption infrared sensing in snakes depends on a kind of natural thermal imaging in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation emr in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects which is how these animals detect it plant growth is also affected by the color spectrum of light a process known as photomorphogenesis speed of light the effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary matter is less than in vacuum for example the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum optics the study of light and the interaction of light and matter is termed optics the observation and study of optical phenomena such as rainbows and the aurora borealis offer many clues as to the nature of light refraction refraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another it is described by snell's law when a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium or between two different media the wavelength of the light changes but the frequency remains constant if the beam of light is not orthogonal or rather normal to the boundary the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam this change of direction is known as refraction the refractive quality of lenses is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images magnifying glasses spectacles contact lenses microscopes and refracting telescopes are all examples of this manipulation light sources there are many sources of light a body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of black-body radiation a simple thermal source is sunlight the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the sun at around 6000 kelvins 5730 degrees celsius 10340 degrees fahrenheit peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units18 and roughly 44 of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.19 another example is incandescent light bulbs which emit only around 10 of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared a common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in flames but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum deceleration of a free charged particle such as an electron can produce visible radiation cyclotron radiation synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible cherenkov radiation certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence in living things this process is called bioluminescence for example fireflies produce light by this means and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake certain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation a process known as fluorescence some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation this is known as phosphorescence phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles cathodoluminescence is one example this mechanism is used in cathode ray tube television sets and computer monitors certain other mechanisms can produce light when the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons gamma rays additional generation mechanisms include units and measures light is measured with two main alternative sets of units radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardised model of human brightness perception photometry is useful for example to quantify illumination lighting intended for human use the si units for both systems are summarised in the following tables   light pressure light exerts physical pressure on objects in its path a phenomenon which can be deduced by maxwell's equations but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light photons strike and transfer their momentum light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by c the speed of light due to the magnitude of c the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects for example a one-milliwatt laser pointer exerts a force of about 3.3 piconewtons on the object being illuminated thus one could lift a u.s penny with laser pointers but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mw laser pointers.20 however in nanometre-scale applications such as nanoelectromechanical systems |nems the effect of light pressure is more significant and exploiting light pressure to drive nems mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.21 at larger scales light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster22 acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a windmill the possibility of making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.2324 although the motion of the crookes radiometer was originally attributed to light pressure this interpretation is incorrect the characteristic crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.25 this should not be confused with the nichols radiometer in which the slight motion caused by torque though not enough for full rotation against friction is directly caused by light pressure.26 as a consequence of light pressure einstein27 in 1909 predicted the existence of radiation friction which would oppose the movement of matter he wrote radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate the forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest however if it is in motion more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion front surface than on the back surface the backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back hence as the resultant of the two forces there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate we will call this resultant 'radiation friction in brief. historical theories about light in chronological order classical greece and hellenism in the fifth century bc empedocles postulated that everything was composed of four elements fire air earth and water he believed that aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible if this were true then one could see during the night just as well as during the day so empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.28 in about 300 bc euclid wrote optica in which he studied the properties of light euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically he questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye for he asks how one sees the stars immediately if one closes one's eyes then opens them at night of course if the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem.29 in 55 bc lucretius a roman who carried on the ideas of earlier greek atomists wrote that the light  heat of the sun these are composed of minute atoms which when they are shoved off lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove. from on the nature of the universe despite being similar to later particle theories lucretius's views were not generally accepted ptolemy c 2nd century wrote about the refraction of light in his book optics.30 classical india in ancient india the hindu schools of samkhya and vaisheshika from around the early centuries ad developed theories on light according to the samkhya school light is one of the five fundamental subtle elements tanmatra out of which emerge the gross elements the atomicity of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.31 on the other hand the vaisheshika school gives an atomic theory of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of ether space and time see indian atomism. the basic atoms are those of earth prthivi water pani fire agni and air vayu light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of tejas fire atoms the particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the tejas atoms.citation needed the vishnu purana refers to sunlight as the seven rays of the sun.citation needed31 descartes descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium descartes theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.32 particle theory newton's theory could be used to predict the reflection of light but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater newton published the final version of his theory in his opticks of 1704 his reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the 18th century the particle theory of light led laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it in other words it would become what is now called a black hole laplace withdrew his suggestion later after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light as has been explained neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct a translation of newton's essay on light appears in the large scale structure of space-time by stephen hawking and george f r ellis wave theory to explain the origin of colors robert hooke 1635-1703 developed a pulse theory and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work micrographia observation ix in 1672 hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be perpendicular to the direction of propagation christiaan huygens 1629-1695 worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his treatise on light in 1690 he proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous ether as waves are not affected by gravity it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.33 electromagnetic theory in 1845 michael faraday discovered that the plane of polarisation of linearly polarised light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric an effect now known as faraday rotation.36 this was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism in 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines.36 faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.citation needed faraday's work inspired james clerk maxwell to study electromagnetic radiation and light maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light from this maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation he first stated this result in 1862 in on physical lines of force in 1873 he published a treatise on electricity and magnetism which contained a full mathematical description of the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields still known as maxwell's equations soon after heinrich hertz confirmed maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light exhibiting properties such as reflection refraction diffraction and interference maxwell's theory and hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio radar television electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications in the quantum theory photons are seen as wave packets of the waves described in the classical theory of maxwell the quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that maxwell's classical theory could not such as spectral lines quantum theory in 1900 max planck attempting to explain black body radiation suggested that although light was a wave these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency planck called these lumps of light energy quanta from a latin word for how much in 1905 albert einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a real existence in 1923 arthur holly compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity x-rays scattered from electrons so called compton scattering could be explained by a particle-theory of x-rays but not a wave theory in 1926 gilbert n lewis named these light quanta particles photons.37 eventually the modern theory of quantum mechanics came to picture light as in some sense both a particle and a wave and in another sense as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave which actually are macroscopic phenomena such as baseballs or ocean waves instead modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor particles and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor water waves but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined as in the case for radio waves and the x-rays involved in compton scattering physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other visible light which occupies a middle ground in frequency can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model or sometimes both see also notes references external links navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search

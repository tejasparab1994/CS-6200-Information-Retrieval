snow roller a snow roller is a rare meteorological phenomenon in which large snowballs are formed naturally as chunks of snow are blown along the ground by wind picking up material along the way in much the same way that the large snowballs used in snowmen are made they can be as small as a tennis ball but they can also be bigger than a car.1 unlike snowballs made by people snow rollers are typically cylindrical in shape and are often hollow since the inner layers which are the first layers to form are weak and thin compared to the outer layers and can easily be blown away leaving what looks like a doughnut or swiss roll the following conditions are needed for snow rollers to form because of this last condition snow rollers are more common in hilly areas.2 however the precise nature of the conditions required makes them a very rare phenomenon the term snow roller also applies to a horse-drawn implement used in the mid to late 19th century though tractor-drawn examples are still in limited use today mainly at ski resorts to pack snow it was mainly used in areas with high snow accumulation for access for horses and horse-drawn sleighs or wagons equipped with skis or runners the implement was essentially a large very wide wooden wheel weighed down with stone or concrete.3 galleryedit on january 27 2014 these snow rollers were formed overnight during high winds in the community of venus in western pennsylvania snow roller in rocky mountain national park notice the gear type formations in this snow roller rocky mountain national park colorado snow roller can also refer to a kind of equipment to plow down smaller quantities of snow this snow roller is on exhibit at the cole land transportation museum in bangor maine referencesedit external linksedit navigation menu personal tools namespaces variants views more search navigation interaction tools print/export in other projects languages

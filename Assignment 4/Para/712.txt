arlington national cemetery the national cemetery was established during the civil war on the grounds of arlington house which had been the estate of the family of confederate general robert e lee's wife mary anna custis lee a great-granddaughter of martha washington the cemetery along with arlington house memorial drive the hemicycle and the arlington memorial bridge form the arlington national cemetery historic district listed on the national register of historic places in april 2014.23 like nearly all federal installations in arlington county it has a washington d.c mailing address in recent years the department of the army has made plans and taken actions to expand the cemetery onto public lands that the national park service nps controlled or that arlington county or the commonwealth of virginia owned as well as to restrict bicycle use within the cemetery these plans and actions have become controversial  contents  historyedit george washington parke custis grandson of martha washington acquired the land that now is arlington national cemetery in 1802 and began construction of arlington house the name is ultimately derived from the village of arlington gloucestershire england where custis family was originally from the estate passed to custis daughter mary anna who had married united states army officer robert e lee custis will gave a life inheritance to mary lee allowing her to live at and run arlington estate for the rest of her life but not enabling her to sell any portion of it.4 upon her death the arlington estate passed to her eldest son george washington custis lee.4 when virginia seceded from the union at the start of the american civil war robert e lee resigned his commission on april 20 1861 and took command of the armed forces of the commonwealth of virginia later becoming commander of the army of northern virginia.5 on may 7 troops of the virginia militia occupied arlington and arlington house.6 with confederate forces occupying arlington's high ground the capital of the union was left in an untenable military position.7 although unwilling to leave arlington house mary lee believed her estate would soon be recaptured by federal soldiers so she buried many of her family treasures on the grounds and left for her sister's estate at ravensworth in fairfax county virginia on may 14.89 on may 3 general winfield scott ordered brigadier general irvin mcdowell to clear arlington and the city of alexandria virginia of all troops not loyal to the united states.10 mcdowell occupied arlington without opposition on may 24.11 at the outbreak of the civil war most military personnel who died in battle near washington d.c. were buried at the united states soldiers cemetery in washington d.c. or alexandria cemetery in alexandria virginia but by late 1863 both were nearly full.12 on july 16 1862 congress passed legislation authorizing the u.s federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead and put the u.s army quartermaster general in charge of this program.12 in may 1864 union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the battle of the wilderness quartermaster general montgomery c meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery within weeks his staff reported that arlington estate was the most suitable property in the area.12 the property was high and free from floods which might unearth graves it had a view of the district of columbia and it was aesthetically pleasing it was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the confederate states of america and denying robert e lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration.13 the first military burial at arlington for william henry christman was made on may 13 186414 close to what is now the northeast gate in section 27.15 however meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until june 15 1864.16 arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until president harry s truman issued executive order 9981 on july 26 1948.17 president herbert hoover conducted the first national memorial day ceremony in arlington national cemetery on may 30 1929.23 freedmen's villageedit recent expansionedit on march 26 2013 the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act 2013 public law 113-6 appropriated to the dod $84 million to plan design and construct the millennium project.38 the legislation additionally appropriated to the dod $19 million to study plan and design a future expansion of the cemetery's burial space.38 navy annex property expansion controversyedit in january 2013 the county manager of arlington county virginia and the executive director of the army national military cemeteries consisting of arlington national cemetery and the united states soldiers and airmen's home national cemetery40 signed a memorandum of understanding mou between the arlington county board and the department of the army to expand the cemetery even further under the tentative plan arlington county would give up the easement for southgate road which lies between the navy annex property and the cemetery's 2012 boundary and obtain a narrow easement along the southwest border of the navy annex site for a new southgate road in exchange the department of defense would give the navy annex parking lot to the county the army would also transfer land west of south joyce street to columbia pike to arlington county additionally the commonwealth of virginia would convey to the cemetery roughly the northern half of the virginia department of transportation land bounded by south joyce street columbia pike and south washington boulevard the cloverleaf interchange between columbia pike and s washington blvd would be eliminated and the hairpin turn in columbia pike straightened to provide a safer more natural exit from s washington blvd onto columbia pike although exact acreages were not specified and the plan depended upon the commonwealth of virginia's cooperation the mou if implemented would have created a more contiguous plot of land for the cemetery.41 arlington woods expansion controversyedit on september 23 1996 the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1997 public law 104-201 authorized the secretary of the interior to transfer to the secretary of the army all of the land in section 29 that was within an arlington national cemetery interment zone and some of the land in the section that was within a robert e lee memorial preservation zone.2728 on july 12 1999 the nps issued a federal register notice that announced the availability of an environmental assessment ea for the transfer.4548 the ea stated that the interment zone contained the oldest and largest tract of climax eastern hardwood forest in arlington county this forest was the same type that once covered the arlington estate and had regenerated from trees that were present historically a forestry study determined that a representative tree was 258 years old the interment zone was also determined to contain significant archeological and cultural landscape resources in addition to those in the preservation zone.48 the ea described four alternative courses of action.48 the 2001 legislation required the secretary of the army to use the interment zone for in-ground burial sites and columbarium.30 in addition the legislation required the secretary of the interior to manage the remainder of section 29 in perpetuity to provide a natural setting and visual buffer for arlington house the robert e lee memorial.30 on march 12 2013 the corps of engineers released a revised ea for the millennium project.5354 the revised ea contained copies of a number of public comments on the draft ea that had criticized the project and parts of the ea while proposing alternative locations for new military burials near the cemetery and elsewhere.55 however the department of forestry of the commonwealth of virginia found that based on information in the draft ea the project would not have a significant adverse impact on the commonwealth's forest resources.56 the revised ea did not change the preferred alternative alternative e or the army's plans to prepare and sign the finding of no significant impact fonsi that the draft ea had described.57 2010 mismanagement controversyedit on june 9 2010 united states secretary of the army john m mchugh reprimanded the cemetery's superintendent john c metzler jr. and his deputy thurman higgenbotham after a dod inspector general's report revealed that cemetery officials had placed the wrong headstones on tombs buried coffins in shallow graves and buried bodies on top of one another.64 metzler who had already announced his intention to retire on july 2 2010 admitted some mistakes had been made but denied allegations of widespread or serious mismanagement.64 the investigation also found that cemetery employees were burdened in their day-to-day work by dysfunctional management lack of established policy and procedures and an overall unhealthy organizational climate.6566 both metzler and higgenbotham retired soon after the investigation commenced.67 in march 2011 as a result of the problems discovered kathryn condon the recently appointed executive director of the army national military cemeteries announced that the cemetery's staff had been increased from 102 to 159 she added that the cemetery was also acquiring additional equipment because they didn't have the proper equipment to do the job really to the standard they needed to do.68 the mismanagement controversy included a limitation on mass media access to funerals which also proved controversial until 2005 the cemetery's administration gave free access with the family's permission to the press to cover funerals at the cemetery according to the washington post in 2008 the cemetery gradually imposed increasing restrictions on media coverage of funerals beginning about 2005.69 management turnoveredit after the cemetery's management controversy began to end the army appointed patrick k hallinan the acting superintendent of the cemetery in june 2010 he was promoted permanently to the position in october 2010 hallinan had previously worked for the office of field programs in the national cemetery administration an agency of the united states department of veterans affairs in that capacity hallinan had oversight of 131 national cemeteries national cemetery policy procedures and operations.70 hallinan was promoted to executive director of the army national military cemeteries upon the retirement of kathryn condon in spring 2014.71 in may 2014 hallinan stepped down and was replaced by jack e lechner jr as superintendent of the cemetery lechner had been a funeral director for 10 years in the private sector before joining the u.s army he rose to the rank of colonel retiring in november 2011 having spent 2008 to 2010 as chief of the supply division of the joint chiefs of staff overseeing the equipping of iraqi and afghanistan national security forces since june 2010 he had served as executive officer and deputy superintendent of the cemetery under hallinan.71 the army removed lechner as superintendent of the cemetery in early august 2015 after a performance review called into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader the army declined to elaborate further and appointed hallinan to be the temporary cemetery superintendent until the army could find a successor.72 wreaths across americaedit beginning in 1992 the morrill worcester wreath company in harrington maine had a surplus at the end of the holiday season recalling a boyhood trip to the cemetery worcester donated to the cemetery 5000 wreaths to honor the cemetery's dead with the help of volunteers and a local trucking company after thirteen years of similar donations in 2005 a photo of snowy gravestones covered with wreaths at the cemetery received widespread circulation on the internet thousands of people called worcester wanting to replicate the wreath-laying service at their own veteran cemeteries.73 in 2006 over 150 different locations simultaneously held ceremonies with arlington's additionally the project had its first veterans honor parade with patriot guard riders who escorted the wreaths from maine to the cemetery the parade which is held each year now visits schools monuments veterans homes and communities along its route.73 at the end of 2006 worcester's company supplied wreaths to over 230 state and national cemeteries and veterans monuments across the country.74 assisted by veterans and truckers worcester established in 2007 a nonprofit organization named wreaths across america.73 in december 2008 the united states senate agreed to a resolution that designated december 13 2008 as wreaths across america day.75 in 2014 volunteers placed over 700000 memorial wreaths at 1000 locations in the united states and overseas including the uss arizona memorial at pearl harbor bunker hill valley forge and the national september 11 memorial at the world trade center site in new york city during that year volunteers were able to place wreaths in all sections of the cemetery for the first time.73 in 2016 this number increased to 1.2 million wreaths being placed at more than 1230 cemeteries across the nation.76 conflict of interest charges have been made against wreaths across america because this charity has an exclusive for-profit supplier worcestor wreath company also run by the morrill family in the same town the charity's purchases of wreaths from this company account for most of the company's revenue and profits in late 2015 the wall street journal reported serious conflicts of interest with potential malfeasance in governance and contracting.77 in 2015 alone the wsj reported profits of over $1 million on sales of over 850000 wreaths to the charity raising concerns about competitive bidding reporting that several competitors had asked to bid significantly below the price offered by worcestor wreath company but were denied access 150th anniversaryedit during may and june 2014 the cemetery celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding with a month-long series of events tours and lectures.78 during these celebrations cemetery officials formally re-designated the old amphitheater as the james tanner amphitheater james r tanner was a union army officer who lost both legs during the war he later became a war department stenographer and recorded much of the early evidence in the investigation into the assassination of abraham lincoln he later was active in the grand army of the republic a union army veterans group tanner is buried a few yards from the amphitheater.79 sectionsedit grave markers niches and headstonesedit the united states department of veterans affairs oversees the national cemetery administration's orders86 for placement of inscriptions and faith emblems at no charge to the estate of the deceased submitted with information provided by the next of kin87 that is placed on upright marble headstones or columbarium niche covers the department of veterans affairs currently offers 63 authorized faith emblems for placement on markers to represent the deceased's faith.88 this number has grown in recent years due to legal challenges to policy.89 prior to 2007 the united states department of veterans affairs va did not allow the use of the pentacle as an emblem of belief on tombstones in military cemeteries this policy was changed following an out-of-court settlement on april 23 following a series of lawsuits by the family of patrick stewart against the va.909192 between 1947 and 2001 privately purchased markers were permitted in the cemetery the sections in which the cemetery permitted such markers are nearly filled and the cemetery generally does not allow new burials in these sections.93 nevertheless the older sections of the cemetery have a wide variety of private markers placed prior to 2001 including an artillery piece.94 there are 32 commonwealth war dead burials and some headstones are commonwealth war graves commission style arlington memorial amphitheateredit the tomb of the

armistice day november 11 1921 later covered in 1931 by a more elaborate marble sarcophagus.99 other memorialsedit there are several memorials on the grounds of the cemetery however due to the lack of space for burials and the large amount of space that memorials take up the u.s army now requires a joint or concurrent resolution from congress before it will place new memorials at arlington the

cemetery unless otherwise prohibited.108 the last period of active duty of former members of the armed forces must have ended honorably interment may be of casketed or cremated remains inurnment criteria for columbariumedit due at least partly to the lack of space at the cemetery for ground burial standards for inurnment burial of cremated remains in the columbarium are currently much less

crimes as defined in 38 u.s code  2411 capital crime is a specifically defined term in the statute and for state offenses can include offenses that are eligible for a life sentence with or without parole the reasoning for this provision originally was to prevent timothy mcveigh from being eligible at arlington national cemetery but it has since been amended to prevent others.109 also prohibited under the same statute are those determined with clear and convincing evidence to have avoided such conviction by death or flight notable burialsedit the first soldier to be buried in arlington was

the wampanoag and lenape the lenape also controlled most of the region surrounding new york harbor north of the lenape was a third algonquin nation the mohicans starting north of them from east to west were three iroquoian nations the mohawk the original iroquois and the petun south of them divided roughly along appalachia were the susquehannock and the erie.333435363738 many of the wampanoag and mohican peoples were caught up in king phillip's war a joint effort of many new england tribes to push europeans off their land after the death of their leader chief phillip metcomet most of those peoples fled inland splitting into the abenaki and the schaghticoke many of the mohicans remained in the region until the 1800s 39 however a small group known as the ouabano migrated southwest into west virginia at an earlier time they may have merged with the shawnee 40 41 meanwhile the lenape formed a close relationship with william penn however upon penn's death his sons managed to take over much of their lands and banish them to ohio.45 when the u.s drafted the indian removal act the lenape were further moved to missouri whereas their cousins the mohicans were sent to wisconsin also in 1778 the united states relocated the nanticoke from the delmarva peninsula to the former iroquois lands south of lake ontario however they did not stay long mostly they chose to migrate into canada  merged with the iroquois although some moved west and merged with the lenape 46 16th century in 1524 giovanni da verrazzano an italian explorer in the service of the french crown explored the atlantic coast of north america between the carolinas and newfoundland including new york harbor and narragansett bay on april 17 1524 verrazanno entered new york bay by way of the strait now called the narrows into the northern bay which he named santa margherita in honor of the king of france's sister verrazzano described it as a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass and he adds that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake this vast sheet of water swarmed with native boats he landed on the tip of manhattan and possibly on the furthest point of long island verrazanno's stay was interrupted by a storm which pushed him north towards martha's vineyard.47 in 1540 french traders from new france built a chateau on castle island within present-day albany due to flooding it was abandoned the next year in 1614 the dutch under the command of hendrick corstiaensen rebuilt the french chateau which they called fort nassau fort nassau was the first dutch settlement in north america and was located along the hudson river also within present-day albany the small fort served as a trading post and warehouse located on the hudson river flood plain the rudimentary fort was washed away by flooding in 161748 and abandoned for good after fort orange new netherland was built nearby in 1623.49 17th century henry hudson's 1609 voyage marked the beginning of european involvement with the area sailing for the dutch east india company and looking for a passage to asia he entered the upper new york bay on september 11 of that year.50 word of his findings encouraged dutch merchants to explore the coast in search for profitable fur trading with local native american tribes 18th century the american revolution and statehood the sons of liberty were organized in new york city during the 1760s largely in response to the oppressive stamp act passed by the british parliament in 1765 the stamp act congress met in the city on october 19 of that year composed of representatives from across the thirteen colonies who set the stage for the continental congress to follow the stamp act congress resulted in the declaration of rights and grievances which was the first written expression by representatives of the americans of many of the rights and complaints later expressed in the united states declaration of independence this included the right to representative government at the same time given strong trading between britain and the united states on both business and personal levels many new york residents were loyalists the capture of fort ticonderoga provided the cannon and gunpowder necessary to force a british withdrawal from the siege of boston in 1775 new york was the only colony to not vote for independence as the delegates were not authorized to do so new york then endorsed the declaration of independence on july 9 1776.52 the new york state constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at white plains on july 10 1776 and after repeated adjournments and changes of location terminated its labors at kingston on sunday evening april 20 1777 when the new constitution drafted by john jay was adopted with but one dissenting vote it was not submitted to the people for ratification on july 30 1777 george clinton was inaugurated as the first governor of new york at kingston in an attempt to retain their sovereignty and remain an independent nation positioned between the new united states and british north america four of the iroquois nations fought on the side of the british only the oneida and their dependents the tuscarora allied themselves with the americans.53 in retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by joseph brant and loyalist mohawk forces the sullivan expedition of 1779 destroyed nearly 50 iroquois villages adjacent croplands and winter stores forcing many refugees to british-held niagara.54 both the dutch and the british imported african slaves as laborers to the city and colony new york had the second-highest population of slaves after charleston south carolina slavery was extensive in new york city and some agricultural areas the state passed a law for the gradual abolition of slavery soon after the revolutionary war but the last slave in new york was not freed until 1827 19th century transportation in western new york was by expensive wagons on muddy roads before canals opened up the rich farm lands to long-distance traffic governor dewitt clinton promoted the erie canal that connected new york city to the great lakes by the hudson river the new canal and the rivers and lakes work commenced in 1817 and the erie canal opened in 1825 packet boats pulled by horses on tow paths traveled slowly over the canal carrying passengers and freight.58 farm products came in from the midwest and finished manufactured moved west it was an engineering marvel which opened up vast areas of new york to commerce and settlement it enabled great lakes port cities such as buffalo and rochester to grow and prosper it also connected the burgeoning agricultural production of the midwest and shipping on the great lakes with the port of new york city improving transportation it enabled additional population migration to territories west of new york after 1850 railroads largely replaced the canal.59 new york city was a major ocean port and had extensive traffic importing cotton from the south and exporting manufacturing goods nearly half of the state's exports were related to cotton southern cotton factors planters and bankers visited so often that they had favorite hotels.60 at the same time activism for abolitionism was strong upstate where some communities provided stops on the underground railroad upstate and new york city gave strong support for the american civil war in terms of finances volunteer soldiers and supplies the state provided more than 370000 soldiers to the union armies over 53000 new yorkers died in service roughly one of every seven who served however irish draft riots in 1862 were a significant embarrassment.6162 immigration since the early 19th century new york city has been the largest port of entry for legal immigration into the united states in the united states the federal government did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890 prior to this time the matter was delegated to the individual states then via contract between the states and the federal government most immigrants to new york would disembark at the bustling docks along the hudson and east rivers in the eventual lower manhattan on may 4 1847 the new york state legislature created the board of commissioners of immigration to regulate immigration.63 the first permanent immigration depot in new york was established in 1855 at castle garden a converted war of 1812 era fort located within what is now battery park at the tip of lower manhattan the first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from quarantine castle garden served as new york's immigrant depot until it closed on april 18 1890 when the federal government assumed control over immigration during that period more than 8 million immigrants passed through its doors two out of every three u.s immigrants.64 when the federal government assumed control it established the bureau of immigration which chose the three-acre ellis island in upper new york harbor for an entry depot already federally controlled the island had served as an ammunition depot it was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to new york city and the rail lines of jersey city new jersey via a short ferry ride while the island was being developed and expanded via land reclamation the federal government operated a temporary depot at the barge office at the battery.65 more than 12 million immigrants passed through ellis island between 1892 and 1954 more than 100 million americans across the united states can trace their ancestry to these immigrants september 11 2001 attacks on september 11 2001 two of four hijacked planes were flown into the twin towers of the original world trade center in lower manhattan and the towers collapsed 7 world trade center also collapsed due to damage from fires the other buildings of the world trade center complex were damaged beyond repair and demolished soon thereafter the collapse of the twin towers caused extensive damage and resulted in the deaths of 2753 victims including 147 aboard the two planes since september 11 most of lower manhattan has been restored in the years since many rescue workers and residents of the area have developed several life-threatening illnesses and some have died.68 hurricane sandy 2012 on october 29 and 30 2012 hurricane sandy caused extensive destruction of the state's shorelines ravaging portions of new york city and long island with record-high storm surge with severe flooding and high winds causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of new yorkers and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems the storm and its profound effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of new york city and long island to minimize the risk from another such future event this is considered highly probable due to global warming and rise in sea levels.7071 geography in contrast with new york city's urban landscape the vast majority of the state's geographic area is dominated by meadows forests rivers farms mountains and lakes most of the southern part of the state rests on the allegheny plateau which extends from the southeastern united states to the catskill mountains the section in new york state is known as the southern tier the rugged adirondack mountains with vast tracts of wilderness lie west of the lake champlain valley the great appalachian valley dominates eastern new york and contains the lake champlain valley as its northern half and the hudson valley as its southern half within the state the tug hill region arises as a cuesta east of lake ontario.73 new york contains a part of the marcellus shale which extends into ohio and pennsylvania.77 water borders of new york state's total area 13.6 consists of water.78 much of new york's boundaries are in water as is true for new york city four of its five boroughs are situated on three islands at the mouth of the hudson river manhattan island staten island and long island which contains brooklyn and queens at its western end the state's borders include a water boundary in clockwise from the west two great lakes lake erie and lake ontario which are connected by the niagara river the provinces of ontario and quebec in canada with new york and ontario sharing the thousand islands archipelago within the saint lawrence river while most of its border with quebec is on land it shares lake champlain with the new england state of vermont the new england state of massachusetts has mostly a land border while connecticut has land and sea borders new york extends into long island sound and the atlantic ocean sharing a water border with rhode island except for areas near the new york harbor new york has a mostly land border with two mid-atlantic states new jersey and pennsylvania new york is the only state that includes within its borders parts of the great lakes and the atlantic ocean drainage the hudson river begins near lake tear of the clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining lakes george or champlain lake george empties at its north end into lake champlain whose northern end extends into canada where it drains into the richelieu river and then ultimately the saint lawrence river the western section of the state is drained by the allegheny river and rivers of the susquehanna and delaware river systems niagara falls is shared between new york and ontario as it flows on the niagara river from lake erie to lake ontario the delaware river basin compact signed in 1961 by new york new jersey pennsylvania delaware and the federal government regulates the utilization of water of the delaware system.79 climate downstate new york comprising new york city long island and lower portions of the hudson valley has rather warm summers with some periods of high humidity and cold damp winters which however are relatively mild compared to temperatures in upstate new york secondary to the former region's lower elevation proximity to the atlantic ocean and relatively lower latitude compared to the latter upstate new york experiences warm summers marred by only occasional brief intervals of sultry conditions with long and cold winters western new york particularly the tug hill region receives heavy lake-effect snows especially during the earlier portions of winter before the surface of lake ontario itself is covered by ice the summer climate is cool in the adirondacks catskills and at higher elevations of the southern tier new york ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of greenhouse gases generated per person this relative efficient energy usage is primarily due to the dense compact settlement in the new york city metropolitan area and the state population's high rate of mass transit use in this area and between major cities.81 ecology regions due to its long history new york has several overlapping and often conflicting definitions of regions within the state the regions are also not fully definable due to colloquial use of regional labels the new york state department of economic development provides two distinct definitions of these regions it divides the state into ten economic regions82 which approximately correspond to terminology used by residents the department also groups the counties into eleven regions for tourism purposes:83 state parks the 1797 montauk lighthouse commissioned under president george washington is a major tourist attraction in montauk state park at the easternmost tip of long island hither hills state park also on the south fork of long island offers camping and is a popular destination with surfcasting sport fishermen national parks monuments and historic landmarks the state of new york is well represented in the national park system with 22 national parks which received 16349381 visitors in 2011 in addition there are 4 national heritage areas 27 national natural landmarks 262 national historic landmarks and 5379 listings on the national register of historic places administrative divisions new york is divided into 62 counties aside from the five counties of new york city each of these counties is subdivided into towns and cities incorporated under state law towns can contain incorporated villages or unincorporated hamlets new york city is divided into five boroughs each coterminous with a county downstate new york new york city long island and the southern portion of the hudson valley can be considered to form the central core of the northeast megalopolis an urbanized region stretching from new hampshire to virginia the major cities of the state developed along the key transportation and trade routes of the early 19th century including the erie canal and railroads paralleling it today the new york thruway acts as a modern counterpart to commercial water routes.95 demographics population the distribution of change in population growth is uneven in new york state the new york city metropolitan area is growing considerably along with saratoga county.98 new york city gained more residents between april 2010 and july 2014 316000 than any other u.s city.99 conversely outside of the ithaca area population growth in much of western new york is nearly stagnant.98 according to immigration statistics the state is a leading recipient of migrants from around the globe between 2000 and 2005 immigration failed to surpass emigration a trend that has been reversing since 2006 new york state lost two house seats in the 2011 congressional reapportionment secondary to relatively slow growth when compared to the rest of the united states in

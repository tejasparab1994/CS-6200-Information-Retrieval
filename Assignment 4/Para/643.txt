united states dollar since the suspension in 19718 of convertibility of paper u.s currency into any precious metal the u.s dollar is de facto fiat money9 as it is the most used in international transactions the u.s dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.10 several countries use it as their official currency and in many others it is the de facto currency.11 besides the united states it is also used as the sole currency in two british overseas territories in the caribbean the british virgin islands and turks and caicos islands a few countries use the federal reserve notes for paper money while still minting their own coins or also accept u.s dollar coins such as the susan b anthony dollar as of september 20 2017 there was approximately $1.58 trillion in circulation of which $1.53 trillion was in federal reserve notes the remaining $50 billion is in the form of coins.12  contents  overviewedit the constitution provides that a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.15 that provision of the constitution is made specific by section 331 of title 31 of the united states code.16 the sums of money reported in the statements are currently being expressed in u.s dollars for example see the 2009 financial report of the united states government.17 the u.s dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the united states etymologyedit the coins minted at joachimsthal soon lent their name to other coins of similar size and weight from other places one such example was a dutch coin depicting a lion hence its dutch name leeuwendaler in english lion dollar the leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .75 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 and 42 stuivers it was lighter than the large-denomination coins then in circulation thus it was more advantageous for a dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade the leeuwendaler was popular in the dutch east indies and in the dutch new netherland colony new york and circulated throughout the thirteen colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries it was also popular throughout eastern europe where it led to the current romanian and moldovan currency being called leu literally lion nicknamesedit the colloquialism bucks much like the british word quids pl for the pound sterling is often used to refer to dollars of various nations including the u.s dollar this term dating to the 18th century may have originated with the colonial leather trade it may also have originated from a poker term.23 greenback is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century demand note dollars created by abraham lincoln to finance the costs of the civil war for the north.24 the original note was printed in black and green on the back side it is still used to refer to the u.s dollar but not to the dollars of other countries other well-known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include greenmail green and dead presidents the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills a grand sometimes shortened to simply g is a common term for the amount of $1000 the suffix k or k from kilo- is also commonly used to denote this amount such as $10k to mean $10000 however the $1000 note is no longer in general use a large or stack it is usually a reference to a multiple of $1000 such as fifty large meaning $50000 the $100 note is nicknamed benjamin benji ben or franklin after benjamin franklin c-note c being the roman numeral for 100 century note or bill e.g two bills being $200 the $50 note is occasionally called a yardstick or a grant after president ulysses s grant pictured on the obverse the $20 note is referred to as a double sawbuck jackson after andrew jackson or double eagle the $10 note is referred to as a sawbuck ten-spot or hamilton after alexander hamilton the $5 note as lincoln fin fiver or five-spot the infrequently-used $2 note is sometimes called deuce tom or jefferson after thomas jefferson the $1 note as a single or buck the dollar has also been referred to as a bone and bones in plural e.g twenty bones is equal to $20 the newer designs with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse rather than in cameo insets upon paper color-coded by denomination are sometimes referred to as bigface notes or monopoly money piastre was the original french word for the u.s dollar used for example in the french text of the louisiana purchase calling the dollar a piastre is still common among the speakers of cajun french and new england french modern french uses dollar for this unit of currency as well the term is still used as slang for u.s dollars in the french-speaking caribbean islands most notably haiti dollar signedit another popular explanation is that it is derived from the pillars of hercules on the spanish coat of arms of the spanish dollar these pillars of hercules on the silver spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars || and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an s yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters u and s written or printed one on top of the other this theory popularized by novelist ayn rand in atlas shrugged29 does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the united states.30 historyedit the american dollar coin was initially based on the value and look of the spanish dollar used widely in spanish america from the 16th to the 19th centuries the first dollar coins issued by the united states mint founded 1792 were similar in size and composition to the spanish dollar minted in mexico and peru the spanish u.s silver dollars and later mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the united states and the spanish dollar and mexican peso remained legal tender until the coinage act of 1857 the coinage of various english colonies also circulated the lion dollar was popular in the dutch new netherland colony new york but the lion dollar also circulated throughout the english colonies during the 17th century and early 18th century examples circulating in the colonies were usually worn so that the design was not fully distinguishable thus they were sometimes referred to as dog dollars.31 the early currency of the united states did not exhibit faces of presidents as is the custom now;34 although today by law only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on united states currency.35 in fact the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency a practice compared to the policies of european monarchs.36 the currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century before that heads side of coinage used profile faces and striding seated and standing figures from greek and roman mythology and composite native americans the last coins to be converted to profiles of historic americans were the dime 1946 and the dollar 1971 for articles on the currencies of the colonies and states see connecticut pound delaware pound georgia pound maryland pound massachusetts pound new hampshire pound new jersey pound new york pound north carolina pound pennsylvania pound rhode island pound south carolina pound and virginia pound continental currencyedit continental currency depreciated badly during the war giving rise to the famous phrase not worth a continental.37 a primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between congress and the states which continued to issue bills of credit additionally neither congress nor the governments of the several states had the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of bonds.38 the currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of 1 silver dollar to 1000 continental dollars silver and gold standardsedit in 1862 paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals due to the civil war silver and gold coins continued to be issued and in 1878 the link between paper money and coins was reinstated this disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the war of 1812 the use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the articles of confederation from 1777 to 1788 with no solid backing and being easily counterfeited the continentals quickly lost their value giving rise to the phrase not worth a continental this was a primary reason for the no state shall.. make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts clause in article 1 section 10 of the united states constitution in addition to treasury notes in 1861 congress authorized the treasury to borrow $50 million in the form of demand notes which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals however by december 1861 the union government's supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily the following february congress passed the legal tender act of 1862 issuing united states notes which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest but were legal tender meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs however silver and gold coins continued to be issued resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through gresham's law in 1869 supreme court ruled in hepburn v griswold that congress could not require creditors to accept united states notes but overturned that ruling the next year in the legal tender cases in 1875 congress passed the specie payment resumption act requiring the treasury to allow us notes to be redeemed for gold after january 1 1879 the treasury ceased to issue united states notes in 1971 between 1968 and 1975 a variety of pegs to gold were put in place eventually culminating in a sudden end on august 15 1971 to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the nixon shock the last peg was $42.22 per ouncecitation needed before the u.s dollar was let to freely float on currency markets according to the bureau of engraving and printing the largest note it ever printed was the $100000 gold certificate series 1934 these notes were printed from december 18 1934 through january 9 1935 and were issued by the treasurer of the united states to federal reserve banks only against an equal amount of gold bullion held by the treasury these notes were used for transactions between federal reserve banks and were not circulated among the general public coinsedit official united states coins have been produced every year from 1792 to the present discontinued coin denominations include collector coins for which everyday transactions are non-existent.39 technically all these coins are still legal tender at face value though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value and for gold and silver coins their precious metal value from 1965 to 1970 the kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any silver content which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel however since 1992 the u.s mint has produced special silver proof sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes quarters and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions in addition an experimental $4.00 stella coin was also minted in 1879 but never placed into circulation and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination the $50 coin mentioned was only produced in 1915 for the panama-pacific international exposition 1915 celebrating the opening of the panama canal only 1128 were made 645 of which were octagonal this remains the only u.s coin that was not round as well as the largest and heaviest u.s coin ever produced a $100 gold coin was produced in high relief during 2015 although it was primarily produced for collectors not for general circulation.40 from 1934 to present the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny nickel dime quarter half dollar and dollar the nickel is the only coin still in use today that is essentially unchanged except in its design from its original version every year since 1866 the nickel has been 75 copper and 25 nickel except for 4 years during world war ii when nickel was needed for the war due to the penny's low value some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating coinage.4142 collector coinsedit the united states mint produces proof sets specifically for collectors and speculators silver proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime quarter and half dollar containing 90 silver starting in 1983 and ending in 1997 the mint also produced proof sets containing the year's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins another type of proof set is the presidential dollar proof set where four special $1 coins are minted each year featuring a president because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on december 13 2011 by u.s treasury secretary timothy f geithner future minting of such coins will be made solely for collectors.43 dollar coinsedit  the first united states dollar was minted in 1794 known as the flowing hair dollar contained 416 grains of standard silver 89.25 silver and 10.75 copper as specified by section 1344 of the coinage act of 1792 it was designated by section 9 of that act as having the value of a spanish milled dollar dollar coins have not been very popular in the united states.45 silver dollars were minted intermittently from 1794 through 1935 a copper-nickel dollar of the same large size featuring president dwight d eisenhower was minted from 1971 through 1978 gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century the susan b anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979 these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters due to their nearly equal size their milled edge and their similar color minting of these dollars for circulation was suspended in 1980 collectors pieces were struck in 1981 but as with all past u.s coins they remain legal tender as the number of anthony dollars held by the federal reserve and dispensed primarily to make change in postal and transit vending machines had been virtually exhausted additional anthony dollars were struck in 1999 in 2000 a new $1 coin featuring sacagawea the sacagawea dollar was introduced which corrected some of the problems of the anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the anthony dollar however this new coin has failed to achieve the popularity of the still-existing $1 bill and is rarely used in daily transactions the failure to simultaneously withdraw the dollar bill and weak publicity efforts have been cited by coin proponents as primary reasons for the failure of the dollar coin to gain popular support.46 early releases of the washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the philadelphia mint to florida and tennessee banks highly sought after by collectors and trading for as much as $850 each within a week of discovery the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions e pluribus unum in god we trust 2007 p the mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly philadelphia although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to heads some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying upside down lettering error coins.49 some cynics also erroneously point out that the federal reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years whereas coins are more permanent the fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes which have been withdrawn from circulation bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones as most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes they commonly accept only $1 bills though a few will give change in dollar coins mint marksedit notesedit banknotesedit the u.s constitution provides that congress shall have the power to borrow money on the credit of the united states.50 congress has exercised that power by authorizing federal reserve banks to issue federal reserve notes those notes are obligations of the united states and shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the treasury department of the united states in the city of washington district of columbia or at any federal reserve bank.51 federal reserve notes are designated by law as legal tender for the payment of debts.52 congress has also authorized the issuance of more than 10 other types of banknotes including the united states note53 and the federal reserve bank note the federal reserve note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s currently printed denominations are $1 $2 $5 $10 $20 $50 and $100 notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969 these notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime it was the latter usage that prompted president richard nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use with the advent of electronic banking they became less necessary notes in denominations of $500 $1000 $5000 $10000 and $100000 were all produced at one time see large denomination bills in u.s currency for details with the exception of the $100000 bill which was only issued as a series 1934 gold certificate and was never publicly circulated thus it is illegal to own these notes are now collectors items and are worth more than their face value to collectors though still predominantly green post-2004 series incorporate other colors to better distinguish different denominations as a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the american council of the blind the bureau of engraving and printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill it also plans larger higher-contrast numerals more color differences and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period.54 means of issueedit the monetary base consists of coins and federal reserve notes in circulation outside the federal reserve banks and the u.s treasury plus deposits held by depository institutions at federal reserve banks the adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately 400 billion dollars in 1994 to 800 billion in 2005 and over 3000 billion in 2013.55 the amount of cash in circulation is increased or decreased by the actions of the federal reserve system eight times a year the 12-person federal open market committee meets to determine u.s monetary policy.56 every business day the federal reserve system engages in open market operations to carry out that monetary policy.57 if the federal reserve desires to increase the money supply it will buy securities such as u.s treasury bonds anonymously from banks in exchange for dollars conversely it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars to take dollars out of circulation.58 usually the short-term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target in other instances monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold for example in the case of the united states the federal reserve targets the federal funds rate the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight the other primary means of conducting monetary policy include i discount window lending as lender of last resort ii fractional deposit lending changes in the reserve requirement iii moral suasion cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes iv open mouth operations talking monetary policy with the market valueedit the 6th paragraph of section 8 of article 1 of the u.s constitution provides that the u.s congress shall have the power to coin money and to regulate the value of domestic and foreign coins congress exercised those powers when it enacted the coinage act of 1792 that act provided for the minting of the first u.s dollar and it declared that the u.s dollar shall have the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current.60 the table to the right shows the equivalent amount of goods that in a particular year could be purchased with $1 the table shows that from 1774 through 2012 the u.s dollar has lost about 97.0 of its buying power.61 under the bretton woods system established after world war ii the value of gold was fixed to $35 per ounce and the value of the u.s dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold rising government spending in the 1960s however led to doubts about the ability of the united states to maintain this convertibility gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the united states would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by president nixon resulting in the nixon shock.68 the value of the u.s dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold and it fell upon the federal reserve to maintain the value of the u.s currency the federal reserve however continued to increase the money supply resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the u.s dollar in the 1970s this was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked the phillips curve and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign.68 between 1965 and 1981 the u.s dollar lost two thirds of its value.61 in 1979 president carter appointed paul volcker chairman of the federal reserve the federal reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the 1980s and hence the value of the u.s dollar stabilized.68 there is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation which would mean a constant value for the u.s dollar over time or low stable inflation which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time as is the case now although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the u.s dollar67 others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed.70 exchange ratesedit
